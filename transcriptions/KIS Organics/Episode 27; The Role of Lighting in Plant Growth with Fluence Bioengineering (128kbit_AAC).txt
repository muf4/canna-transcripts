[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's about time that I did a
podcast focused just on lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a topic that I'm all that
strong on, so it was great to sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: with some experts in the field and get to
ask some questions to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guests this week are Travis Williams
and Travis Higginbotham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, two Travises, so it's a little tricky
to tell them apart, but between the two of
[SPEAKER_00]: them we get to hear about very different
aspects of the lighting industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis Williams is the director of brand
marketing at Fluence Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is passionate about clean energy,
sustainability, and controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: His job allows him to help growers
navigate the challenging and complex world
[SPEAKER_00]: of horticultural lighting to realize
improvement in crop production,
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability, and profits through LED
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis Higginbotham is the new director of
cultivation support for Fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to working at Fluence, he worked at
a state-of-the-art, environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled greenhouse covering 50 acres
where he was the head of research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew annual and perennial crops for
big box retailers supplying the Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: His focus was on rearing beneficial
insects, IPM protocols, disease testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and trialing new genetics from around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently received his master's in
horticulture from Virginia Tech where he
[SPEAKER_00]: did some work around LED research in
regards to soil source, supplemental,
[SPEAKER_00]: and photoperiodic lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resulted in equipping irrigation
booms with lights for photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering applications to a controlled
environment where he propagated over 1.2
[SPEAKER_00]: million perennials from stage three tissue
culture per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has a bachelor's of science from
Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast, we go over a bit of the
history of lighting as it relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants as well as the future of
lighting and what exciting research is
[SPEAKER_00]: currently being done in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get started finding out a little bit
about your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have two Travis's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Travis Williams, you can tell us a
little bit more about how you came to the
[SPEAKER_00]: role that you have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gladly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent about 13 years in high-tech
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last three of those years have been
with Fluence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the decade before that was across
different industries, both high-tech and
[SPEAKER_02]: green tech, everything from embedded
systems to alternative fuels, all B2B
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, large and small, with a core
emphasis on efficiency and really moving
[SPEAKER_02]: the world towards a more sustainable,
efficient future with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: different technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then about three years ago, I started to
see the convergence of technology and
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture with vertical farming and
different technologies that were coming on
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what spurred my interest in
looking at how to take technology and make
[SPEAKER_02]: it very applicable to our agriculture
industry and our food supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined Fluence about three years ago
when it was BML Horticulture, a small
[SPEAKER_02]: company back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was about 10 of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a pretty wild ride ever since,
quite a different industry in the
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture lighting space than the
industries of the customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were very large established
industries with standards and protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been kind of like the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great to see it evolve even over
the last three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing where it goes
over the next decade or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other Travis came recommended to
me by Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plug lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, if you want to talk to someone
about lighting, she had met you and said
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had just been hired by Fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which worked out really well since I'd
already been talking about having someone
[SPEAKER_00]: from Fluence on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk briefly about what your
background is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I would be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past five years, I've worked in the
ornamental market, so like annuals,
[SPEAKER_01]: perennials, and flowering crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did there is I worked for a
commercial greenhouse in Virginia and I
[SPEAKER_01]: directed their research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did everything from rearing of
microorganisms for biocontrol to using
[SPEAKER_01]: light in multiple environments,
controlled environments, supplemental,
[SPEAKER_01]: using it on different machinery for photo
period and flowering, to introducing new
[SPEAKER_01]: products to market, new genetics,
new varieties, trialing them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore many hats, let's just say,
in that regard to what my role was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm new to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't my area of expertise by any
means, so I may ask some really dumb
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot at Photo X this past year
in terms of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for listeners who aren't as
experienced with lighting, can we go over
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the basic terminology that people
should know when it comes to understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is probably the foundation
where everything starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's widely overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's widely misunderstood in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most industries you look at, people when
they're evaluating something and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at maybe making a big purchase or
changing something in their factory,
[SPEAKER_02]: they typically know the terminology and
they know the metrics that they're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've found in this industry is that
lighting is largely misunderstood and
[SPEAKER_02]: largely unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been making purchase
decisions, cultivation decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without really understanding the key
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is a large part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go over maybe about five key terms
that I think if growers could understand
[SPEAKER_02]: these five things, it will not only make
them better in the garden, but then when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes time to actually making a
purchase decision, it can be an educated
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one I'll start off with is
called PAR, P-A-R.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an acronym for photosynthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really defines the spectrum of light
that plants use for photosynthesis from
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at light, light is
electromagnetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything from gamma rays to radio
waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: PAR is a very narrow band kind of in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also aligns with the visual spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants and humans both use the same
spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans use it completely different than
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually perceive it differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where our eyes are really skewed towards
the green portion of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: plants use 400 to 700 nanometers almost
equally, but differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're looking at light, the quality
of light really has an impact on plant
[SPEAKER_02]: growth and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: PAR is a type of spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people refer to
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spectrum absolutely has an impact on plant
growth and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether something is heavy in red,
heavy in blue, heavy in green,
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy in orange, whether it includes UV or
far red, it will absolutely have an impact
[SPEAKER_02]: on plant growth and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's PAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the quality of light that you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have the intensity of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's defined as PPF, another acronym.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stands for photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the amount of light within the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the PAR region, that is emitted by a
light fixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total amount of photons that are
emitted between 400 and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will give you the PPF of a light
fixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next step there is to add the
density to that so you get PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to help a grower really know
how much intensity is being delivered to
[SPEAKER_02]: their crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's measured in micromoles per square
meter per second.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to tell you the light
intensity at any given point in time in
[SPEAKER_02]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can measure that with a quantum
sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get lighting designs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We provide lighting designs that will give
growers a good estimate of what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be receiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other measurement that's important is
wattage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a pretty sticky topic that
we'll probably get into later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wattage is really the measurement of
electricity input.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how much power a light fixture is
consuming measured in watts one joule per
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wattage doesn't tell you anything about
how powerful or how high performing a
[SPEAKER_02]: fixture is in terms of light output.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's just a matter of what is your
electric bill going to be at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many amps are you going to be
consuming for a light fixture?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a critical requirement in
knowing from that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of plant growth, it's not going
to tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The final one is efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's measured in micromole per joule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the analogy of miles per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really going to tell you how
efficient a fixture is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to determine what the
difference is between two lighting systems
[SPEAKER_02]: from different manufacturers that maybe
both consume 500 watts, but they have
[SPEAKER_02]: different claims, you really want to look
at the efficacy of that fixture and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how efficient is that fixture
at converting electrons into photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I make sure I understand all these
terms correctly myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about PPFD, you're talking
about light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much photons and the density of those
photons are going to be actually hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: your canopy or your plant down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about PAR, you're looking at
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk into a hydro shop and see a
Hortilux bulb or a NanoLux bulb on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and they have those charts on the
back with the red and the green spikes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your PAR level in terms of the
spectrum that you're getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I saying that correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have PPFD down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to PAR and spectrum,
it gets a little more complicated because
[SPEAKER_02]: within PAR, you can have different
allocation of the percentage of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have, for example, a grower could
have 1,000 PPFD on one section of their
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy and they can have 1,000 PPFD on
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can have two completely different
spectrums of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one is a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a white light to the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then another one could be that magenta
color that I think is more typical of what
[SPEAKER_02]: people think of when they think of LED
fixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light intensity, the PPFD could be the
same, but how that's being generated in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the spectrum could be completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: One might be 80% red and 20% blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's going to have an impact on the
plant development in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: allocation of the spectrum within that
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then watch just, like you said,
how much electricity you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really tell you how efficient
that light is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that process, as I understand it,
is your ballast is going to be generating
[SPEAKER_00]: some level of heat or putting off energy
in other forms other than photons,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really not what we want in most
cases, as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more efficient a light is,
the more of that electricity is being
[SPEAKER_00]: translated directly into photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a perfect world, you would have one
electron coming out of the wall off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grid and being transferred and converted
into one photon.
[SPEAKER_02]: One the quantum of electricity,
one the quantum of light, but that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have efficiency losses
along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those efficiency losses take shape in all
kinds of manners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some efficiencies are lost in heat through
thermal management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some losses are on the circuit board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have a matter of how a fixture is
designed to cool itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fixtures have active cooling systems
with fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fans require electricity to run,
so you're going to have efficiency losses
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, when you're
looking at efficiency, the goal is to have
[SPEAKER_02]: as high of efficiency as possible so that
you can reduce those losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me think another factor would
then be how uniform those photons are
[SPEAKER_00]: being sent to create a canopy or a stamp
down below the light fixture itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, unfortunately,
this is a podcast, so I don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: visuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start talking about uniformity,
a visual is really helpful for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what that would look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and this comes back to why I think
horticulture lighting has such a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: reputation in that you can see how
complicated this all can get, and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see how you can really play with
numbers and play with things to trick
[SPEAKER_02]: customers or consumers into thinking
they're getting something that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually not, where if you took a really
small, bright light fixture over,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, a four by four, and you were
able to get, let's say, 1,000 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you're going to be targeting that
over, say, one square foot right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your average across the canopy is
going to be the same as if you distributed
[SPEAKER_02]: that light nice and uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know a nice uniform canopy is
going to produce better results for a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give a little bit of a history
in terms of sort of where lighting is,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it started and sort of where we are
now in terms of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies like metal halides,
CMH, LED, HPS?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the history of lighting for growing
relatively corresponds to the history of
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you kind of look back at the history
of lighting, I think in a larger time
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, it's relatively new technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, incandescent light was really
formed around the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's scary is if you look at that,
I remember growing up, there was the same
[SPEAKER_02]: light bulbs that we used in our house
until pretty recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really inefficient technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you move to fluorescent lighting,
which is still very much used in the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing industry today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was developed in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, and these were all developed for
industrial applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: High pressure sodium in the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was designed for street lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal halide in the 60s, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Automotive, streets, industrial uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS has that orange glow to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal halide has that crisp, cool white
look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then LEDs started to come around in
the 60s as well in the visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: As semiconductors at large started to
proliferate and become more integrated in
[SPEAKER_02]: computers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so along that way, I think if you look
at the history of lighting in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all have to give a ton of
credit to the cannabis industry for
[SPEAKER_02]: helping advance that and really help set
some of the operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're using today, where given
the legislation of cannabis and how
[SPEAKER_02]: growers weren't able to plow a field and
put it out in the open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't able to build a greenhouse
that everybody could see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were forced into warehouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were forced into garages and closets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, there's no sunlight there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to rely on sole source lighting
and high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great technology for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was extremely bright, extremely high
performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The efficacy, the energy efficiency was
phenomenal at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluorescent fixtures were below one
micromole per joule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden high pressure
sodium was getting up to 1.7.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, high pressure sodium was the most
energy efficient, highest efficacy
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting system until just a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thinks that LEDs are just
intrinsically energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously over the last few years,
we've made tons of advancements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not even really close anymore,
but that's been a very recent development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of track the history of
general lighting to the history of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that most people
kind of ask, well, what's the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between a grow light and a regular light
that you would use in your house?
[SPEAKER_02]: And until recently with LEDs, the answer
was nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People would take the same HPS lamp that
was used in a street lamp or a parking
[SPEAKER_02]: garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd put it in a warehouse and they
could grow plants with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs now give us the flexibility to design
custom light intensities, custom spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's no longer taking something
that was built for a highway and then
[SPEAKER_02]: having to tailor all of your other
procedures around that light to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal, changing your irrigation,
your fertigation, your nutrient schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Optimizing your HVAC around something that
was never designed specifically for a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can take light and specifically
design it for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's no longer kind of that
limiting threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was first starting to grow,
the center of the industry standard was
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide for veg and HPS for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these so-called new technologies
would show up like LECs is something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a lot of these days that people are
recommending or using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And double-ended fixtures with HPS is a
relatively new idea as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch a little bit on what
some of the differences are between these
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit more detail for
listeners?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so LEC is a marketing term that
ceramic metal halide companies used as
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs started to become a little bit more
popular, which I think is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from their perspective, kind of smart,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had LEDs coming online,
which everybody associated LEDs with new
[SPEAKER_02]: and high tech and innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of other people associate them with
a lot of other words, right, as well in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of underperforming, high cost,
all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, LED was
associated with something kind of new and
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to associate ceramic metal halide
with the same, you know, they just started
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out with LEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where you get that name
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then double-ended HPS, from a growing
perspective, the advantage there is really
[SPEAKER_02]: all around energy efficiency and higher
performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you're moving from
single-ended to double-ended where it
[SPEAKER_02]: changed the cultivation technique quite a
bit, right, when you start to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiencies and you're able to get higher
light output.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went from hoods where the single-ended
might have been much closer to the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: to get a higher light intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had air cooled hoods, and then you
were able to move the double-ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: higher in the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could remove some of the different
HVAC requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed the landscape quite a bit when
they introduced double-ended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look at, you know,
why growers were typically using metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide for veg and HPS for bloom,
you know, that was based on, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to call it rudimentary
research, but research at the time that
[SPEAKER_02]: was really looking at spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a lot of people at the
time associated, you know, more blue
[SPEAKER_02]: content with a more compact plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And metal halide has more blue content
than HPS and then more red and far red
[SPEAKER_02]: content with flower development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where you started to see the
use of those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with more research and the ability to
fine-tune spectrum with LEDs, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the nanometer, we can do research
that we've never been able to do before to
[SPEAKER_02]: really look at, you know, how truthful is
it that that blue makes a more compact
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done research before where we've
actually grown cannabis under various
[SPEAKER_02]: spectra of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we ran one that was about five
different samples of different spectra of
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant that actually was veg that
had the longest inner node spacing,
[SPEAKER_02]: it stretched the most, was the plant that
was actually grown under blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you have to start to look at
this entourage effect of spectrum and how
[SPEAKER_02]: does blue light integrate with the other
spectrum of light to get what we see as a
[SPEAKER_02]: more compact plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just what we think of as more
blue light because you take blue light and
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate it and it does the opposite of
what you think it would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is sunlight still the king in this
arena?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear everyone say that nothing beats the
sun and I could see where if we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting technologies that are not
designed for agriculture, for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and just using them to grow plants,
that might be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without getting too far into different
spectrums, how does sunlight compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know your light, for example,
is a white light, you know, CMH or LEC,
[SPEAKER_00]: since they're the same thing, they're more
of a white light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of full spectrum or rather
than going with these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more orange-red colors or blue-green or
purple like the magenta color you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned with LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the comparison between all of this,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will try to be succinct in answering
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go too long, just stop me because
it's a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is really where we start
talking about spectrum and optimization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just getting started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only just, you know, we influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We as a species are just getting started
to really understand how plants use light
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we can use light as a tool to
elicit certain responses out of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, to answer your question,
is the sun still king?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, we've had customers
that have traditionally grown crops
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors or in a greenhouse using
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've moved to our systems and they say
it's the most flavorful crop they've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the sun does is, you know,
it provides everything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides every spectrum of light that a
plant could want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it is good and some of it is
harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you start looking at
ultraviolet light, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: ultraviolet has some very compelling
tendencies to elicit positive responses in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but it can also be very damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stresses the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're stressing a plant at a
time when you want to be maximizing its
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, that's going to be a negative
response that you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're providing far red light,
at the wrong time of the crop's
[SPEAKER_02]: development cycle, again, it could be
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what we really need to do is
take, you know, take the grower and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are your goals?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are you trying to
accomplish with this crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then take light and use that as a tool
to help them accomplish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a one size fits all approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with universities and we ran
research with the University of Tennessee
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at phytonutrients and looking at
different compounds and how can we take
[SPEAKER_02]: these critical compounds that can be used
in pharmacology that natively can only be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe 0.3% of a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the crop we were studying was
dill, looking at a compound to help people
[SPEAKER_02]: with vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it natively was, you know,
very small doses plant, but how could we
[SPEAKER_02]: use light?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we looked at various soil source
spectrums going from really looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between 400 nanometers and 405
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 420 nanometers, I mean, the
differences between these are
[SPEAKER_02]: incomprehensibly small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at the results of what
that does to a plant and how that affects
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemical compositions of these plants,
it's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most interesting thing that we saw was
that you can use light to increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical composition of the plant and
target those specific photoreceptors that
[SPEAKER_02]: are responsible for that development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And increase the percentage of that
compound, but it came at a cost of yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant's biomass overall was lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where I come back and I have
to say, what is your goal as a grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can use light to increase THC
content or CBD content, but is that going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come at a cost of overall yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as companies are moving more towards
extracts and they're starting to isolate
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds and identify really what
they're targeting, the answer might be yes
[SPEAKER_02]: or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, very early stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most fascinating thing is
right now we're creating these tools that
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to give researchers the ability
to conduct research that they've never
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to do before.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, when I joined Fluence three years
ago, we still had a lot of research
[SPEAKER_02]: partners in academia that were using
theatrical stage lighting filters over HPS
[SPEAKER_02]: to conduct this type of research,
which is not exactly as precise as you
[SPEAKER_02]: would like it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been a soil person and I've
always turned to soil as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: improving or affecting terpene expression,
the odors and flavors of my crop through
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating minerals or the biological
aspects of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I understand it, and from seeing
some of your research at Photo-X and other
[SPEAKER_00]: places, essentially lighting spectrum and
lighting intensity can have an effect as
[SPEAKER_00]: well on how a plant expresses not just its
growth, but also its different
[SPEAKER_00]: phytonutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might let the other Travis chime in
here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just kind of tee it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the role of lighting in
plants, there's really two main aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: that light impacts it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's in growth and one is in development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you kind of take a step back and
say, what is light?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Light has a duality nature to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an energy and it's a particle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you look at the energy of the
plant and its impact that it has on
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, that's really where intensity
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you look at the particle,
and that's really going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelength of light that goes back to the
spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants have hundreds of photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those photoreceptors are all
responsible for different things within
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might have a photoreceptor that's
designed to take in, say, 460 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_02]: 370 nanometers, whatever that might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's going to trigger that
plant to do something particular with that
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been fascinated with chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at chlorophyll A and B,
those are probably the two most popular
[SPEAKER_02]: pigments and photoreceptors in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're largely responsible for
photosynthesis and they both align with
[SPEAKER_02]: red and blue wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you see this uprising of
magenta and pink lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is when you solely isolate
those photoreceptors, you're neglecting
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of other photoreceptors that are
responsible for nutrition, flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: structural development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to your question,
looking at an internodal spacing of a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and everything else, you can
absolutely optimize that with light and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like you're a soil guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're asking, is the sun the best
source of light?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like looking at soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, if you went out and dug a
hole in some really rich fertile ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it wasn't, say, in Salinas Valley
or something, is that going to be the best
[SPEAKER_02]: soil for a plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or could you optimize it in a way to get a
better response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things about the sun,
as I understand it, is over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer, the sun spectrum changes
slightly and people have made the argument
[SPEAKER_00]: that a plant, for example, if we're
talking cannabis in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be post solstice as it starts to
flower and that lighting spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, in the sun is going towards
more of a red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the cannabis plant or all annual
flowering plants would be used to this
[SPEAKER_00]: slight slow change in spectrum that the
sunlight gives, that's our baseline for
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal and then they try and recreate
this with lighting technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any foundation or research to
support any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can chime in now, yeah, that's a good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting because you can
track the plant back to its native
[SPEAKER_01]: habitat, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to draw conclusions based on where it
originated to try to figure out how best
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it flower or do whatever you would
like it to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, there's other
environmental factors obviously at play
[SPEAKER_01]: aside from just light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some annual crops, you can trump
the photo period response for flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: with temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, like with garden mums,
they're also a short day crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they flower under short days and you
bulk them under long days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say that you're growing them in
a late summer and the days start to
[SPEAKER_01]: shorten and you would think flower
initiation would go on, but you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very hot late summer, that heat will delay
your flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter the light quality, no matter the
duration of the day, the temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically trumped your flower
initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same can go in relation to light
intensity and photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a short day, no matter the
spectrum, is supposed to trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, if you have excessive light
levels, but a short day, the light level
[SPEAKER_01]: could trump the response you're looking
for from a short day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's so many other ways to
come at it than just taking assumptions
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps on where it's native to,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought up a couple other
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I just want to highlight when you
say photo period, that's a new term that
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't talked about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the amount of time
that the plant is receiving light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll compliment on what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Travis said on some of the basic
terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you think about light,
he mentioned you have three things to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have duration, light quality,
the spectrum, and then intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about duration,
this is the amount of time that the light
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually in contact with the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of time the plant is exposed
to the light is a term called photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photo period is key in multiple
physiological processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the main ones specifically for
cannabis obviously is the vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, bulking, branching, and then
flowering growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, photo period is just duration of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brought up a couple other questions
that I've had for years and wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is optimal in terms of vegetative
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people, some people say that plants
need a dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear other people and I read an article
recently that showed the benefits of a 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any research on optimal
levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: I even saw a really crazy 13 hour
flowering chart or 14 hour, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember correctly, that someone set up or
where lighting's going on for two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and off for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: All ways of supposedly maximizing the
amount of light that a plant can take in
[SPEAKER_00]: over a given, I think it's a DLI,
daily lighting or what's the term exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: for the amount of light a plant can take
up over a given period of time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the amount of light
accumulated during a 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to go to your question,
is there a specific sweet spot for let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say vegetative growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can optimize your environment to be
working 24 hours a day, but it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the photo period and it's not just
due to light quality and light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these other environmental factors
such as CO2, humidity, soil and root
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, leaf temperature,
air flow, you know, transpiration rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, all of these are going to fall
into play in combination or even
[SPEAKER_01]: complementing your light levels in your
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fun thing I see coming from a
greenhouse background, now that we're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to focus in on controlled environments,
we have the ability to have precision over
[SPEAKER_01]: every single environmental factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we're going to find
multiple ways to achieve the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I said, with flowering,
temperature can manipulate flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes just as much as photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's many different ways to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in regard to just basic flowering
physiology, a long day for cannabis does
[SPEAKER_01]: help with bulking, getting you that
carbohydrate buildup in order to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, burst out flowers once it's
started flower initiation under short
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I think that's something not only
cannabis, but also controlled environments
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, flowering crops,
vegetables, we're going to find multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: ways with all of these environmental
attributes to get to similar goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and to add, if I could chime in on
this too, because I think what Travis is
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting on is, you know, kind of we're
moving into this kind of new world of crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production with controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at things from a business
standpoint, from a commercial standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you look at all the different ways
that you can do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, whether you're using
temperature to control stem elongation,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're using light, you know,
you really want to look at what's the most
[SPEAKER_02]: economical way to do that, which one is
going to have the lowest operating cost,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they both accomplish the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at if you look at
lighting, and you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the period of darkness,
and the spectrum of light, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, we're currently underway with a lot
of research looking at, can you achieve a
[SPEAKER_02]: DLI that is as far as we know,
say optimal for cannabis, they say you can
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve a 35 DLI for cannabis,
if you can achieve that in a eight hour
[SPEAKER_02]: period, versus a 12 hour period,
could you then have a longer dark cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: where maybe your HVAC isn't running as
hard, or maybe you're using peak grid
[SPEAKER_02]: energy less, so you're paying less for
that energy, while you're still
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishing the same yield that you
would otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where things are going
to be fascinating from a business
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, you start to optimize
operations and look at how we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: these, use these techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, when it comes to spectrum as
well, you know, there's a lot of research
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the phytochrome
photoequilibrium, and the red to far red
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio, and what impact that has on
flowering, can you trick a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the photo period isn't actually
controlled by the amount of day that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant receives, it's controlled by the
amount of darkness that it receives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can you actually, you know,
maybe run your lights and flower for 18
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, and trick your plant into thinking
that it had that long night cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you can maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where things will get quite
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you guys presented some far red
research last year at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch a little bit on how
some of these lighting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more unique lighting spectrums that are
more specialized, and some of the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that those are having on plant growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis, I don't know if you have anything
that you'd want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of anything that I
could share right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will say that before I worked with
Fluence, or started working at Fluence,
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with them on a project using
different red to far red ratios for
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering of multiple, you know,
perennial genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did learn is that,
you know, as Travis stated, each plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has, you know, within the understanding of
how plants take in light, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: something called the photoequilibrium,
and phytochrome, and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so certain photoreceptors,
you know, perceive a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths that trigger flowering or
trigger certain growth attributes that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I could just say anything on it
is, you know, the more precise we get on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these sole, you know, I guess you
could just say pigments that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying on the plants, we're going to
have just precise growth attributes that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be able to trigger during different
stages of production, if anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're learning that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, in regard to let say,
you know, leafy greens, and herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we could learn from this industry,
but they're they're using, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different, different light quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say red or blue light towards the
end of production to enhance certain
[SPEAKER_01]: phytonutrients, or even using UV,
like we stated before, to provoke certain
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that are desirable, but you
don't grow with that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole time during production,
you just apply it for a two hour period,
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, for the last week of
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that I know our research team is
working on some things in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, all the all these
industries are linked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we learn, they're all plants,
how can they how can we bring it all
[SPEAKER_01]: together at the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and I'll I'll build on that with
with specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the exactly what Travis just ended
with is we can learn a lot from different
[SPEAKER_02]: crops and apply those same techniques
across the across the different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but even within within the same
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at cannabis, we ran a UV
trial with three different strains of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and each one reacted
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, we were able to increase the THC
content with with UV light.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, it didn't really seem to have an
impact and one it had a detrimental
[SPEAKER_02]: impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from a, you know, going back from a
marketing perspective, right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluent sells UV lights, but you will not
see us advertising these as like a THC
[SPEAKER_02]: booster or anything like that,
because it depends on your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also depends on how you use that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we still have so much to learn
before we can start to advise on how to
[SPEAKER_02]: use some of these tailored tailored
spectra to elicit those specific results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, what I'm getting from this
is that these really specific spectrums
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a have an impact or a fairly
dramatic impact on the health and growth
[SPEAKER_00]: of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research just hasn't been
established enough to really make any
[SPEAKER_00]: broad assertions about about that sort of
thing at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about how some of these
studies are conducted, whether they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with with certain lighting
vendors or they're with the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you have, you know,
you have a study underway and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trialing a certain spectrum with the same
variety, but you have other set points,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said before, these other
environmental factors that in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: setting could be completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you learn something from
the study in regard to the light spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: you also need to trial different
conditions in regard to all of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions to make sure that
it could be a consistent result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there just basically hasn't been enough
replication of any of these studies to
[SPEAKER_00]: really draw any good conclusions,
because like you mentioned, there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many variables involved that it's just
really hard to know how how it will go or
[SPEAKER_00]: how plants will respond under slightly
different environmental conditions other
[SPEAKER_00]: than just the lighting spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think something that that
benefits growers is to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the horticulture space, what is called
grower trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where, let's say, a grower
would work with us and we could set up a
[SPEAKER_01]: trial specific to their environment their
needs, and then be able to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend something specifically for their
goal, because everyone else is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a completely different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we can tweak every single one
of these factors, that's how you truly
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you guys are doing that,
because I think that's really what's
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking right now in this industry is
we're seeing a lot of claims, but not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people doing controlled research so
they can we can actually start drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you guys are adding to
that overall body of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you brought up that I wanted to
kind of brought up a question in me was,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know, plant stress is not
necessarily always a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'll have that grower who
always had the crop that got neglected or
[SPEAKER_00]: got pests or something happened,
and it ends up being their highest
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, highest THC crop that
they've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in Italy, I read a really cool
article about how the farmers would flood
[SPEAKER_00]: their tomato fields with saltwater at a
certain period during that plant's growth
[SPEAKER_00]: as a way of stressing the plant,
creating, you know, forcing it to put its
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into its fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that tomato had, you know,
better flavor in it, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any ways or research around
lighting and plant stress in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization or ways that we can maybe
utilize lighting as a way of improving,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bud quality or flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll speak a little to this because I did
work with, you know, plant stress in
[SPEAKER_01]: general for part of my thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting, you know,
in regard to flowering or fruiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when a plant is under stress,
it's going to take whatever energy it has
[SPEAKER_01]: and just reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of like the last
resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to die, it might as well
just reproduce, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can induce flowering through
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stress, yes, can be through lighting,
can be, you know, either from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would believe, light quality and also
light intensity combined, you could have
[SPEAKER_01]: different stressors there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also have, you know,
certain responses that also have different
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, if you were to give a plant,
let's just say, an exposure of a harsh UV
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength, you could produce a certain
compound in the plant that attracts
[SPEAKER_01]: predator insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's been work done at
Kansas State in regard to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that you give a certain dose or high
intensity light pulse and you can provoke
[SPEAKER_01]: certain compounds in the root zone to be
resistant to pathogen, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: entrance into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know specifically, and Travis,
you may be able to speak to this better
[SPEAKER_01]: than me, but I think plant stress has a
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just on how do we approach it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Travis, did you want to add anything
else to that, other Travis?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I just piggyback off of what I
was saying around UV light, in that
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely you can use light as a
stressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, stress has its place in
terms of benefits for crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really, when it comes to light,
we don't know, and we can't prescribe when
[SPEAKER_02]: that optimal time will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, do we want to use it maybe
say during the scoto period at night and
[SPEAKER_02]: blast the plant with some UV light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we want to do it during the main
flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all the research projects that
need to take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's genetic specific, it's
environment specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've ran more trials than I can count
where unfortunately the data comes back
[SPEAKER_02]: inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we will be running a UV trial to
determine if we can use UV light to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the quality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then halfway through the study,
the grower will have an HVAC problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for three days of that cycle,
their temperature or their diff or their
[SPEAKER_02]: RH is completely out of sync.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the results come back and you say,
well, are those results accurate or was
[SPEAKER_02]: that a result of different environmental
conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, get cannabis flowering
alone is, you know, a couple months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to add in the time to
cure the plant, test the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so each of these trials takes a few
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about three or four months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have one thing, go out of
step, which typically do in a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: growing environment, you have to start all
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, the research process
takes quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited though to see where this
all takes us in terms of plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you are opening up the door too for
more pathogens, poor growth or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: less yield, depending on, like other
Travis mentioned, the types of stress or
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're towing this thin line
that you don't really know what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: set it off either one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never heard of being able to give
lighting spectrum and actually affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of a plant to attract certain
insects or repel other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to learn more about that as
you guys learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, hearing you talk about
this, it reminds me of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just looking at it as a stressor,
but as a beneficiary outside of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: growth or development.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a trial with the University of
Florida, basal bounty mildew is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the number one issue with basal crop
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll use different techniques to
help prevent it and keep it at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sulfur is one of the most
prominent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we actually looked at using different
spectra of light and concluded that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: use a specific red wavelength of light to
suppress basal bounty mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you start looking at using
light outside of just a tool for
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis or photomorphogenesis,
you start looking at it as a part of your
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you start to, you know, can start to
look at using light in a multitude of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys working with anyone that's
using it right now for suppression of
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew or botrytis with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we did prior work for chemifluents
using blue light in reference to making
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus spordulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in certain cases, some spectrums
actually enhance, you know, spore count in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain fungi, which is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we did work on using UVC to
kill botrytis on contact with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: hormic doses, just pulses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that research, if anything,
it's just now really starting to be part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the conversation in regard to
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear what you guys come up
with in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get back to some of these
questions I had written out before our
[SPEAKER_00]: talk that were sort of basic, but really
captured some of my questions from back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was that I always thought
that LEDs in general were too expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: and they seem to produce poor yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed more and more
improvements in the LED, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting arena and that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when it first came out,
I always said it was, it just wasn't there
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys feel like we're there yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just talk a little bit about where
we're at with LEDs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were too expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, unfortunately it's created
this negative impression for LED
[SPEAKER_02]: technology in the horticulture space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned, you know, earlier when I
was talking about my background,
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined Fluence, I left a Fortune 500
company where being in the marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: department at a Fortune 500 company,
it doesn't matter who your boss is or what
[SPEAKER_02]: your title was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You reported to the legal team,
you know, everything that you,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you put on paper, everything that you
said had to be run through legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there was even one iota of some
kind of claim, it had to be substantiated
[SPEAKER_02]: and proven, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we don't get sued.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the, in the horticulture lighting
space, there was nothing, there was none
[SPEAKER_02]: of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined and I did a competitive analysis
and I was appalled at the claims that
[SPEAKER_02]: these other lighting companies were making
that were completely unsubstantiated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they, we have competitors that would
just literally put like guaranteed higher
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, okay, well guaranteed or
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you give your light to somebody
that doesn't know the first thing about
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, how are you going to guarantee
better yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody I think was the
highest performing LED or the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: performing light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody would, you know, you'd have a
300 watt LED system that would outperform
[SPEAKER_02]: a thousand watt HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just, it was appalling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told my boss, Nick, the CEO of the
company, we'll never do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll never do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to build credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a different approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's been, it's been an uphill
battle, kind of going against the headwind
[SPEAKER_02]: that LED manufacturers created probably
going back to maybe five, five years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: or so where they would come in and they
would, the technology was not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The LEDs themselves were not efficient
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't powerful enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the packages and then the people that
were building these quote unquote go
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, a lot of them did not know the ins
and outs of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so nowhere on their labels,
would you see the PPF?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you see the efficacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you see par maps that would show you
the light uniformity that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you had buyers that were buying
things based off of claims and hearsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And marketing that was, that was false.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the industry has become much more
educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are, you know, lighting is
continuing to evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: The commercial horticulture industry is
continuing to evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're, you're seeing, I think more
respectful horticulture lighting companies
[SPEAKER_02]: come out that are trying to do things the
right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, the growing
community is becoming more educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is only putting pressure on lighting
companies to, to adapt to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're starting to see more standards
being, being implemented.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the DLC, the design light consortium,
who typically have helped to build
[SPEAKER_02]: standards and regulations in the
industrial space so that when you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy a light for your home, that you can
look on that box and it has all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: critical specifications listed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what you're buying there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be working in the
horticulture space and they'll be coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out with a specification that will help
bring, you know, more clarity to the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have these standards and,
and the lighting companies need to start
[SPEAKER_02]: playing by the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to be perfect when it
starts, you know, they're still going back
[SPEAKER_02]: to how much is unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there, there will be standards put in
place that may hinder growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you kind of look at the pace of
innovation in the automotive or the
[SPEAKER_02]: aerospace industry, it is slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's, it goes at about a snail's
pace because of all the regulations and
[SPEAKER_02]: standards that they have to conform to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on one hand, it's good because you have
a very high safety rating because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not just throwing in unproven components.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, you know, the adoption
of innovation is pretty slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think horticulture lighting has
been kind of unregulated, just running
[SPEAKER_02]: loose and wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's come at a detriment in the cost
to the growing community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting some kind of standards in place
will, will help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that answers your question in
terms of the history of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: about why we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to answer your question,
absolutely we're here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the costs are continuing to
go down as LEDs continue to proliferate
[SPEAKER_02]: and the underlying technology behind them
continues to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as, you know, companies like
Fluence start to become larger and we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, you know, the commodity of scale
only helps us reduce our pricing that we
[SPEAKER_02]: pass on to customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't really
acknowledge the, the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: for, for fueling that growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the food production industry
right now is, is they don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: margins that cannabis has.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the flexibility to take
risks and adopt new technology that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis has, because if they fail,
you know, that could be bankruptcy for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the cannabis industry,
you know, I think natively is risk takers.
[SPEAKER_02]: More entrepreneurs and they are helping to
adopt new ag tech that as those,
[SPEAKER_02]: as those technologies are proven,
as those companies scale and grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're able to reduce their pricing,
then the food industry can look at it and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, okay, that seems to be proven.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be working in, oh,
now the pricing is dropping because these
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies are being adopted on a more
wide scale, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ultimately if we can help the food
industry become more sustainable and more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient, everybody wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with everything you just
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that here in Washington and
Oregon, we're seeing such a, we're at a
[SPEAKER_00]: point now where so much cannabis has been
produced relative to what's being consumed
[SPEAKER_00]: or purchased that a lot of growers are
struggling and they're having a look to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at ways at improving efficiency,
not just from a lighting perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from an overall business perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where I think LEDs really shine
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still a higher cost of entry,
it appears, than say a double ended HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, correct me if I'm wrong,
seems to be the closest equivalent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-made LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you more than make that up in terms of
the amount of electricity and efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're getting out of the LED fixture
over the life of that fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I will not hide from the price
of our fixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you know, Fluent is very,
open about the pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't play games, we have standard
pricing and our fixtures on day one are
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely more expensive than
high-purchase sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The onus is on us as a company to make
sure that our customers can get a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: payback on these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are high-tech systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are new technology, high-tech
systems that cost more to build.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of people that go into the
research and the support behind them costs
[SPEAKER_02]: more to support these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the price is higher, but we look at
from a business standpoint, energy
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency and lowering your utility bill
are absolutely, you know, something to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at and consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: The maintenance cost is something to
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all secondary to helping our
customers improve revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, looking at can we help you
increase your yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we help you increase your quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we help you maintain a better shelf
life or consistency so that your
[SPEAKER_02]: forecasting is better so that your shrink
is reduced and you have less crop loss?
[SPEAKER_02]: We take in all of these factors and we
don't tell the customer, hey, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get 10% more yield, you're going to get
5% more yield, you're going to get 20%
[SPEAKER_02]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't tell them that they're going to
reduce their shrink, which hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis, he can talk about that as well
from his past experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't tell them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is we try to show them that
that is all possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we allow them to say,
you know what, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can get, you know, say 10% more light
or 20% more light and I can get these
[SPEAKER_02]: other factors, I can reduce my HVAC costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They plug it in the model and they do a
payback analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can't be efficient at providing
a payback within a timeframe that is
[SPEAKER_02]: suitable for our customers, then we need
to go back and we need to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you look at the adoption of
Fluence and if you just look at Fluence
[SPEAKER_02]: and the adoption of the cannabis industry,
both from home growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hobbyists at home that are using one light
to the world's largest growers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: using thousands of lights, it's clear that
it makes sense for everybody, large and
[SPEAKER_02]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was joking around when we first started
this podcast and I was interviewing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people that I know in the cannabis
industry that I consider to be influencers
[SPEAKER_00]: like my buddy, John Palmer, David Bernard
Perrone up at Teagod, Nelson Linsley with
[SPEAKER_00]: Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, like, guys, I don't want
this to turn into a Fluence podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: because we keep talking about their name
when we talk about lighting just because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what you guys are doing is very
innovative and you are doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research to support the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want, I don't want it to sound
like there aren't other companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting companies out there doing good,
good things too in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people just need to really do
their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've kind of given us some tools
here today with this terminology and
[SPEAKER_00]: other, other information in terms of how
to evaluate a light or a lighting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your eyes, what, what separates
Fluence from some of these other lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: companies out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll speak to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was on the other side,
so I guess you could consider me a buyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I did really appreciate
about Fluence, even though at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was trialing multiple other,
other lighting technologies, for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when it comes to a grower that's
making a large investment in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going through all of these decisions and
building a new, new controlled environment
[SPEAKER_01]: or greenhouse or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have somebody who can help you
from, from the start, not just in regard
[SPEAKER_01]: to lighting, but every other thing that
you need to think about in regard to
[SPEAKER_01]: photobiology and plant physiology,
Fluence was extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that side of it, I came to
respect Fluence and hence why I'm here as
[SPEAKER_01]: their Director of Cultivation Support now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care enough to have a whole division
that is meant to help the grower learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to maximize these technologies while at
the same time appreciating and also
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about all the other factors that
influence plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that's of high value with
Fluence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just piggyback on that and kind
of reiterate, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the intimacy with our customers
and in our research partners in parallel,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of having a vision that goes beyond
just having the best product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you look at our products in
terms of their specifications,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're world-class, they're great,
but that's, that's short-term,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to work with our customers,
understand the ins and outs of their
[SPEAKER_02]: business, what are their goals?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do they succeed and how can
we help them succeed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, keeps us focused on moving
forward and not being complacent and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just created a light that
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's, now let's sell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, customer success has been
from day one, our key focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what got me excited about your
company was the fact that I heard that a
[SPEAKER_00]: large commercial basil grower was using
your, using your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that someone outside of the
cannabis industry and that you guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with people in agriculture was
able to be profitable using, using your
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting technology, I think is,
is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see that with a lot of
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you're doing all this
research with, you know, Cornell and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other research universities that
are known for Ag is really what sold me on
[SPEAKER_00]: your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that, that, that's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all these plants are connected,
whether we're talking about basil,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, petunias, you know, a lot of,
a lot of what we learn from one can be
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we find value in learning from multiple
live goods industries, instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on one where, let's say in some
cases, it could be limited on what we
[SPEAKER_01]: learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I would, I'd be remiss if I
didn't talk about a study that we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now with Dr. Bruce Bugby at Utah
State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a leading plant physiologist and I
kind of talk about, you know, how much we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we define PAR going back to
the very beginning of our conversation is
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the study we're doing right now is to
debunk that we're actively looking to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: is this true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this knowledge that we are building on
true or is there room for improvement?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by, by working with the growers and
as the commercial horticulture industry
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly evolves due to disruptions in
technology and growing populations,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time, giving these researchers
tools to continue to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: give us the knowledge to make them more
efficient is going to be, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: radically changing how people grow plants
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't want to extend this podcast too
much longer because I've taken so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: your day already, but I did, I did have a
question in terms of, it made me think of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant myths, assisted with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the, like we talked a little bit
about optimal veg photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys didn't give me like an exact
general recommendation, but you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: explained why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering in terms of like those green
headlamps, do plants see that green light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always heard that they don't,
but does that have the potential to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the health of your crop if people are
using green lights to go in during a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would say there's not, I've not
heard of that being beneficial at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and to me there, there is
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That anything you could possibly be
disturbing the photo period by having any
[SPEAKER_01]: light on at all, depending on your other
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even though we say photo periods
triggered by far red or red, even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have some other light, if it's at a
certain intensity, you could still trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: a photo period response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, if you have a dark period,
you know, and like, like Travis said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of plants responses are
due to having the dark period as their
[SPEAKER_01]: photoreceptor key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly would not have any other
lights on during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you look at why people use
green lights, if they have to go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: room when the lights are off, that comes
from that misconception that plants don't
[SPEAKER_02]: use green light, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people choose green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the least disruptive,
but it's still, like Travis said,
[SPEAKER_02]: it still would have an impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially given the duration and
intensity that you go in there with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously I don't think people are
seeing any detriment when they go in there
[SPEAKER_02]: with their little headlamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to turn on high intensity
green lamps in there during the,
[SPEAKER_02]: during the photo period, you absolutely
would see an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just kind of made me wonder,
are there any other sort of like lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: myths or sort of established things in the
industry that you guys have found to just
[SPEAKER_00]: not be very accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would use this time to simply say
watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's not like photobiology
related, but using watts per square foot
[SPEAKER_02]: to try to determine, you know,
how much, how much light you needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what should we be using?
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other question that, that reminded me
of was when I first started looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, people were using the term lumens,
but that's not something you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned once in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you, can you touch on that real
quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Travis, I'll mention one thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there's many terms out there also
depending on where you are in the world on
[SPEAKER_01]: how you, how you refer to, to light in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's say in early in the
horticultural industry, they referred to
[SPEAKER_01]: light as foot candles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was based on what you could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you made your judgment based
on what you could visually see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've learned with LEDs is we
can't trust what we, what we see,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to trust in the technology now
because it surpassed our, our ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: just perceive exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these units of measure in some
ways are, I don't know if you could call
[SPEAKER_01]: them legacy units of measure, but we,
we've surpassed them with our
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now use PPFD and micro moles,
you know, as a common cohesive
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of, of light or light
specifically for biological processes and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all need to be on the same page
instead of terminology is what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying so that we can compare apples to
apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and making sure we're using the
right, the right terminology for the right
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So light is used for many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're trying to determine,
you know, what lighting is best for your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but you're using a human based
metrics for vision, things will be,
[SPEAKER_02]: will not go well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could just take, if you take a,
a ceramic metal halide fixture that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool white visual appeal to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take say our spectrum,
which has a very similar, similar look to
[SPEAKER_02]: the human eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you look at them on a,
on a, on a spectral radiometer in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: how plants perceive them, they're
dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just making sure that you're using
the right metrics based on the appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a really good point because
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do look very similar to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't always think about the fact
that there's a lot going on that I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess where I would kind of wanted to
finish up this podcast with and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: other Travis, I could, we could talk again
about some of your background in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have you back on to talk more
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know you're a wealth of knowledge
there, but where do you, where do you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: see the future of lighting headed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've touched on some of these
different things that are obviously that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not there yet on, but is there
anything else in terms of where we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going with lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, me and Travis have actually spoken
about this a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my understanding, especially after
coming to Fluence now is the next step
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, with light in general for
plant applications is to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of intelligent lighting
systems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so every single one of your factors
are all controlled together and
[SPEAKER_01]: cohesively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Travis, I'll let you elaborate more on
that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, you got,
you have to look at the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I look at it in two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of the immediate future, you know,
maybe within the next five years and then
[SPEAKER_02]: the quote unquote distant future,
you know, five, 15 years from now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will probably become much quicker
than any of us expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the immediate future,
it's definitely going to be about
[SPEAKER_02]: continued efficiencies in the,
in the platform, lower costs, increased
[SPEAKER_02]: performance, really fine tuning spectrum
as we unlock more research and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting the pieces of the puzzle built
for intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at, you know,
the internet of things and you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: connectivity and you look at big data,
you look at everything that we're doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: our personalized with computing and smart
homes and networking, bringing that into
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden to make things more efficient,
I think we'll be here relatively soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start to automate the
garden and you can start to bring a level
[SPEAKER_02]: of intelligence and sophistication to it
that we've never had before in our food
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so the other Travis and I were
talking about this a couple of weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially as it relates to his role,
which is, you know, the influence right
[SPEAKER_02]: now is taking very much an educational
approach, really trying to educate our
[SPEAKER_02]: customers on photo biology and
horticulture lighting and educating our
[SPEAKER_02]: customers across the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's Travis's job is to help out
with all these other factors outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting, but the interplay of lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think soon, you know, our role is
going to shift from, and I think academia
[SPEAKER_02]: and the industry at large will shift from
educating growers on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to, how to spec, but try this,
how to detect a nitrogen deficiency to how
[SPEAKER_02]: to manage a robot that does that,
how to program a system that can detect
[SPEAKER_02]: that and then maintain those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to see a whole shift and
lighting will definitely be a component of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: An integral component of that as more
intelligence is brought to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say thank you for taking
the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I really enjoyed this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot myself, even just chatting
with you guys about some of the some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the direction that lighting is heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you both Travis's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to do a follow-up podcast
if you're open to it on some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental controls around lighting and
how important they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that, if you're open to it.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to talking to you guys
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Travis Williams and Travis
Higginbotham, both with Fluence
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioengineering, manufacturers of LED
lighting for the horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their website is Fluence.Science,
or you can type Fluence lighting into
[SPEAKER_00]: Google and it will be the first link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluence is spelled F-L-U-E-N-C-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_00]: blog at www.kisorganics.com, as well as
links to the data and information we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed in this episode on the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
