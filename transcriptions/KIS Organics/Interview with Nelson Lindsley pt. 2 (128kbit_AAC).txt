[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to subscribe to the podcast
and leave us a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also sign up for our newsletters
on our website as it's the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out when new episodes of blog posts
come out as well as any discounts or
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of discounts, I've gotten a lot
of feedback from people who are wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: try out this style of cultivation,
but they live on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country or in areas where it's hard to
source many of these ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get people started,
I'm offering 50% off on a bag of our
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar or water-only soils for this month
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw one plant in your grow room and just
give it water and see how it compares to
[SPEAKER_01]: your current growing method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, at the end of the cycle,
just re-amend that soil and use it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, we see even better results the
second cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put the code LIVINGSOIL when checking
out on KissOrganics.com and let me know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the second part of our interview
with Nelson Linsley of Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson is a cannabis consultant down in
California who has some unique
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives on cultivation as well as a
vast amount of expertise regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pick up right where we left off last
episode and start talking about how he's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some massive yields in his garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's change topics then.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I wanted to talk to you
about then was you do a lot of consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I haven't mentioned yet in this
talk is the yields that you're getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard from David you were at 90 grams
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that translate to over four pounds
per light approximately?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever measure by light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing we've got to stop doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the standard that people know,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wouldn't be four pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to look at it per spider,
it was 3.25 pounds per spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really 3.25 pounds and a four by
four, a little bit less than a four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four because it was a custom tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were spilling out on the
perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even say that the canopy
measurements and yield measurements are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and be as transparent as possible
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the figure that we measured based
on the tray size at four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were definitely at that point
falling and toppling all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest I've seen with pure organics
is around 60 grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're obviously crushing it on yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to get into that a little
bit in terms of some of the methods that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we talked about this hybrid method.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've talked a little bit about
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you want to touch
on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking a really beat genetic and
trying to get high yields out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get high yields out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this genetic company up in
Washington called Exotic Genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten some funny plants from that
are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow totally crazy and they produce
extremely high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll have a plant next to it that is
a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is really learning the plant,
having a high quality cultivar that's bred
[SPEAKER_00]: for high yields because not all strains
are bred for high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get 90 grams per
square foot from a San Fernando Valley OG
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or a Girl Scout cookie or a Candy
Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gotten that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe anybody that says they
have because I know the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain strains where they've been
bred in a way to produce those high yields
[SPEAKER_00]: if the environment is dialed in for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, plants that can handle very high
light levels are going to explode,
[SPEAKER_00]: be explosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we can do with
the LED lighting is when you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you create that environment,
and you can just feed it photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the ceiling is yet,
but I don't think I've reached it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can do even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take a lot of credit for it
because I think the plant does most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work, to be honest with you, as long as
you give the plant the right stage to get
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gotten those yields with high
pressure sodium or LECs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got those yields with really
high PPFD LEDs, just to be clear on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the one run where that first
happened, because when I first started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing under LEDs, I was not getting
great yields, but I was doing things wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: and started making adjustments to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing was the vapor
pressure differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's a big key that people
miss, is that they run too low of a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are scared to run high humidity,
of course, because of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also test to see if a plant is
powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company out of Boston called
Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put this down for everybody,
if you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell a little device that you can
take some leaf sap or leaf tissue and it
[SPEAKER_00]: tests the DNA of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you if the plant has powdery
mildew in it, and it tells you if the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has the powdery mildew resistant
genome, if it has that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find plants that are powdery
mildew resistant, that don't have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew in them, that haven't been
expressed yet, then you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any problems running a higher
humidity in those first three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's got powdery
mildew in it, you're going to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew probably is going to
express itself if you start to crank it
[SPEAKER_00]: and do any stress to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also something important for people
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's technology out there to tell you
whether you have powdery mildew in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is a systemic issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key for that, and then running
lower fertilization levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some of this stuff I've covered,
because you're going to have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rates, and then gradually
ramping up the light and not going full
[SPEAKER_00]: tilt right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we have a grower that's been
using general hydroponics or advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, and they hear this talk and
they say, okay, I want to start
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioning over and considering
organics and considering getting off of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you recommend they would start
sourcing some of these mineral salts at a
[SPEAKER_01]: more affordable level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peters and Grow More are two companies
that make mineral salt blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can source and get bags of this
gnarly-looking blue powder that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid mineral salt formulation that can be
a basis for getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use the amended peat moss,
so I really use those mineral salts as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to give it what I think it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those high yields, I never went above
1.2 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it, just to be clear on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried ramping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I've seen is negative results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten the best results with a
lightly amended peat moss and with a Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: More and Peters blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say peat moss, you're going out
and getting sphagnum peat moss,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a bale of it then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, to be clear, it's sphagnum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was listening to you guys talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sunshine mix or sungrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some dolomite in it and some
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing you had kelp to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're a big kelp fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do add kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add a veganic worm casting, so I'm not
using any animal products in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had good results with that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have good results with
bone meal and other kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had better results not doing
that and using vegetable compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't have any issues with
animal by-products, but I understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: some people do, which is where this whole
veganic industry came out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an issue with it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it and I've gotten better
results with the hybrid blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
it and I think it's actually could be part
[SPEAKER_00]: of sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now, but I've just gotten the best
results using that type of amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp, some of the glacial rock dust as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of that and just keeping it
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give someone an idea of
what they could do if they wanted to start
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting with this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In silica, that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that you guys offer a potassium
silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potassium silicate thing is the same
no matter where you buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what's in Dynagro ProTech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all coming from one company.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the silica blast and all of that,
they're just adding water to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EggSil 16H, we carry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people carry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing unique about it,
but that is a good way to pick up silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fully organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I haven't done
enough research on, but where is silica
[SPEAKER_00]: sand?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go straight organic and
you don't want to use an ionic nutrient or
[SPEAKER_00]: the potassium silicate, how do you provide
silica to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you foliar feed that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another strategy that I use as well
is I like to foliar feed potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant seems to do very well and
respond very well to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interchanging that with the kelp foliar
spray as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a little bit outside of just
my knowledge in my head here, what I have
[SPEAKER_01]: offhand.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the silica, I know
diatomaceous earth is really high in
[SPEAKER_01]: silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned silica sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe those are in the form of silicon
dioxide, which takes a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_01]: to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this last trade show I was at,
I was asking some of these guys that do
[SPEAKER_01]: this and make the sand and the
diatomaceous earth how long it takes for
[SPEAKER_01]: the silica to become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't really give me an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found an answer to that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went back to the potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to vary based on how
much biological activity you have in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is fair to say that you can't just give
a number, but we could say that maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: available within a month to three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of timeline is what I was
looking for, just a general idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this isn't going to be available for
five years, it's probably not something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to use in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting decent silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica levels just from the various
combination of amendments that we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, silica has so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually attach a silica article to
this podcast so people can read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Silica, the Strange Medium
Element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It talks about all the benefits of silica
from drought stress to actually mitigating
[SPEAKER_01]: trace mineral excesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make that extra manganese or
copper unable to be taken up by the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what it does is it actually spreads it
more evenly through the leaf tissue so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have less toxicity effects from
the excess micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fan of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've been pushing the light levels to
see where the threshold is for strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time I'm spraying silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always seems to mitigate any kind of
light stress if it's gradually coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's gone full tilt, then there's not a
whole heck of a lot I can do to bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silica is something that I use in
conjunction with ramping up the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play around with dilution ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sometimes go 3X on the dosage just to
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any negative results yet by
going high on the silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say 3X, are you going off of the
rates that say they recommend with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dyna-Gro project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for people listening, if you do go
out and buy egg cell 16H, we do carry it
[SPEAKER_01]: on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to mix it, be sure to add
water to the container first before you
[SPEAKER_01]: pour the powder in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exothermic reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to burn through the bottom
of that bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear an aspirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to come in contact with
this material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix your own protect for a quarter
of the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really affordable way of using
silica in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if you're trying to scale your
garden, you shouldn't be scaling it with
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn all of those safety practices when
it comes to mixing your own fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: With mycorrhizal and other kinds of
bacteria, I don't know if all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria should be breathing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be taking safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have a couple of notes on that
as well, Tad, as far as how people should
[SPEAKER_00]: be blending their mediums, blending their
fertilizers, and being safe with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the pesticide industry, the label is
the law and they give you specific
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions, but there isn't really a lot
of instructions on people how people
[SPEAKER_00]: should be making their soils, making their
fertilizers, all those kinds of things on
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag or a bottle yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a culprit of having mixed soils
without wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: So am I.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel indestructible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think about that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've gotten older now, I start thinking
about how to take care of my body and what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm breathing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is important to wear a mask
just to keep the dust particles out of
[SPEAKER_01]: you, at the very least.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff we're using in organics
is not inherently dangerous per se,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't want to get it in your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just don't want to be blowing out
Shmegma for four days, which I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: have had happen where I'm like,
oh man, why did I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny story, we have a feed store at our
farm and we got dust mites, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like dust and you look really,
really close and you can see them moving
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came in on some feed and we had,
I kid you not, 55,000 pounds worth of feed
[SPEAKER_01]: in this container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know because I was counting as I had to
move it all out of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a night, I was up to like three in the
morning moving feed and move it back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the shipping container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in between that, what I did was I took
everything out and then I just blew the
[SPEAKER_01]: dust out and I wore a respirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I threw diatomaceous earth down
and then I blew that out again to help
[SPEAKER_01]: kill any dust particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't wear dust mites and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't wear goggles and my eyes were
bloodshot for like four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what did I do to myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to really think about what's in
the air around you when you're growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: just be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because looking back, I was like,
yeah, I should know better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I letting this get in my eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't diatomaceous earth also not
something you want to breathe in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I definitely had a respirator
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, it wasn't enough
precaution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes back to like, well,
that's a good thing to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good thing because we want
people to be safe in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should have good safety practices in
the garden because we want to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a lot of energy and we
don't want to be sick lugging plants
[SPEAKER_00]: around because we'll make more mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm not healthy in the garden,
usually the garden's a reflection of my
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my garden's healthy, I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm not healthy, my garden suffers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that reminded me of something I
wanted to mention earlier when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about protecting yourself from
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I do agree with you on that when
we're talking about mixing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we talk about getting in the
garden and using your hands and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into soil, there's studies that show that
there's bacteria in the soil that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: helps create and stimulate serotonin and
happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can actually help with depression
and problems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to get out there in my vegetable
garden and let my hands get dirty and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very meditative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm mixing my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're talking about is a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your mucus membranes are
protected, like your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, you gotta get your hands in
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting your hands in the
dirt, you're missing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because first of all, it just feels
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it's not, the only times
I've had issues with my hands in the dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: is when I've used, like with the cow
manure compost, because it had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: oil in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of ate away part of my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain things, like if you're
moving to the vegetable earthworm garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: castings and all that, I've never had that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was using specific types of
animal compost, there was definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of oil in it that was no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to, I'm not saying don't
put your hands in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to put your hands in the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that everyone on
this planet needs to be doing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just do a little research on when
you're mixing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're dealing with higher
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want people to get the
takeaway that all animal composts are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be clear, and I know you're not
saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a two to three year age fish
compost that I'm really pretty happy with,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part, with our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some great soils that were
from horse manure and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of cow manure,
like you mentioned, for a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really want to get into that
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's the only compost that
I've ever had an issue with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do use fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use fish compost as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking terrestrial animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not thinking about things from the
sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a problem with anything
from the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those kinds of things are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I'm probably going to have
to have you back on because I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: could talk to you for hours more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go, I know you wanted to talk
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's knock that one out because I think
you have a really unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to get that out there.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really bad pesticide
practices that have been going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gray and black market because it hasn't
been regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best place to find those practices
is if you just go on some of these forums
[SPEAKER_00]: and they give you these dilution ratios
that are out of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pesticides that are labeled for
ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why they've been
labeled for ornamental plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've done a considerable amount of
research on those pesticides and that
[SPEAKER_00]: those are pesticides that we shouldn't be
putting into our body for particular
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have a long-term effect on our
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have other kinds of effects on
our body that we just want to stay away
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of a back story.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother is a brain cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what kind of leads into this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my brother is a brain cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he was very, I guess he was like
three or four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: His brain cancer came on when he was six.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was three or four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this crazy seizure out in our
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they had just applied this
organophosphate, which most of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: now been banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had applied an organophosphate to all
the trees in our backyard because there
[SPEAKER_00]: had been some African beetle that was
destroying the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my brother had a crazy reaction from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a crazy seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without any study, and I don't we
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's more research coming out
about why we have cancer and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that's leaning towards it's a genetic
thing that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it necessarily
correlated with my brother's brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, my mother, bless her heart,
total environmentalist, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: went on a campaign against these
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing was she ended up
working with Cesar Chavez and was on her
[SPEAKER_00]: Waldo and all this other kind of stuff
because all of the migrant workers and
[SPEAKER_00]: that were picking all the grapes were
getting sprayed every day by
[SPEAKER_00]: organophosphates and getting very sick and
having really bad issues because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I look at that now and spending
all the time in the chemical pest pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control world and learning a little bit
about it, I look at that there is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of really bad practices with the
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organophosphates are primarily banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like one Divo Chlorvos,
which is in those hot shot pest strips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen those before,
but those you can still get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most all organophosphates have been
banned because the way that they absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain kinds of pesticides,
certain kind of reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want the ones that kind of
absorb into water because that will kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you live on toxic, if you live on a
healthy land, you're going to hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: frogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't hear the frogs, then you
should go get your water checked because
[SPEAKER_00]: there could be some kind of chemical in it
because frogs and amphibians, they breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: through their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to be the first thing
that dies if there's a pesticide problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I look at this, I look at it as
like a methodology and a practice issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I say this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tough conversation to navigate
because there's a lot of overzealous
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-pesticide, anti-chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to say is we should have
an open mind to some of the progress that
[SPEAKER_00]: science has made.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to agriculture and also
analyze the methodology and the practices
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being used and separate that from
the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's some, you know,
we one of the reasons why we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides is because we're monocropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocropping isn't really natural as it
is, but that's what we've figured out as
[SPEAKER_00]: of now and how to feed all these people
that have populated this earth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: population of the earth is expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you go monocropping
outdoors, and you've got still the UV of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun, it's helping you out here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got some other things that are
helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you bring that in, you're
monocropping indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets extremely challenging to control
pests and bad fungals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, and I'm not advocating
people go out and spray their plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more speaking towards the community of
people that are anti-chemical everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just implore them to really do
the due diligence and do the research on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's out there, where the progress is
now and where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's different kinds of
biological insecticides and biological
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides that are naturally produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chitin producing back or the chitinase
bacteria that then produces an enzyme that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used to actually destroy fungal
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a, that would be
considered a biological pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people get locked into a
language battle when they don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that anything that's used to kill a bug is
going to be called a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a buddy that was spraying
compost tea on trees to bring them back to
[SPEAKER_00]: health and to get rid of another beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he found that this worked and he got
shut down because what they said he was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing was applying a pesticide without an
ag license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that got labeled by the courts as a
pesticide and that's a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people don't understand is that
we've got to take the emotionality out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation and look at all the tools
that we have, do the scientific research
[SPEAKER_00]: on how those tools can be applied to
cannabis in a safe way without jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: into conclusions and without going crazy
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we might need some kind of
biological control or chemical control to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably produce some of these plants
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we get into a whole other topic where
we don't need pesticides if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modifying the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people freak out about genetically
modified food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's another buzzword that I
think has been misused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about, you know,
glyphosate or whatever it's called and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing all that in, but I would be
completely for splicing a powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene from a powdery resistant cannabis
plant and splicing it into a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that I've brought
that up to and they want to crucify me on
[SPEAKER_00]: a cross for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand why because now
we're not having to apply those chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: that are questionably safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just this whole thought
process that to me feels a little archaic
[SPEAKER_00]: from where we're at right now with the
tools that we have in our tool chest to
[SPEAKER_00]: create better crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what happens then is that
the public perception gets changed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then those processes get shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could be missing a solution by
pushing back on that without having a
[SPEAKER_00]: pragmatic and logical conversation about
it and a logical study about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think those studies should be
funded by the people that are against
[SPEAKER_00]: those groups because that's usually what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people that are anti-pesticide
that already have a bias and they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a study and it's going to lean
towards their theory or their hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the chemical companies
that are doing the study and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: more rigorous process of testing all of
it, but it's still coming from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people aren't going to trust them
because they don't trust them already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to trust the people
that have a bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to me, that whole process is
completely broken and we need to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it completely differently because I know
there's some really epic scientists out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing a lot of work so people can
get the minerals and nutrition that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need from their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're getting stymied by this
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that if we can de-charge
it a little bit, not to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not questioning it, not to the point
where we're not engaging with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to the point where we're really
looking into it, but understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reason why we have pesticides
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we had pesticides, we had
famines where people were starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people are like, all pesticides
are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they don't understand is that if
you eliminate the pesticide, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, and I know you've probably
talked about this a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still spraying stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it organic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that it doesn't have
pesticides on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that they can't use specific
pesticides and they can't use specific
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're having to spray it more
because from what I've seen and from what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned, they're having to do more
work and apply more chemicals to that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to keep the bugs from proliferating,
especially when they're monocropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two ways we can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're gonna continue to do this large
scale food cultivation that we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on this planet, we're gonna have
to figure out a better way of applying
[SPEAKER_00]: these chemicals or use biologicals that
are in some of these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things that we're giving in
our compost tea that we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: understand yet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting compost tea and it's like
solving problems, but the science isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: totally there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we talked about the soil biology
and it's like this world that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to tap into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need to do more research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be coming from the system,
quote unquote, the matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be working with them so that
can move out of the hippie folklore,
[SPEAKER_00]: move out of the esoteric and move into the
tangible, move into the practical and be
[SPEAKER_00]: used on a large scale level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to be looking at the pesticide
practice that are going on right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: identify which ones are really causing the
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do that without emotionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's my whole thought on it
because I think if we can do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can find better products and
better solutions if we're doing this large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale monocropping model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other solution is for local
communities to start growing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: food and doing that in a biodiverse
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's guys like Ron Finley in LA
that are gardening in the thoroughfare and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all kinds of work to feed their
local communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that's the best
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are accustomed to just getting what
they want when they want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how we turn that corner
yet to get people to be actually growing
[SPEAKER_00]: their own food and cultivating it maybe on
a local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's because then you
can have a biodiverse amount of crops
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they're all working together and
all this knowledge that we're learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fungal network and soil,
the bacteria network, all this
[SPEAKER_00]: communication can be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have that high quality food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be producing it there and probably
needing very little pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have, you know, these massive
outdoor cannabis plants in my backyard and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not needed to apply neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not needed to apply any kind of
fungal control or anything on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a biodiverse space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there'll be a bug here and there
at land on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I come the next morning and
there's a spiderweb in between the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches eating all the bugs that were
chowing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just don't get that in a
monocropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for monocropping, that has to be
coupled with some kind of chemical control
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can move out of monocropping,
then we can move away from some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical controls and we can use more of
these things that we're seeing that David
[SPEAKER_00]: talks a lot about with the biological
controls and things like that with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, predatorial insects,
which I think is really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I'm imploring the community to,
I love the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the passion, but you have to couple
that heart and that passion with knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't just read something on
Google and assume that it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pre-qualify it because if we
don't do that, we get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get lost and we have to understand
what's data and what's an agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we have to be able to parse
those two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not at all am I saying, go ahead,
spray pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all am I saying, don't go spray
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is that we need to have an
intelligence conversation about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's extremely upsetting to see how the
pesticide and the pest thing in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry right now, like all these guys on
social media, if they've got, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with some powdery mildew or if
they're dealing with some spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's afraid to be honest about it
because people will go after them like
[SPEAKER_00]: vultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're afraid to talk about what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the practices get hidden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start doing bad practices again,
they start spraying ornamental pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungal controls to keep their problems
a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a problem, I post it and I show
everybody and I said, look, I screwed the
[SPEAKER_00]: pooch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something went wrong here or this
plant isn't a great plant and I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't gotten any hate from doing
that, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten anybody to come back at
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm saying, look, let's be honest
about the issues we're having so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: work on solving together in an intelligent
way, but let's not pretend that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying pesticides anymore, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying I'm spraying pesticides
and I'm not saying they're spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, but I know a lot of people are
pretending that they're not spraying these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a perception and there's a
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can be honest about the
struggles we're having, I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: find a better solution faster without
poisoning people, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I feel very
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what you had to say there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't totally agree with everything you
had to say, which is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes this such an amazing
world to live on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I would say is one,
you are totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are spraying pesticides and there
is this fear that if they show anywhere on
[SPEAKER_01]: their social media or with other people
that their plants don't look perfect and
[SPEAKER_01]: all their buds aren't amazing,
that the perception of them as growers is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not good growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, that's crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people should be putting that
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my vegetable garden right now,
I have some plants that are doing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better than others and that's just always
the way it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to pesticides,
though, this is where I have to disagree a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, is I feel like I've been
burned too many times by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and by the pesticide industry to
where I don't feel like I can trust them
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right the other day, I was down at
Home Depot, well, I guess this was a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago now, looking at blueberry plants
and they had signs on them that said they
[SPEAKER_01]: had been sprayed with neocanoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how to pronounce that
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neonicotines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neonicotides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neonicotides, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that's known to kill
honeybees that are supposed to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberries that I'm supposed to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know the effects of all of
these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long-term, we talked about cancer a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned DDT in Rachel Carson's book,
Silent Spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why we don't have condors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say let's do the science,
I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, there's companies
that are going to take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have seen that with Guardian
Mite Spray in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a huge one on the organic side
because if you're an organic grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably given a sample at some
time and you probably spray it on your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not knowing what was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it outside of the cannabis
industry with Roundup or glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the research is coming out on
that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's a big issue that hasn't
totally been settled in terms of its
[SPEAKER_01]: effects on human development, on kids,
on pets, on people's sensitivities to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I almost feel, and I'm in the other
camp there where like, fool me once,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't trust you because all these
pesticides are coming from big,
[SPEAKER_01]: big ag or big companies like Scotts,
Monsanto, Bayer, Dow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I don't trust them with the
future of my seed production, the future
[SPEAKER_01]: of what pesticides I can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Roundup Ready crops have destroyed
India.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of farmers over there, they've been
completely burned into poverty because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're forced to buy seed every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a crop failure, they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just struggle so much with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think I was being clear
enough though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm 100% in agreement with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that goes back to the
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to how they're releasing
these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing, and whether those
chemicals should ever be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that problem is that they're
trying to find a quick fix for a long term
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does that do to the insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: The insects have a very short life cycle
and they evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have super insects,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a direct result of the
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad practice, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I interrupted you, so I apologize for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanna, what I'm saying is that
we don't know on the science end how much
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is a tool that we can use yet
because of how bad the practices have
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of targeting the scientific
research, is all I'm saying, and studying
[SPEAKER_00]: it, we're glomming it all together,
is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't demonize the word pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, demonize bad practices and using
some of these pesticides is what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for me, and I know it's happening
right now even in the 502 industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using Eagle 20, if you're using
Avid, if you're using these sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: products, to me, you're not a good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's probably gonna offend
some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope it challenges people too to
say, hey, I need to provide safe medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to provide safe food for people
that are consuming vegetables and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that there are good biological
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what David talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are botanical oils and
sprays that you can use safely in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't hate the word pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a reality of monocropping,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, pesticides is what saved the
human race in a lot of ways because we
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be able to have farmed on the
scale that we have and fed this many
[SPEAKER_01]: people without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the point I'm trying to
make is that it's not, and I think it also
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back to how little we actually know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't understand the butterfly effect
of all these actions yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're gonna manifest 100
years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was studying different pesticides,
one of the things with DDT that was so bad
[SPEAKER_00]: about it was that it had such a long
half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sprayed a crawlspace of a home
with DDT and you come back 30 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still no bugs down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's not probably a good idea to
be using something like that because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna affect things on a very long-term
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the, God, it's such a sticky
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with it too,
because it's so charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more like we need to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand more what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand the insect biology
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand the fungal biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to study how nature handles that,
and we need to learn on how to apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: at a more efficient rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might come down to chemically
extracting some biological, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then applying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be considered a pesticide,
and it could get to a point where things
[SPEAKER_00]: are so charged around the wording on all
of it that there's really safe solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming from the right place that
get thrown out, or they get banned or not
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because of the realm that they're in
without the full understanding of what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is and what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you'll have the answer for me
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know this, but I've used
spinosad before for controlling thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've looked into the process of how
spinosad was discovered and how it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any study showing that spinosad
is harmful to human beings?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've moved away from it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of the fact that it's made
by, I believe Bayer or Dow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't trust those companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to vote with my money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make economic decisions that
support my values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, those companies are not the
companies that I choose to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's two different conversations,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about those companies
internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, we have an our perception
of what they've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also know that when companies get
really, really big, they tend to do bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't see what the right hand
is doing or the left hand is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a business issue that we have in
this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these mega corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where then the consumer or the customer is
no longer the priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge epidemic that we have in our
system in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is that chemical now
is banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can't use it in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the data showing that why we can't
use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did that get taken off the list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because it came from that company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it because it's actually damaging to
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And has there been any long term research
on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the problem I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying that it's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if anybody knows it's
good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it has long term effect on our
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to see that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like the people that are
writing the regulations to have that data
[SPEAKER_00]: to make assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we really need as many tools in
the tool chest as we can when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in an indoor controlled
environmental space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because problems compound and go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's my little segment on the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just where's the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the information on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that are making these
decisions, what are those decisions based
[SPEAKER_00]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're based on public perception,
that's a problem to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That public perception might be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, Nietzsche has a
famous quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madness is uncommon in individuals,
but proliferates in crowds and masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure that we're not
stealing towards madness with all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we're steering
towards knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's something that's taken
off, they could say there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people are using on an
organic level that could be banned for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe that would change the
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would be like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's making decisions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the data behind it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the point of me wanting
to talk about this is we need to know why
[SPEAKER_00]: we shouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you make a good argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're that far off in terms
of our perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just slightly on other sides of
center there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have enough trust in the
research I would be given.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't feel that we know these
long-term effects well enough to really
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's going to happen two years from
now, five years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these things bioaccumulating in our
bodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my whole thing is I'm all for
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to know that I can trust that
data over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be coming not from these big
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just need to make intelligent
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do see what you're saying about
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perception is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just suggest that people look into
biological controls as a starting point
[SPEAKER_01]: for pesticides and things that have been
used for generations, like neem oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, that we know to be generally
safe compared to some of these newer
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have a choice anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the law is going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that industry is going to blossom at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the biological controls
is where we have to go to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to explore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to work with guys like David
who are doing that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make it as good as we can and be able
to do that in a controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to see a lot more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Nelson, I really appreciate you
coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely going to have to talk to you
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed our chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to maybe you,
me, David, and Jai and a few other people
[SPEAKER_01]: all sitting down in the same room one day
and just chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring a lot to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be sure to let everyone know
down in California about what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with your hybrid method and consulting and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
