[SPEAKER_00]: Something I was thinking about the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted this on social media I got a wide
variety of responses and I want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts about cannabis leaves
praying Are you familiar with what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about when I say that it's this
sort of 45 degree angle a Leaf angle that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get and this has always been
associated with a very happy plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're getting good Turgidity in
the stem apparently What are your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on this because one of the thoughts I was
had was I was in my room looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the plants were getting way too
much light at the time and They weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly happy in my opinion,
but yet they were doing this praying
[SPEAKER_00]: motion I'm like, this is this is a less
than optimal angle for for receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: photons too versus, you know I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Forgetting the term is but to me
that would be because there's not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow and so what the plant is doing is
it's trying to raise up or expose more so
[SPEAKER_01]: the the bottom surface of the leaf to get
those stomata exposed and get more airflow
[SPEAKER_01]: and Eliminate some of that the the
humidity that's sticking right around the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomata and so Yeah, I would think that
it's caused by not enough airflow going
[SPEAKER_01]: through the facility or in another way I
think about is the the VPD isn't high
[SPEAKER_01]: enough either too much humidity or you
know, what what happens Have you but
[SPEAKER_01]: basically the plants not transpiring
enough it wants to raise the leaves expose
[SPEAKER_01]: the stomata more So to the airflow to help
drive a higher transpiration gradient
