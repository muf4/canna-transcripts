[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Dr. Daniella
Vergara.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an evolutionary biologist,
data analyst, educator, scientific writer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and public speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to her multiple publications,
she founded and directs a non-profit
[SPEAKER_02]: organization, the Agricultural Genomics
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: AGAF aims to make hemp and cannabinoid
science available to a broad public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Vergara recently joined the Harvest
New York Extension team from Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: University as an emerging crop specialist
to help hemp farms with their crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Vergara's scientific publications
include the comparison of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: by the federally produced cannabis to that
produced by the private market.
[SPEAKER_02]: These results were featured in news
platforms such as the Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_02]: Science, and FiveThirtyEight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, she published a comparison
between the genome of these federally
[SPEAKER_02]: produced varieties to the genome of the
varieties found in the private markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of her other scientific publications
are a compilation of the existing genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: tools available for cannabis research that
was featured in Science and the maternally
[SPEAKER_02]: inherited genomes, chloroplasts and
microchondria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vergara has authored these publications
along with collaborators from the private
[SPEAKER_02]: sector in the cannabis industry as well as
academics from several institutions
[SPEAKER_02]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through AGAF, Vergara educates the public
about science, data and analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: statistics, evolutionary biology,
and genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Daniela.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Kaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm excited that we're getting the
opportunity to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we start off by giving listeners
a little bit of your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I am in Cornell University in the
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the emerging crop specialist and I am
working with hemp and crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a lecturer at the University of
Colorado in Boulder where I was for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years as a researcher and I still have
some ongoing research projects at CU
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about
what that role is exactly as an emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: crop specialist.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's your day-to-day look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: My day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very flexible, but I have to go to
meet a bunch of people in New York state
[SPEAKER_00]: that are related to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, growers that are growing
cannabis for multiple purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's for cannabinoids or for fiber
or for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of people growing for
grain, for example, but that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I hope changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also figuring out how to help the
industry thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are processors or I had a
great meeting last Thursday or Friday with
[SPEAKER_00]: this company that they're doing biochar
and they're doing vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're now trying to do it with
hemp and how to figure out how to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis, quote unquote,
waste from the waste growers into their
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and make possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing cannabis for
cannabinoids, your stocks could be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have these massive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you gonna get that stock into
tiny little chunks?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of equipment you need in order
for there to go to this machine that is
[SPEAKER_00]: called a kiln machine that makes the
vinegar and the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were thinking about those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a better use for all the biomass that's
produced during cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because right now hemp for fiber
is getting a lot of traction and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that want to get hemp for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order for you to make a t-shirt,
you need a facility that it's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and it's a multimillion dollar
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you establish that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then farmers are not gonna start
growing hemp for fiber if they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a buyer, but the buyer is not here because
no one is producing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like, how do you break
that chicken and egg situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for grain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's people that are interested
in grain, but not a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get that started?
[SPEAKER_02]: So your role is to sort of support the
entire industry and make connections for
[SPEAKER_02]: folks as a way of sort of building it
within the state, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I haven't really talked about your
role exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking more about your
background in genetics, which we'll get to
[SPEAKER_02]: here in a second, but I was curious to
learn just a bit more about exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Establish connections and then put two
plus two together and figure out how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, with this company,
it's like, okay, really what we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is a transportation company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need trucks to go from one place to
another and then is that profitable,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking out all of those waste and leave
you're in one side of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: which for me, New York state is a new
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved here recently, but if you're in
one of the corners of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, in New York city,
does that make sense to take all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste to let's say, Buffalo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So figuring those things out, but
basically that is my role right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now your background though is wildly
different with your background in
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently listened to one of your
webinars and do you wanna just plug the
[SPEAKER_02]: webinar series really quickly before we
talk about your webinar so folks can learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I talked about in the webinar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can you talk just really quickly
about what the series is that Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: offers for folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was able to listen to this for free
to your webinar, but there's other ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that you guys put on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one particularly was between the
USDA and Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a collaboration and it was a
webinar regarding cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were people talking about the
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people talking about how you
process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked about the genetics part,
but yeah, there were multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was every other Wednesday for
four months, the spring semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were multiple talks in
multiple different subjects regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the videos are all now available on
YouTube, I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: On YouTube, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks can check those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a link in the podcast if people
wanna go back and see what was offered
[SPEAKER_02]: there from Cornell and the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make all the webinars,
but I was able to attend yours where you
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about cannabis genetics and some of
your research that you've done around
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
that research and what your findings were?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been doing that for eight
years, so there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple podcast contents that we
can have regarding all of my findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so what I did and what I
continue to do with the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado in Boulder is looking at the
genome, the entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically more genomics than
genetics, because genetics is more looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at particular genes, but genomics you look
at the entire genome and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the genome is composed of multiple
different parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, for example, the repetitive
contents of the genome, which people call
[SPEAKER_00]: the junk DNA, which it's repetitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bunch of things that look
alike and are found scattered throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a paper trying to describe the
repetitive contents of the genome that was
[SPEAKER_00]: published, I think that was 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the cannabinoid genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a work in the cannabinoid
genes as well, and looking at how these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid genes have different copies,
the different varieties, different strains
[SPEAKER_00]: vary in the number of copies of
cannabinoid genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I did as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also characterizing where do these
different varieties fall, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all, I don't know, blue dreams related
to all blue dreams and all of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Girl Scout cookies related
to Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that that's not necessarily
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some, for example, Durban
poisons, the ones that we sequenced,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sequence a genome, you take all
of the letters of the DNA and you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribe them and then you compare them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you compare, for example, yours and
your daughter's and you see how similar
[SPEAKER_00]: they are and then you compare it to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna find that yours and your
daughter's are much more similar than
[SPEAKER_00]: either of you are to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found, for example, that strains
that are named Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may not be related at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you a question about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you talk about cookies,
I think of a very distinct morphological
[SPEAKER_02]: plant structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can look at a plant and say,
okay, that probably has some cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics in it or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys look at that by chance or
were you strictly looking at the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: code?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were strictly looking at the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how were you determining whether
or not a plant fell into, was being
[SPEAKER_02]: classified as Girl Scout cookies,
for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you going just strictly off of how
the name was listed or known publicly
[SPEAKER_02]: based on how people were describing it,
either the breeder or the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the grower, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would tell us what is it,
that's Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would fit with sort of what I think a
lot of people think anecdotally is that
[SPEAKER_02]: these names, these cultivars are not
necessarily what we thought they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your findings on that was essentially
that just because something was named Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scout cookies didn't actually mean that it
was related to other things named Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you able to determine exactly what
was truly, in this case, that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar Girl Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have like a known one that you
could work backwards from, I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had multiple Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that these Girl Scout
cookies could be related to something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one in particular that was
related to a strain, Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had two strains, Jack Herrera,
that were not related to each other as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my take home message,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people ask me about it,
what I tell them is, look, go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, get whatever it is that works
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's named Girl Scout cookies or
whether that's named Penn doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it works for you for whatever it is
that you're using it, whether it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping or especially for medical
patients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're doing it recreationally,
I mean, I hope that you have fun with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is that you've got the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're for medical patients,
then go back to that same dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's called again, Girl Scout
cookies or Penn, get it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you go to another dispensary,
try to ask for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use it, but chances are that you're
not gonna get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances are pretty big that you're not
gonna get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you and I can see each other right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize listeners of the podcast
don't know, you're actually holding up a
[SPEAKER_02]: marking pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you're referencing Penn is
the other name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I would take it a step
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder, so if you go to the same,
let's say you go to dispensary and get
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't that Girl Scout cookies from a
different farm at the same dispensary give
[SPEAKER_02]: you entirely different effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to take that even one step
further, couldn't that same Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie plant that was grown in another
facility, exact same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even the cultivar within the same
facility, if it's grown differently,
[SPEAKER_02]: under different environmental conditions,
whether that's nutrients, media,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the farm changes something,
if they have changes in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they change their lighting,
couldn't that also affect your expression,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid expression, to where as a
medical patient, you're not gonna get a
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it becomes really daunting to
really know what's out there at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to somewhere,
any physical characteristic is a product
[SPEAKER_00]: of genes and environment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nature and nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some physical characteristics
that are more environmentally determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others that are more genetically
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, weight is a characteristic
that is very environmentally determined,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you eat, weight can
change or not, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yield in this case too, if we're
talking about cannabis, is more- Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't entirely know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabinoids, there is a big
genetic component to cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that, but we don't know how much
of the cannabinoid phenotype is genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much is environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there is a genetic component
and we know that if your parents- So for
[SPEAKER_00]: example, there's this paper from 2014 by
Nora Volkov, the head of NIDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that paper despite its name,
its name is something like the harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they never really talk about the
harmful effects of cannabis, but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a really good figure that shows how THC
amounts have increased through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes us think that breeders and
growers have used those individuals that
[SPEAKER_00]: have the most THC to be the parents of
next generation offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes us think that cannabis is,
that THC is a heritable component in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in humans, for example, height is
extremely heritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're tall, it's likely that your kids
are gonna be tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something like 80% heritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 20% is environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't eat the right food,
especially when you were growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna achieve that amount of
height that you could have if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten the right diet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cannabinoids, we think it's
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the potential of producing a
bunch of cannabinoids depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, but you could achieve it depending
on whether you have the right soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light is super important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know that there is a genetic
component, but it all depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we were talking about another crop
that wasn't cannabis, something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: understood genetically very well,
like corn or some other major crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat, whatever that may be, could you
give us more definitively an idea of how
[SPEAKER_02]: much is heritable in terms of
characteristics versus how much is
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question really is,
is the issue the fact that there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity in cannabis and we don't really
know that much about it or is the issue
[SPEAKER_02]: just plants in general when it comes to
understanding genetics like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's cannabis for multiple
reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis has been illegal for so
long, because cannabis has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated in a very scientific manner,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With corn, for example, we know that there
are particular cultivars that are for
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a genetic component to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, we know that in cannabis there
is a genetic component to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to cultivate for
cannabinoids, for THC or CBD, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use a fiber cultivar,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for example, the word cultivar means
individuals that have been cultivated for
[SPEAKER_00]: particular reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we are there in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see it in, at least in the
cannabis industry for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, for marijuana, you can see that
these names do not mean much and the names
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the casativa hybrid, they do not
mean much either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why for medical patients,
that's what I recommend, go to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, get the same thing,
because you know that hopefully it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the same grower, that it's going to
be using the same soil or cocoa or the
[SPEAKER_00]: same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it's going to be the same
variety, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a mother or the daughter
of that mother plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're expecting it to be consistent,
at least with that same dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it was explained to me, the term
cultivar is really the best term to use
[SPEAKER_02]: for what we're talking about with
cannabis, you know, sort of what people
[SPEAKER_02]: are calling strains because it's really a
cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is how cultivar was described to me
by my botany professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my mnemonic for how I remember that
it's not really a varietal, it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated varietal, so it's a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but then you're expecting it to have
particular phenotypic characteristics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're expecting it to have,
for example, I don't know if the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter is blah and the height is blah
and the cannabis production is blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know exactly what you're getting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually talk about dogs because
people, you know, people care about dogs
[SPEAKER_00]: and people, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about a chihuahua,
you are, and I tell you chihuahua,
[SPEAKER_00]: you close your eyes and you picture a
chihuahua, you do not picture a
[SPEAKER_00]: rothweiler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have been bred for these
particular conditions, which we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: have in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we do find looking at
the genome is that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the word on the street is right,
that for example, ChemDoc number one and
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemDoc number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one was the first seed that
popped or the first one, and then ChemDoc
[SPEAKER_00]: number four was the fourth one,
but they are siblings, and yet they have
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have full sibs that are entirely
different from each other, and that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is a lot of variation that is
out there, and that when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses, you don't know what to expect
when you are crossing a female and a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's why it's so
popular to have mother plants and to do
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning, because then that way you are
having more consistency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the breeding has not been done
enough in breeding for multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find when you talk to people in
the industry, it's like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's four generations in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, no, you need several
generations to assure that there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be homozygosity, which means that the
gene coming from mom and the gene coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from dad are going to be the same,
that they're going to be homozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need multiple generations of
in-breeding that has not been done,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20, at least eight or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a bunch of different things
when you cross two individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: a tall plant, a short plant, high
cannabinoids or cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to be a cultivar, it needs to
have a consistent expression, is
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't part of the challenge then for
breeders, the fact that the general
[SPEAKER_02]: population, its consumers are constantly
changing what they want, chasing these
[SPEAKER_02]: what people call hype strains,
this idea that there's always something
[SPEAKER_02]: better around the corner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's the cool thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's always something new and
always something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you do phenohunting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that comes with a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost is the lack of consistency
and the lack of, if you have a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of space and you cross these two
plants, this female and this male,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you reversed this female and you're
crossing them and they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are that there could be awesome
kids and not that awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have some offspring that are not
that cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have a limited amount of
space, you have to choose which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be planting, which seeds
you're gonna be popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you didn't pop that one seed
that was the coolest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so consistency brings consistency
when you have in breeding, then you are
[SPEAKER_00]: assuring that all of your individuals are
gonna be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring up the challenges around
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, genetics and testing have allowed
shortcuts in this process, some of which
[SPEAKER_02]: are more controversial than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I could at a very relatively young
age, know the gender of my plant or get an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of what the phenotypic expression
might be, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: From testing, if we look at the genetic
sample, and this is not talking about gene
[SPEAKER_02]: editing at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: What tools are there out there to growers
that are not, I guess, gene editing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think that we're in gene
editing yet, although- It's coming though,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for every crop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the strawberries that you had this
morning in your cereal, yeah, for rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, sex determination, sex expression in
cannabis is another big kind of worms
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can sex reverse them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you put, I don't know,
colloidal silver or silver nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can produce flowers from the opposite
sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Ethopan in males, they can produce
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there's an X and a Y
chromosome, like cannabis has an X and a Y
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do think that the X and the Y
chromosomes in cannabis are very important
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also think that there may be other
genes somewhere else related to sex
[SPEAKER_00]: expression because even if you are an XX
and they put silver nitrate, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce flowers of the opposite sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're not lacking a Y,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's multiple companies out there
that they have feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take a female, they stress it or
put colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female produces male flowers and then
they use that pollen to either
[SPEAKER_00]: self-fertilize that female or to fertilize
another female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're assuring that there's no Y
chromosome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have that, sometimes you
can even produce male flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's likely that the genes related to
sex are found somewhere else in the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not necessarily the X and the Y
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I started talking about
sex, but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gender identification at earlier stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to flower a plant out to
determine it's gender necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you have a Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tests that tell you yes,
you do have a Y chromosome or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't tell you whether that
individual when stressed out is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce flowers of the opposite sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell you or if that individual
is a munitions, it doesn't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does tell you whether it has a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also tests related to cannabinoid
production and whether your plant is prone
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce cannabinoids or THC,
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are some tests available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any available right now that can
give us an idea of terpene expression?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that's become much more important,
I think, to cultivators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know the genetic markers for
pining or limonene or any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different terpenes that you're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are a big, yeah, another big
kind of word because it seems like with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, there is something that we call
called pleiotropy and epistasis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are interacting to produce the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that there could be one
gene that affects multiple traits or that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one trait that is affected by
multiple genes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just this causes this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a more complicated picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a paper that I really,
really like by Jordan Zager and he's from
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State, actually, in Pullman and
his advisor, Mark Lange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are proposing that there is this
network of genes, which I think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do more of mathematical models and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that that depict not only
that terpenes, but also the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this complex network of genes that
are acting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm working on a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although I'm using only nine
individuals total because for those nine
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, we have the entire genome
placed together and we have the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to count the genes and to
look for the location of the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is that, well,
yeah, there are multiple genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabinoid productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, there's this one
individual cannatonic and this individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannatonic has truncated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an incomplete CBD gene and also an
incomplete THC gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it produces a CBD gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that suggests, right, like this is not
a definitive answer, but it suggests that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are multiple other genes that are
affecting the production of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the canonical THC and the
canonical CBD, there's other multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are affecting the production of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had Jordan on the podcast to
talk about his paper around powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: and a marker that they had found.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks could check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, from what you're saying, it sounds
like there's there's quite a bit we just
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't figured out about the cannabis
genome and how it's expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the future holds in
terms of research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's so many things, so many
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of what I said about sex,
right, like where are the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: related to sex determination?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of what I said about cannabinoids,
right, like are these genes interacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these genes related to the
expression when you grow them in good
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions or in bad conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do the expressions differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then or terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, when do you express certain
traits, for example, in terpenes or in
[SPEAKER_00]: sex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When when would you express like we know
that if we put colloidal silver or silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, then it expresses the male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am applying that colloidal server in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is the advantage for you to be
producing flowers of the opposite sex?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I think that there's so many
questions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, for example, we do not have
an assembly is when you take the genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, when you have all of the genome,
all of the DNA getters and you transcribe
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you have to chop them into little
pieces and then you have to put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have assemblies that are pretty
complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're lacking the white
chromosome and we're lacking the amnesia
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still need to complete those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and beyond for terpenes, right,
some terpenes are produced when under
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, if you're being eaten by a
caterpillar, then you produce a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when are these terpenes produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the same variety, do you
produce different terpenes and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, all of all of that part,
like the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of work to do in the
phenotype, like and then you put the the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype and that's even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put expression and that's
even you can add more and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see us eventually understanding
cannabis as well as we understand a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: like corn, or is it just too much genetic
diversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're chasing so many different,
I guess, medical, therapeutic or
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational outcomes, with this
particular plant, that we'll never get the
[SPEAKER_02]: stability to really get the that would
then further lead to the research that
[SPEAKER_02]: would allow us to like completely
understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have enough tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have genetic tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have smart people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think so that that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that much faster than it happened
to many other crops because we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been done for other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like taking what has been
done in rice or in tomatoes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: applying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the thing in cannabis is that
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that they're going to make
money right now, like, OK, like this is it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to make money tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And science is slow and breeding is low
and breeding differs depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you have in Oregon may not work
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you have there in Washington,
where you are, may not work here or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not work in Colorado.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a cultivator, we see genetics plays a,
you know, a significantly heritable role
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to disease, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, particularly disease,
you know, will have with an outdoor crop
[SPEAKER_02]: or even with an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are certain environmental
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll always have certain plants that
will thrive and certain plants that will
[SPEAKER_02]: suffer because most growers I know are
running, you know, 20, 30, sometimes 40
[SPEAKER_02]: different cultivars or more varietals,
whatever you want to call them in their in
[SPEAKER_02]: their facility or in their field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do see that certain, you know,
certain plants will suffer more than
[SPEAKER_02]: others and certain plants will thrive in
the exact same environmental condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know genetics plays, you know,
a fairly large role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't know exactly how large,
but pretty large.
[SPEAKER_02]: What interests me, I think, is figuring
out how if we took particular genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: how we maximize the genetic potential of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we took, you know, whatever you
mentioned, you know, chem dog number four,
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out exactly how that plant likes to
be grown, that we could cater our
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our nutrients are our media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our environment to really optimize
whatever particular cannabinoid expression
[SPEAKER_02]: or terpene expression that we that we
really want from the plant like that to me
[SPEAKER_02]: is is really the most interesting because
right now as a grower, I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create conditions that are optimal for
most of my plants to at least achieve a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount of yield or a certain
expression that I know that the general
[SPEAKER_02]: public or the medical community is going
to want to purchase.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we take that a step
further to where we really dial it in by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eventually a cultivar,
let's say a varietal.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that process look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a complicated question,
but I do think that if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have the environment is
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've seen, for example,
I have a friend in in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he does is that he has his set
conditions and this is the light regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the nutrient regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this variety does well here,
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he doesn't adequate the nutrients and
the conditions to the variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are only certain strains that he
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think it's pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like he already has this this
figured out like, OK, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he brings varieties or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that is pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing outdoors,
then it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's then that is where where where
things get complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you were saying, there is a
bunch of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a there's a bunch of things that
can happen.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is is one of them, for example,
that you can control indoors much more
[SPEAKER_00]: than outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you need to figure out which ones
are those individuals are resistant and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that means that you need to do
some sort of inbreeding, because if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing those and then again,
what we were talking about there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a bunch of different things
and height differences and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's can we talk a little bit about
phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had written an author paper called
Widely Assumed Phenotypic Associations in
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Sativa Lack a Shared Genetic
Basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just touch on sort of what your
findings were with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a nice paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give a shout out to Ben
Holmes from Centennial Seeds and Front
[SPEAKER_00]: Range Biosciences, because he made that
possible and he's a known breeder in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measured a bunch of different
physical characteristics of phenotypes in
[SPEAKER_00]: these individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a cross between a hemp type and
marijuana type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measured a bunch of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured a bunch of different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, height, pedial length,
leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three different cannabinoids and
we found that they are not correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot correlate the leaf shape
with percent THC or you cannot correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: height with leaf shape or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are completely not correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people in the industry that
can say, for example, oh, this smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, lemon or this smells
like pine and therefore it was tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: had broad leaves, which it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I say it in how I explain it to
people is that you cannot you cannot say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you're tall because you have blue
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those traits are completely not correlated
or you have brown eyes and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: you're blonde.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those things are completely not
correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the industry, for example,
those things, oh, it's a broad leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore it's this type of strain and
therefore it's this grouping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid or is an indica or is an
ativa that doesn't that is completely not
[SPEAKER_00]: related whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have individuals that have broad
leaves and have high THC or individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: that have narrow leaf and have high THC or
individuals that are tall and have high
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or individuals that are short and have
high THC that is completely not correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything from the physical
characteristics of a plant that correlated
[SPEAKER_02]: with the medicinal therapeutic side,
the cannabinoid terpene, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that side of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we do see correlations between the
cannabinoids, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids are very all of these
genes are acting in unison.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these genes, right, they have the
same precursor molecule, which is CBGA,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBGA, the mother cannabinoid,
they all of these different enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA synthase, CBDA synthase, CBCA
synthase, they act on the same precursor
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see correlations between the
cannabinoids, which is expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not at all between height or video
length or leaf shape or nothing.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, interesting.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't really know what to what to
add to that, other than that they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't look at a plant physically and
have any idea what's going on internally
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of what it's going to produce is
essentially what you found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these physical traits, you have to
measure them, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to measure the THC, the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do breeding, you can have
all narrow leaves with all of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could be narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them could have like this really
thin narrow leaves and all of them can
[SPEAKER_00]: vary in the amount of THC that they
produce.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so I have been asked before
these questions like, OK, you found that
[SPEAKER_00]: there I had this other paper with the
leafy with the people from leafy with
[SPEAKER_00]: where we looked also at the sativa indica
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that sativa indica hybrid has
no correlation with the cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes that the plant produces.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we also know that the genetics,
right, that the genome does not correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: with the indica sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that what we were talking
earlier, that you can have a strain named
[SPEAKER_00]: broscot cookies and another strain named
broscot cookies that are not related at
[SPEAKER_00]: all whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when when people ask me like,
OK, so what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it means that if you have a
high times best strain that was this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, this purple haze or
whatever, this tangerine dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: then change the name and next year just
call it pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also be the high time strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names do not mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names do not mean anything when it comes
to the plant.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market it again and then call it something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is my advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's unfortunate because I think some
of the the oral histories around some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants is is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I'm trying to dive
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: In another podcast right now, unrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not scientific at all,
but I think the stories behind these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that all gets lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we move towards people, you know,
just renaming things and everything just
[SPEAKER_02]: being jumbled and we don't really know
what's what out there in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately, but that's a that's another
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that we're going to know
unless we sequence our genomes and unless
[SPEAKER_00]: we create kind of like this either genetic
barcode or these phenotypic barcode.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and that's why I think that
testing facilities and reliable testing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities are really important because
you go there and you know that this has
[SPEAKER_00]: however much mercy and CBD and CBD and
terpenoline and et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can create kind of like this
phenotypic barcode for your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you sequence it, then you can
create this genomic barcode for your
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that these names and,
you know, so and so was in this concert in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1991 and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how this that's that's just an
anecdote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally an act.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's some of the stories are
interesting, you know, purely as anecdotal
[SPEAKER_02]: stories, you know, entertainment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing you brought up was the labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a whole nother issue is
lab reliability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in certain states, as emerging
states came into play, the labs that gave
[SPEAKER_02]: the highest THC percentages were the ones
that then survived and people would use
[SPEAKER_02]: because they, you know, the cultivators
could market and sell their product for
[SPEAKER_02]: more or the labs that were passing people
on heavy metals were the ones that that
[SPEAKER_02]: people used because, you know,
it's it's so it becomes all economic at a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where it becomes really
hard to use any of that data for science,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there is so much variability,
even on the lab side, I would argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree and I disagree with what you just
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree because I know that that happens
and I can tell you which ones to go to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Boulder, Denver area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, however, this paper that I
was talking about with the people from
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafley, Nick Giacomas and and Christiana
Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a paper that was actually
published this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between a Christiana, myself, Brian
Keegan, who's a professor at CU Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and I have this is our second paper
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nick Giacomas, so the four of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is that we analyzed all of
the strains from Leafley, all of the chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at cannabinoids,
we looked at terpenes, we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations between cannabinoids and
terpenes, between terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so this is Indica or this Sativa,
this is hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we did this beautiful statistical
analysis and machine learning analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the figures are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the figures because I did the
figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that people like the figures
because it took me a long time to do those
[SPEAKER_00]: figures to make them really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the paper, Leafley works with six
different labs across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lab in Washington State,
Oregon, I think California, Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's labs in multiple different
parts of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we measured was how
different the labs were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the labs were very consistent between
them, despite one of them being in Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other one in Michigan and the
other one in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was and I was very positively
surprised because despite the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry being so differently regulated
everywhere, despite cannabis being still
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal, you have these labs
that are very consistent and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these people that are doing wonderful
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I like I want to
congratulate these people because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They and they are putting out very
reliable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you still have those labs,
which, as you just mentioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like so-and-so will spike your THC or
so-and-so will, you know, will give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: pass on heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also I think that we should
congratulate Leafley because Leafley now
[SPEAKER_00]: knows they have really high standards and
they're really good at vetting who they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work with, which was in a way my
take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Leafley knows who they're working
with and Leafley knows consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are possibilities out there as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: These weren't six randomized labs then.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were labs that were vetted and are
using the same SOPs, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vetted by Leafley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they were using the same
SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they did have different
equipment, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's not like everyone had
Agilent or everyone had Shimatsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but they were labs that were vetted by
Leafley and Leafley just chooses those
[SPEAKER_00]: labs in order to gather their data.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I got to figure there's
good labs out there, just like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: good cultivators that are following the
rules and there's other ones that are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, spraying illegal pesticides or
plant growth hormones or things that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, are not safe for humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that's human nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think labs have potential, but I think
we have to acknowledge that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges with lab testing as much as
there is with genetics and diversity and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going on with trying to better
understand this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's good restaurants and bad
restaurants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, was there anything else that you
wanted to share regarding, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the research you've done or anything that
you're really excited about in the
[SPEAKER_02]: upcoming year related to the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know when this podcast is going
to be published, but I also worked on the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties produced by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a paper on 2017 regarding the
phenotype where we compared the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids of varieties or strains that
you can find in dispensaries to those that
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced by NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on 2021, we have the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the genome from NIDA's
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be giving a talk at the end
of August regarding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the take home message is that,
you know, NIDA varieties are not
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of what people are using,
neither in the phenotype nor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like NIDA's varieties are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because NIDA has this monopoly where
they are the only ones that produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that is used for medicinal or
research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal research or any sort of
scientific research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NIDA's varieties are different from
everything that people actually consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be talking about that at
the end of August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the plants that NIDA is using are
used for, do they influence national
[SPEAKER_02]: policy or are they primarily just what
they're supplying to the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: community?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does influence policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work if their plants that
they have are so genetically different
[SPEAKER_02]: than what everyone else is consuming and
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this just typical government
bureaucracy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how could that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How could that research be not biased,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how could you have research that is
reliable when you are producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for research and your weed is
completely different from everyone else's,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is your research reliable?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those differences then out of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_02]: The main differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In respect to cannabinoids, they have very
little variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diversity of cannabinoids is much
less, so less diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of cannabinoids is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less THC, less CBD, more CBN,
more of the breakdown compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBN is actually significantly more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then regarding the genome,
which was the 2021 paper, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: different from everything else,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you, you can study dogs,
but you can only study labradors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about the chihuahuas or French
poodles or great Danes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only study this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely different from what
everyone else is consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the implications of really
high CBN relative to what is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBN is a breakdown product,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBN accumulates usually when you have
a lot of heat, when you leave your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in for a long time, long periods
of time, it accumulates and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually that cannabinoid that gives you
the headaches or usually that it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like makes you drowsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the cannabinoid that NIDA has a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets expressed, you said,
from heat stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a breakdown product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC turns into CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an oxidation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC turns into CBN and you know,
like something else that I think that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the cannabis industry,
at least in the legal markets is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people really put a lot of effort in
producing really good weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in marketing themselves as,
you know, like mines are the stinkiest or
[SPEAKER_00]: yours are the prettiest or mines are the
tallest or yours are purple, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this competition in making the
best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to differentiate myself and
my brand and making the best weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have NIDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing the cannabis for research,
which is not the best, not diverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: not potent with a lot of breakdown
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that's what scientists have to
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know a lot about the medical
chemical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never just that hasn't been my area
of interest as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see the CBN thing is interesting to
me though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you see that still existing in the
general market and just much lower levels
[SPEAKER_02]: of plant expression?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when I go to a dispensary,
for example, I'm not going to necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: when that plant gets oxidized,
I'm not going to get a headache because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get as much the same
levels of CBN that I would from a say a
[SPEAKER_02]: NIDA plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you leave, if you buy flour
and you leave that nog in your in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garage, the entire summer and then,
you know, come October, you take that nog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's likely that the THC would have
converted into CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like I said, that's not something
I've ever looked into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure there's a lot of listeners
that know exactly what you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but hopefully there's some like me that
are learning something right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it took a little bit to get on this
call together with our schedules,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for sharing some of your
research and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we can stay in touch and talk
again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you learned something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
