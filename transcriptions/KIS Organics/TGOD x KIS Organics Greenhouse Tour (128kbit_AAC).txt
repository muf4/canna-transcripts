[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone, my name is Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the marketing manager for core
cannabis at the Green Organic Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to welcome you to this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really grateful to the kiss organics
team for co hosting this with us as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as for your time and letting us show you
through our organic greenhouse that it
[SPEAKER_00]: really means a lot to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of housekeeping items before
I throw it over to Tad and David.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, all of your microphones are muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean you can't ask us
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a question box you'll see at the
top right of your screen or your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that, you can post your
question and we really encourage you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the guys are really excited to take
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is we ask for your
patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have done all of the work to try to
make sure that the Internet is working
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly through our greenhouse,
but sometimes we do have some connectivity
[SPEAKER_00]: issues as we move from room to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask for your patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This usually only takes a couple of
seconds to get back up and running,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we thank you in advance for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're really excited to get
started and I'm going to send it over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad now for a proper introduction and
thank you Tad for again joining us on this
[SPEAKER_00]: tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're really excited to have you
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like she said, I am the owner of kiss
organics and the host of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really excited to do this tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been wanting to see this facility for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: David is an old friend who I met at Canon
Con many years back when he was working
[SPEAKER_06]: over at Whistler Medical, and that's when
we first started talking about this
[SPEAKER_06]: concept of living soils in commercial
facilities and really scaling it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the largest scale facility out
there as far as I'm aware of, and
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly the only one I know that's
certified organic, so really excited to
[SPEAKER_06]: tour it and see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: David has a long background in
agriculture, working and getting his
[SPEAKER_06]: degree at McGill.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been working in legal cannabis in
Canada now for quite a few years and has
[SPEAKER_06]: been working with Teagod as their head
grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited to turn this tour
over to David and get this thing kicked
[SPEAKER_06]: off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, awesome to finally be able to
show you
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that we already can have touch
on too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for everybody for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that mentioned, coming from an ag
background like had a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working in legal cannabis for
over seven years in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not so long, but it's still a long
time thing that's changed so much and so
[SPEAKER_02]: much progress, so much exciting project.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our second one we're doing here
since we've been exchanging with you that
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah, looking forward to show you all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right now we're in the gunning
area just before we go into the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're what we call their support
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're harvest, drying, processing,
packaging, shipping and receiving all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every employees come into facility
through this hallway and we have to change
[SPEAKER_02]: both for a reason of idea and also
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different cross-meditation and other
stuff on the cannabis and that's more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive and also for patients and users.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so so David, this is a dual
purpose concept in the fact that not only
[SPEAKER_06]: is this regulated, but it also allows you
to get out of your street clothes and
[SPEAKER_06]: reduce the amount of pests and potential
pathogens that are coming into the
[SPEAKER_06]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we changed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking that from the floor and put that in
some rooms and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The increase of hemp production and
outdoor cannabis to back east cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really present on outdoors growth
and indoor growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the first line of the
facts we have to make sure we're dragging
[SPEAKER_01]: the least amount possible of stuff by
changing completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a cleaning service that comes
for several tracks for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And send them back and explode from the
idea and bring a purpose, but also for
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance with Health Canada,
which is licensing us to produce legal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Canada for medical and
recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the products in the channel are the
same, but to whom we sell at the end will
[SPEAKER_02]: be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for medical patient, we will ship
directly to their personal address and for
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational, we will ship to retail,
provincial boards and across Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we have a lot of stuff going on
and out today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also have a harvest going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running some moisture equipment will
be able to show you a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great David.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a request on the Q&A that you
speak a little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit more background noise,
so just for future questions if you could.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try and do that, but let's go ahead and
move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome and bear with us with a little bit
of connection issues, but keep reminding
[SPEAKER_02]: me of that please and I'll do my best to
repeat or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can take our time for the tour
today, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure that everybody is getting all
the information and you that they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great, so now we're just heading down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe to the mother room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone should be able to hear us OK
and we have talked to David about speaking
[SPEAKER_06]: a little louder, so you guys should all be
hearing that you may need to turn off the
[SPEAKER_06]: speakers on your.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your computer or your phone just slightly,
because there is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: background noise so we will do our best
here and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the main hallway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several different things that are
happening here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to remind you guys, we will get
some freezing on the video as we move from
[SPEAKER_06]: room to room, so we just have to be
patient for the Wi-Fi to reconnect there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK guys, I think I think we should be good
for Wi-Fi now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wait for your confirmation plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are now in the mother room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh David, there was a there was a quick
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone asked if there was that was a UV
light on the wall that we walked past.
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it, but when we were in the
hallway, do you know what they're
[SPEAKER_06]: referencing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think those one are just little
regular flying catching lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily UV, but you get the same
light in restaurants and kitchens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to attract a little box that may
add them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a good general sanitation
program on the processing side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: building.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not necessarily for a specific
candidate's idea, but it's just good
[SPEAKER_02]: sanitation practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, the connection here is OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there somewhere else in the room where
it might be slightly better if you move?
[SPEAKER_06]: Over or no?
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys think that this is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in this week, but we'll do
our best with that and we'll move to
[SPEAKER_02]: different rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets to be chubby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every rooms are designed the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This room is a bit more quieter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the others are also a bit smaller
because it's our mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: So David, how many different cultivars do
you have approximately in your mother
[SPEAKER_06]: room?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 days were not flowering them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about eight that we are flowering
and under rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's others that were set flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff that we used to grow and we
just keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: One or two plants for either breathing or
for bringing it back later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now I think we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: great, and then you mentioned you
mentioned the amount of soil that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are you managing the soil in your
mother room for these mothers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much the same thing as we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing it safe right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're learning out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only been growing this green out
since last October, so it's not been fully
[SPEAKER_02]: here yet, so we're learning still,
but so far at this time of the year for a
[SPEAKER_02]: year, it's been very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of good room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of time even in all that's
been older and tough grants several
[SPEAKER_02]: several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the mother room so far,
we're going to keep on our ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 46 months we kept up from longer and
we replaced them, but we kept a few of the
[SPEAKER_02]: older mom or a few months that got really
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally cut it down completely to see
how it would regrow and it's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: growing back very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even some of the moms that we remove
and I'll know to give you an example here
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to look down at this old.
[SPEAKER_02]: There used to be a smaller mother there
and now the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root of this mother that's a bit older
there are colonizing the old.
[SPEAKER_02]: This crop could be good for a three to
four mothers when there's just one of
[SPEAKER_02]: their dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of turnover of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only thing that we really have to
do with our soil in here is top it up
[SPEAKER_02]: because it kind of shrinks with all the
microdeletivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now we have a cloud that went
above the green out of the last sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think the setup level that we see
in there, so they just went off and went
[SPEAKER_02]: back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so David, how about this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because the connection in this room
is not quite as good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we move on to the next room and then
possibly I wanted to ask you some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: other questions in the the people have in
the other room where we might have a
[SPEAKER_06]: little better connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, we're going to go for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get muted just so I walk
through the hallway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a bit noisy and I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So while David's muted here, for those of
you, if you can still hear me,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to mention what he was saying
there regarding the lighting was when the
[SPEAKER_06]: cloud came over, then the lights come on
to add supplemental light to maintain the
[SPEAKER_06]: power levels at optimal levels for the
plants that they've set so they can
[SPEAKER_06]: control all that with the greenhouse
lighting, which is which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I happen to just know that they're
using Fluence lighting in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who the manufacturer is on
those rolling benches, but David can
[SPEAKER_06]: answer that when we get to the other room
as well as the greenhouse manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't you tackle those two
questions and we get there David and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: go from there cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we usually get the cell phone or
good Wi-Fi coverage in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just just be really loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll try to be a.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really good on the floor in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants got flipped into flower about
five days ago or roughly a week ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the lights look on on a bit of a
cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a forecasting thunderstorm here
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clouds get pretty dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we're almost getting into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think that a light setting for the
life we're taking on right now and you
[SPEAKER_02]: were right that those are like points by
the dinnering light working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a big part of it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really often work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a saddled amounts of existing
structure and brain of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two lights side by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a custom product that we get
along with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same way that we did love those
benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in the greenhouse business for over
50 years in the Netherlands, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the greenhouse manufacturer itself is
Kubo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this greenhouse is very unique in the
amount of technologies and data points
[SPEAKER_02]: that you get on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also it's just a general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Design place so we have a fully sealed
greenhouse here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So typical greenhouse, but you guys are
going to see easily together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's events on top or events on the
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in this kind of like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose and rose and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear movement from the top
and from the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: This basically a warehouse with a glass
roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot open the sides of the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a giant APEC system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are at some point, but those are
giant APEC systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember how many tons of APEC,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works and that's the most amazing one
of these rising, but like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google and Adima and for chat about all
the stuff company that the first real
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse over 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never failed to greenhouse like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told them kind of semi closed,
but I'm fully closed one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one and it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the greenhouse industry,
generally in the summer you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply some products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reduce the amount of heat in your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of different products out
there, so basically block the infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: light coming to your greenhouse and reduce
the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also bring some light this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I called up the other customers
just before they came to spring to
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we could get away without it
and we said we're done through the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity goes for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Ontario, we're just sort of
Niagara for people who don't exactly know
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are between Toronto and Niagara
by Lake Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very hot and humid summer,
but we were able to get away without
[SPEAKER_02]: having to reduce the light level in the
greenhouse just using the cooling
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I called up the helicopter half an
hour before they came, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an amazing light level in Reno.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a camera with Casey, one of our
climate control guys working with Reno.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we're at about 27 degrees in
Reno, 28 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other very interesting thing about
this greenhouse that is that the weight of
[SPEAKER_02]: the air and other resources that work were
living through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to show you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the air gets sucked in from the back of
the greenhouse there, either from outside
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it gets conditioned, proper
relative humidity, temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the water needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to pull it,
screw the canopy from underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have those big inflated balloons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them slurps because it's the name
that the Dutch guys are using for them,
[SPEAKER_02]: which basically they're appropriated big
lines and they pull air from underneath
[SPEAKER_02]: the polar through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really manage the microclimate
inside of our canopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So David, is the reason for the bed shape
because of this unique airflow system that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're trying to do to get the air in
coming up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the canopy from the bottom up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it reaches the design of a
larger bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go with a 14 bed with the amount of
refrigeration, the amount of water,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get the middle of the bed, which would
be the two feet in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get so much water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just getting a lot of mold and some
mud and a lot of times a bit taller from
[SPEAKER_02]: the larger,
[SPEAKER_02]: from managing the climate, the IPMs that
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the connection's a little bit choppy,
so I just want to make sure I understood
[SPEAKER_06]: that correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're running this shape and depth and
size of beds because it allows for the
[SPEAKER_06]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows you to work in between the rows
and manage the beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also limits mold and mildew pockets
that you may experience in a wider bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that all correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to ask how you just showed
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just show the inside here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that the leaves are kind of
rustling in there in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this was a solid piece here and there,
we'd only get airflow in the side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bed, then we would have a microclimate
that would form in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hard to manage for ICM and
also... And then, David, I want to ask you
[SPEAKER_06]: about CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you running in these rooms and
how are you managing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's dry as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to proper up a lot of
CO2 for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit of a fine-tuning process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go from anywhere from ambient,
where ambient CO2 level is a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: higher than normal because of resource,
where ambient is roughly 550.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how much we recirculate,
otherwise we can go all the way to 1,500
[SPEAKER_02]: BPM of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting at those levels, they're
depending on the air, and if you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: more recirculation mode of the air,
because if you're flushing the air all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, it's a lot of CO2, huge volume in
this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting part of the CO2 is that it
gets ejected into those serves that are
[SPEAKER_02]: below the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we deliver it through the canopy as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to finish on the air movement
system here, once the air goes through the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy with enriched CO2 in it,
there's two things that can happen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We either can recirculate it, so we get
the same thing as a fully closed indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, so we can recirculate the air in
the room, or we can exhaust it through our
[SPEAKER_02]: giant exhaust line in there, and there's a
bunch of charcoal filter in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we don't really smell anything outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can be a fully sealed, green-out
garden, or we can exhaust by forcing air
[SPEAKER_02]: through the canopy and get rid of humidity
or ice temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's something critical happening,
we can have an air-to-cold air exchange in
[SPEAKER_02]: the greenhouse every five minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to highlight a couple things,
because like I said, the sound is a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit off.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, Taylor Kirk asked about the
helicopter comment, and basically what you
[SPEAKER_06]: were saying there was you have a
helicopter that would come in right before
[SPEAKER_06]: the hottest times of the year to spray a
coating over the top of the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I understood you correctly,
to reduce the amount of heat in the
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse, and you called it off because
this year you were able to manage it
[SPEAKER_06]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through your air conditioning and airflow
in that system, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: In green-outs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually we use the helicopter because the
green-outs are too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like an extra and a half of
green-outs here on their glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my first jobs when I was a kid was
to paint a green-out with like a repeater,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I really liked the helicopter now,
it's a much better solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just basically a coating of
commercially available product that will
[SPEAKER_02]: let the good photosynthetic active range
of the light go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will bounce back more infrared light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You reduce the amount of infrared that
will warm up the green-out, but you reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: from about 50 to 30 percent your natural
light, depending on how thick you make
[SPEAKER_02]: that paint on your green-out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well thanks David.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to go back, I'm trying to get
as many of these questions in as I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our good friend Jaya Palmer was asking if
that was a bean plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was asking if that was a bean plant we
saw in the mother room, and what's the
[SPEAKER_06]: purpose?
[SPEAKER_06]: Another person asked if that was for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just touch on that really quickly?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one of them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a very happy-looking one,
but we put those plants in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're a little indicator plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So spider mites will go on those bush bean
plants first, and they are actually if we
[SPEAKER_02]: see spider mites on those, we know that we
need to increase the amount of beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insects that we have to grow to manage an
outbreak of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider mites so far, we've never seen them
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been really good for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's just a bit of an indicator
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, bush bean plants have been
growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the yellow tape I assume is
yellow sticky tape.
[SPEAKER_06]: To catch flying insects and pests in the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mass trapping, that makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just trying to catch me if you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not so much as a scouting tool
because you're not changing them out
[SPEAKER_06]: frequently, but I assume you're doing
separate scouting then on a regular basis,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, moving on.
[SPEAKER_06]: William was asking, how often does the
soil need to be changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that's fair too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't change
[SPEAKER_02]: our, we have the ability to change it when
we can up our cement behind the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this way we can really, if ever there's
a soil that needs, if ever there's a root
[SPEAKER_02]: that needs, we have the ability to change
it, change the soil, change part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have the ability to change the soil
if you need to, because those are
[SPEAKER_06]: manageable sized containers on that row.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the plan is to never change the
soil unless you absolutely have to,
[SPEAKER_06]: but rather to manage the soil fertility
through adding in various amendments,
[SPEAKER_06]: organic matter over time as the soil is
going to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ability to improve through improving
the soil ecology is essentially what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely perfect, but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show you another thing,
while we have our feature, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to show you this existing system that we
have to bring out that's pretty high-end.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time we tried it was really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can basically turn this entire room
into a cloud of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do transplanting, or if you want to add
a community level,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really cool feature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ben asked, how are you dehumidifying by
venting only?
[SPEAKER_02]: So dehumidification, we have a huge
dehumidification capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's winter, we get cold air outside,
and we have to warm up this air,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's dry air, and it's pretty
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the strategy for summer and winter is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's based on what's the outside
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we flush all the air, if we're flushing
out or if it's too cold, sometimes we get
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% of new air, and 20% of new air.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of things, and it's where
somewhere, kind of control stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's like three bucks, or from a
climate control point of view,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy in a greenhouse is the biggest
stuff with labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically dehumidify how much
humidity you can take, where the dry air
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from, where we spend energy on it,
electricity while we get it from outside
[SPEAKER_02]: or for certain ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why doesn't it cost us as far as CO2 goes?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're in the early vats of water
room, we spend a lot if there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of CO2 in the air, and then around the
time we circulate as much as we can to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep our CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, David, I have some more questions
for you, but why don't we tackle them in
[SPEAKER_06]: the next space if we want to keep this
moving along?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is coming through.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very cool that you have that
ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so basically, while we're switching
rooms, I can do some talking, but what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're sharing with us is essentially that
you're using a chart when you talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: humidity and temperature in that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at the vapor pressure
differential, so they're relative to each
[SPEAKER_06]: other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're managing that when you say
you're talking about how that outside air
[SPEAKER_06]: gets conditioned or prepped before coming
into the greenhouse and also looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: how you're managing the air in the space
and choosing to vent.
[SPEAKER_06]: You essentially have complete control over
all of those aspects when we're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about air, and that's all related to the
temperature that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to highlight that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like we're frozen here right now
as we're switching over to the next Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_06]: section, but hopefully we'll be back on
soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming you can hear me while we're
making this switch for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: David, there are some great questions
people are asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you're slowly coming back on
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, David?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're still a little bit choppy
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: David, hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your video hasn't quite caught up yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back right now.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you be a little bit louder,
David?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what room are we in right now,
David?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you said there's 4500 plants and you're
around day 18 in flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, roughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people are asking
questions about the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those questions are, do you put
worms in your beds and does the soil get
[SPEAKER_06]: turned over when you go to reamend them
after harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is no warming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some tests a little bit in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warms weren't great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old beds turned into basically warm
caskets after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had so much worm that I was
wondering how the fertilizer would go to
[SPEAKER_02]: warm biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked into a bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can manage the worm with managing
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have longer irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I would love to be able to
try, but at the moment we're using for
[SPEAKER_02]: high quality warm caskets.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you are using worm castings with making
compost teas, but they're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing a lot of worms in your bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got some warm casting
at some point that was full of warm egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have another of the initial
facility we started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many warms in those beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of looking great too, but it's
just something that before we deployed
[SPEAKER_02]: this, our scales just went up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a little bit more trials with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I would add when you're working
with these so-called living soils,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you are managing your irrigation and
you use warm castings, you will get the
[SPEAKER_06]: eggs like you mentioned, and a lot of
times work will show up after a few cycles
[SPEAKER_06]: in my experience in your beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's an interesting thing to
look at is at what level of biomass worm
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass are we potentially beneficial or
possibly at some point it could become
[SPEAKER_06]: detrimental if it's literally all worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on though, some people were asking
if you turn the soil when you go to
[SPEAKER_06]: reamend it and do you share it all?
[SPEAKER_06]: How you are?
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're amending with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that you share
information on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably have like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have our own way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will add stuff to our cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get this lot of altering in those
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like an incredible amount of
work for us, but we stuff grass and we get
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed in the first few inches of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to be working very well for
us so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful and how often are you testing
the soil?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and some OK, so I just I'm just
going to close the blind because I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: show you what it looks like when we can
turn this.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, while you're doing that, I'm going to
tackle a couple other questions here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone asked if you created your soil or
if it was outsourced.
[SPEAKER_06]: I happen to know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a soil that you formulated and
created yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You and I actually have had discussions
in, you know, in regards to some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: theories and optimal target values and
things like that regarding these soils
[SPEAKER_06]: based off of soil tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Stephanie also asked you use
fertilizer or only rely on organic
[SPEAKER_06]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, essentially these organic amendments
are the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're feeding the microbes in the soil
that are then cycling a lot of these meals
[SPEAKER_06]: and nutrients, things like alfalfa meal or
kelp meal or whatever nutrients you choose
[SPEAKER_06]: into plant available fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to tackle those two
really quickly for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I appreciate you mentioning
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did come up with a commercial soil
available through Black Swallow Living
[SPEAKER_06]: Soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are wonderful guys over there and I
would love to run a trial at some point in
[SPEAKER_06]: your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I worked for a couple years with
them with formulating a soil that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: commercially available for Canadians as
well as the US here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to talk about the blind
system?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so right now you guys are looking
about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now during summer time we're able to
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: In and out depending on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning and some rooms that are in
the sun in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to close them earlier,
but it's actually quite impressive out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also neighbor like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leading right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light so that gets quite bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, but there's no cover at night and
it's a cloudy night.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much like reflection in the
clouds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And above the shake curtain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does a little bit of a heat traffic
to keep the greenhouse warm in the winter
[SPEAKER_02]: or bounce back some of the lives in
produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's translucent curtain up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the younger plants or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reducing the light level for a very bright
day with the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the planet can make it stretch
from wiser from anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's her first thing that we do when we
just want to stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reduce the light level and allows
them to catch up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to highlight, since the
connections a little bit rough,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a shade curtain and a blackout
curtain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have the ability to totally adjust
your light levels and then those fluent
[SPEAKER_06]: lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said go up to 800 PPFD as
supplementary light for days when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: not getting as much solar energy or light
as you would like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I assume those lights are
dimmable so you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not coming on at 800 PPFD
immediately like if you only need 200
[SPEAKER_06]: PPFD, then they'll come on to adjust that
and that's all computer software
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's looking like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to turn them back on so we
can see again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens pretty quickly too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing that you have such fast
control over the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so responsive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really when there's a last gap
closing it's been really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also really, really cool for us
for heat management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can like have different type of overlap
from the shade curtain in the blackout
[SPEAKER_02]: curtain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say when we're.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treating this room with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can produce dim on a light during
the treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase the humidity for a day or two
just to give a chance to the benefit cells
[SPEAKER_02]: to reproduce and really heal the pest
insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And managing your light level with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn how to work with this awesome green
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the most excitement that we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of frustration too sometimes that
with complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Troubleshooting with what we're able to do
with this greenhouse is just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more that it's coming up
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working with a lot of people to
develop new tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you personally met a good
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So exciting for organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so David, let's talk a little bit about
microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned Francois and I know that he
did some research on some insect grass
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the day for you and found it had
some good calcium solubilizing and P
[SPEAKER_06]: solubilizing microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're working with a couple
company now on the microbial side.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned compost tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: What sort of microbial additions are you
doing in your in your rooms right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're we're doing compost tea and we build
some good mobile
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth promoting rhizobacteria that
we started to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with and we did some trials and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have a commercially available
product with that which is very close to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit like I think a lot of people in the
state know Mammoth tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth tea is not available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make our own solution which
is different in Mammoth tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more mode of action,
but basically we have selected,
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated and tested and it's very
competitive environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can benefit from using this product
called microbial mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll give you some sample a little bit
if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good fun response to
de-solubilize beneficial bacteria and
[SPEAKER_02]: de-solubilize phosphorus and de-solubilize
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that's where Francois really
delivered in finding microbial mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He added some bacteria that produced
enzyme and side aerophores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And aerophores are little chelating agents
for stuff like copper, iron, manganese,
[SPEAKER_02]: boron, micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're an organic fertilizer,
organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really helps mineralize them and give
us a good growth rate response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the steps in compost tea
to benefit cell ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting there and we're very excited
to hear your response here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me do everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll remember one of the guys who
fuzzled after talking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're using just a highlight because I
said, it's a little tricky to hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're using everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you mentioned root shield,
which is a trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned Boveria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those products are more for IPM or pest
prevention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas you have other things that you
mentioned, like the compost tea or this
[SPEAKER_06]: microbial mass product, which I'm really
excited to test out and then learn more
[SPEAKER_06]: about and possibly even offer here in the
United States here soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those products are more for plant growth
or overall plant health.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sort of a two pronged approach there on
the microbial side, which I know you and I
[SPEAKER_06]: have talked, you feel is just as important
as a lot of the nutrients and fertilizers
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're doing in the facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's keep the tour moving along.
[SPEAKER_06]: One other question that Guy asked here,
and I'm trying to get to as many questions
[SPEAKER_06]: as I can, people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked, with the pure size of this
facility, how do you manage all this green
[SPEAKER_06]: waste?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that was a really good
question because you must be producing a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we just compost it on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically we have a chipper,
like a big wood chipper, so we will stamp
[SPEAKER_02]: the waste in there mixed with some tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not reusing this compost in the
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do stuff like that, but we do have a
community farm on site here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We offer a little community plot here so
people can use that to fertilize their
[SPEAKER_02]: garden in the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So real quick, David, you actually sound
pretty good right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me just ask you a couple other
quick questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are asking about irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one question is, do you run compost tea
through the drip tape?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other questions are, how are you
managing soil most moisture and irrigation
[SPEAKER_06]: in these rims?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we will run compost tea through
the drip tape, but we'll just leave to you
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that if you want to do that,
just got to make sure that you get a drip
[SPEAKER_02]: tape that you're not going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your compost tea will get filtered through
the proper migrant site before you get
[SPEAKER_02]: into your irrigation tubes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's for you to figure out what the
equipment that you're running and also
[SPEAKER_02]: flush your line after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've applied it by hand too, and hand
application works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes forever when you're watering
one of a football field and a half by
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we manage the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple strategies that we can
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have soil moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the total amount of light
that the plants are getting every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we are in a water base and the amount
of irradiation that we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that the plants are getting so
much energy that that's where we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: start thinking about the green out watts
per square meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plants are getting so many watts,
well then it means they're going to need
[SPEAKER_02]: so much water to make up for the update of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can just have the plants on a timer
so every hour we water four minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: four times per root.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an example of a common strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's a lot of walking your
green out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk and check, walk and check
everything so you can find different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of growth, different rain, and also
different seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideal green scenario would be there's a
bunch of companies out there that do a
[SPEAKER_02]: real time irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically you have a soil moisture sensor
that can talk to your climate control
[SPEAKER_02]: software, so Argus, Riva, Dimatec,
a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can set thresholds in the same
way that you can, oh if the room reaches a
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 degree exhaustive while the soil
moisture level reaches its limit,
[SPEAKER_02]: water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's getting to more precision
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an orange shirt and field
crop, which I think have worked really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good especially, then we can have
different zones in your green out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we are in the north side of the
green out and it's getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: left light in winter and in the south side
of the green out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is stuff that you learn off work
at your festivities, but it's just trying
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and testing it, but just trying it a
little bit and building on all that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to walk a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go ahead and move on to the next
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to see the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: As they move further into flowering here,
it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the hall and we're going to see if
they're going to be harvested in about 2-3
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a couple of people have asked about
your pruning.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're doing any lollipopping,
how you're pruning your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you touch on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cool shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you touch on your pruning for me
David?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey David, I hate to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to hear you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you were saying that you're trying
to select phenotypes that require less
[SPEAKER_06]: pruning because of the amount of labor
involved on the scale that you're at,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's just a little bit hard to hear
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just maybe talk a little louder
moving forward here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get Tyler to keep giving you a
shot of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll try to talk a bit louder,
but yeah, this is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the different phenotypes that
we're selecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this type of plant architecture here
that's never really been pruned,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's never been really believed,
it's giving us very good yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we have some plants that are really
dense in foliage, really packed and
[SPEAKER_02]: compact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants that are stretching a little bit
look like they're doing better for us,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is what we've been trying to show
like for in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pruning takes a lot of time, so that's one
aspect of it, but the second one is also
[SPEAKER_02]: timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do plant this and the plants are
looking really good, leave them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right time, give them a little light room
as we're planting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what it means.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time we have a plant in our
hands, we're drinking, make as many action
[SPEAKER_02]: or tasks as needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we make like tops, we leave a little
bit and prune as planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting our vetch plants in there
that are about 18 to 24 centimeters tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we don't have to judge them as much
later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenotype collection is a big one too,
so that's how we approach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not been perfect and we're learning
against growth and scale, but we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling some really good numbers anyway
out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main difference we've seen is a bit of
potency because the plants are getting
[SPEAKER_02]: less light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not at the bottom part of the
plant, so we tend to keep this stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: an extraction or for a hash making
production, which is a new thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new project that we've started here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, so a couple other quick random
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the excess water from the irrigation
reclaimed or recycled?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a lot of excess water with the
way that you're managing these plants or
[SPEAKER_06]: these beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little
[SPEAKER_06]: hard to hear you, David, but I think what
you're saying is you collect both the
[SPEAKER_06]: rainwater and the runoff, the runoff
through a gutter system, the rainwater
[SPEAKER_06]: through the ceiling, and it's all filtered
and collected and then recycled.
[SPEAKER_06]: When possible, is that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another random question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we talked about that microbial mass
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it's available in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: yet, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it available in Canada?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you address that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available with the quality wholesale,
which is the commercial hydroponic garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hydroponic gross shop suppliers,
they have a bunch of good stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're starting to carry our microbial
mass product, but we're just rolling it
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the space, and we'll make sure that
we'll get you a few samples that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: give them in your bus pass or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can get them to get at least a try,
but it's a really awesome product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really happy with it, and yeah,
it's been really good to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's a cool answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The coolest part about it, too,
is that we had a lot of commercial tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: growers or field potato growers that tried
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't work for commercial ag,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we work with cannabis specific
inputs, if they work in commercial ag and
[SPEAKER_02]: it makes sense for a guy that's growing
potatoes or tomatoes in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: he can monetize that and grow out some
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good input to add in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a key point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about to record a podcast with
Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bug lady, and that's something that I
think that we're going to cover when we
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about evaluating a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that we want to look for products
that are out in commercial ag or make
[SPEAKER_06]: sense in commercial ag, because if it can
make sense on a lower value crop,
[SPEAKER_06]: then it certainly can make sense for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a good thing to highlight
there that you pointed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell us a little bit about what
day and flower you are and what cultivars
[SPEAKER_06]: you're running in this room?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this room, we're about in the beginning
of week seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that about a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really finishing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a baba kush crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got something that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a west coast kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me a lot of the story we're
growing up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful west coast kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so lucky to live that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another really cool training here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been a beautiful pinot job from
the process that we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Organic Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a big structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get really good yield on it,
surprisingly good yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that's about 20% change for us,
so we're just rolling those things up and
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that scale three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got beautiful bud development in
those up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's good tri-column development as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking forward to what we're going
to get in terms of harvesting those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got you to find dune recently as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting some really nice increased
growth from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: About two weeks and you think they're
going to finish much taller?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this about the height your plants have
been finishing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're going to finish at this
height.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a room that's mostly going for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's CBD crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in the summer, plants tend to
stretch a lot in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to adapt the climate strategy and
growth strategy to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same strain looks a bit different in
winter and summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fairly good ideal if you want to
tackle that now, but that's part of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing with the season and the greenups
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: David, take me through your re-amendment
process and harvest process.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to come in here, pull the
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you pulling out much of the root
balls?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: How soon are you replanting?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can replant it after harvest if we
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of different liquid and
dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can add
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of a compost here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff that's going to activate the
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a breakdown of the
organic matter as fast as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time the plants recover from the
sub-dressing, the old plants, when we
[SPEAKER_02]: removed the stock, the roots tend to die
and break down way faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly simple, actually, the way
we've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest one for us is managing the
water for us to make sure we can
[SPEAKER_02]: transition from one room fast enough that
we're getting into a very good base.
[SPEAKER_02]: This room is going to be empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our target is empty only for a day or two,
and then we can replant in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we talked about microbes already,
but a few people have asked if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: using any probiotic, Korean natural
farming, indigenous microbe sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: strategies in this facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly like that, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like those ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of compliance in everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of good food and stuff that
we have to go with with the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use good compost and register.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to prove that they've been
following certain thermals, temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that before us to go harvest
wild-type microbes that are probably very
[SPEAKER_02]: highly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't got to up-plant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would do that if we were to,
but we do use different compost now,
[SPEAKER_02]: different type of amendments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm hearing is you're not
necessarily opposed to it, but also I
[SPEAKER_06]: would think on the scale that you're at,
you need to have very controlled inputs to
[SPEAKER_06]: know what you're adding into your garden
because it is such a massive scale too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would just be something I think
that would factor into in that decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, we're going to show you maybe a
bit of the bed area and implanting area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laptop's going to overheat in the sun
right now, and we're not moving around,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's getting pretty odd for us to go in
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just hard to want to leave the
flowering room there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks great in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, and it keeps looking better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps looking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two first lives that we're
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, this is the first time you go
straight and sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always learn a little bit,
but the potential we see in some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: ramps, as far as the deal that some tempi
goes, is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some tests on our end.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it's above 32%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's great.
That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, I'll read some more of these
questions that people have been asking,
[SPEAKER_06]: one of them being I know they're asking
about odor pollution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you control odor pollution?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is part of your licensing rules,
company standards?
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, what size and quantity of carbon
filters are you running for this room?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you had mentioned that you do have
carbon filters, that the air will be
[SPEAKER_06]: scrubbed before being exhausted,
but I didn't know the size of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And someone else had also asked how many
lights are in a room, and that was another
[SPEAKER_06]: question that I wanted to throw out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that a compost tea brewer right
there that we walked by?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that your bioreactor?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a batch tank that we use in
bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a light personalizer
by headwatering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Nixon tank.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's noisy in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you keep walking, David.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you get to the next room,
maybe you could answer those two questions
[SPEAKER_06]: about number of lights and also size of
carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said 800 lights, is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those the Vipers that you're running
to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Viper X Plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Viper X Plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, Fluence is a lucky company to have
your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a huge order.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so those are LED lights for people that
are wondering.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're from Fluence who is now owned by
Osram.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're an LED manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They make wonderful lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Fluence also has great customer
services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particles are all a consulting thing,
and we've been working with them for,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with them for over six
years now, and they're just a good
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a lot of really good credible
information about DPD to highlight the DPD
[SPEAKER_02]: on their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just really approaching it from
the commercial ag point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, this is a huge facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: David,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm losing you for just a moment here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's just hold off while it reconnects
on your end, at least with the
[SPEAKER_06]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Space, if you could give us just one
second here before you start up,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, looks like we're still waiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: One other question that Ben asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you go ahead and continue and
I'll come back to Ben's question here in
[SPEAKER_06]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right now we're in what we call
the Sparha building, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation event area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I've been here since just
looking for a room, and I think it's right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do here is this is where we
have a vertical growing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are cloning vertically and
vertically and.
[SPEAKER_06]: So David, I know I know you're moving from
space to space and this is just not a
[SPEAKER_06]: normal thing that you would do,
but we have this tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about propagation though and
your employees, would you have specific
[SPEAKER_06]: employees that would pretty much stay in
propagation and other ones that would stay
[SPEAKER_06]: in flower to sort of avoid this cross
contamination from an IPM perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we got to be absolutely too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teams that are like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They learn and master the path of
propagation, transplanting and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can stay on the path for longer
until they get really good, then they can
[SPEAKER_02]: treat someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we also have a weekly pest report
and stuff like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know there's some room that if
there's potential trips or spider mites
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that, I'm not going to go
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also moved from the youngest room to
the oldest room as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where would we looking at right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now you're looking at some of the
vertical growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is profit we're growing in here
for the extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shoot it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really selected it for biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about to be harvested,
but they get absolutely passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there so and it's a it's one of we
really select that for biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see very well hand
next to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this is the first vertically
integrated living soil system I've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: actually seen on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will access card inside the size
of your credit card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got big fat sausage fingers,
so sometimes it puts things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one is yeah, it's really good and
this is not like necessarily desirable for
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that, but as far as biomass go for
extraction, it's kind of a loose open
[SPEAKER_02]: flower dries fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good CBD content.
[SPEAKER_02]: It mills very easily, so for extraction
that Pino's been like awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing with this, what's that
cultivar before you move on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte Angel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Dutch fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and the other thing that you can think
just a step back if we haven't here this
[SPEAKER_02]: system here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we bench plan, but this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile so the life and irrigation is
stationary, but it's so right we can take
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live through the harvest area or we
live to one way for plant and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live to a place where we take 200
plants at a time and they're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that we work with influence,
but also Bob Hoffman from Shenandoah
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers, which has the largest commercial
land producer in the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow organic basil and a bunch of other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came up with this and Bob's been a pioneer
in the horticulture and green out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows more about it for a bit more
about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll ever know probably, but that's one
of the really neat little thing that was
[SPEAKER_01]: not that expensive, but really increase
workflow efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this room has been in a two level room
for sparring and.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going through a massive amount of
harvesting right now, but this is what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were seeing earlier today or people just
coming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big this and we will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what size are those plants in terms
of the container size that they're in?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're vegging in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Abigail just want to get a little a little
bigger than we want it to, but it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: in there for about three weeks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they want to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this longer than when we ideally want
and that goes back into my my timing
[SPEAKER_02]: question sending comments earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super beautiful recovery of those phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: When everything is right, then 12 days
after we transplant them to clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots have only did one turn the pot
and they're ready to go in and 1618 days
[SPEAKER_02]: nearly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, Dylan's asking what the capital
expense was for this facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious about that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that's public?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of public information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of processing and
packaging stuff that we're touching that
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no drying room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the new driving facility for
trying to install continuous drying lines
[SPEAKER_02]: here using vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no packages to basically start
everything from easier and we do the final
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging that's going to get shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of infrastructure that's
built around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is more than just growing and drying
and selling both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to be as integrated as possible for
the whole entire process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: One other random question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those those fluent slides put out 800
PPFD, but what are your targets for veg
[SPEAKER_06]: and flour in terms of in terms of
lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a very sunny day in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just natural light.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you're aiming for 1000 to 1200.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your lights can provide up to 800,
so you're counting on the sunlight
[SPEAKER_06]: providing at least 400.
[SPEAKER_06]: Per day and when they're when everything
is opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving to work daylight integral as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more better than life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're looking at how much light
they're receiving over a given period of
[SPEAKER_06]: time or daylight, daylight interval.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so your lighting company helps you
with calculations on all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is important thing to point out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so your lighting company should also help
you with your layout based on their
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge of the lighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should help with calculating out a
lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be able to tell you what light
levels you'll receive under this layout so
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't have to do that work and a lot
of times they'll even help with the
[SPEAKER_06]: rebates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stuff with your local state and county
rebate stuff, so that's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then how large is the facility
overall?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your square footage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, I'll let you continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well that's mostly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now going to grow and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the propagation to you like
vertical flying racks quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: More to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: More questions or anything that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I think that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a wonderful tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to see the facility and I hope
to make it up there someday and I know
[SPEAKER_06]: you're constantly learning and innovating
and one thing I'd be curious about is to
[SPEAKER_06]: hear what sort of plans you guys have with
the research that you are doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much of that is going to potentially
be published or is that all staying in
[SPEAKER_06]: house or are you guys running a lot of
trials these days?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're running a lot of trials on
different things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can you hear me right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hear you great in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this is the best yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so yeah, we're running a lot of
trial, but it's all internal and.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to share with other.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other people that help us and like I
truly believe it that would sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody do it better and we learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as nothing planned so far,
we don't have research or university
[SPEAKER_02]: partners yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in talks with some of them,
but it's been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, far as and also as competitive
things are getting to and others really
[SPEAKER_02]: other Canadian are going to greenhouse
producers are listening here and we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: like doing our little things and all that
is a bit of a professional secret that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There too, so there's a bit of all of
that, but it's still still ag and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reannounce management and all that too,
so we have a really awesome, beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and we're learning how to work
with it a lot from really good stuff more
[SPEAKER_02]: than.
[SPEAKER_02]: Publish a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Internship program and other stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm I'm lazy David.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bit louder, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a huge learning opportunity for
us hiring people that are coming from the
[SPEAKER_02]: research side and have a good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Background, but we haven't published
anything yet ourselves yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you do the publishing part that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to come up with some research
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think that's I think that's
important part of the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, and I appreciate my
conversations with you and even you just
[SPEAKER_06]: opening up the facility to let us tour it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of facilities aren't aren't
open to that, especially on your scale,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proud about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited about it and we're learning
a lot of that, but keep us engaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's the part of the love hate
relationship with agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been reading us very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're coming up with this fall in
this winter is going to be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one other question I had on here from
guy that I thought was a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucky lucky him during the process of the
design.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the one thing that you had to go
back retrospectively change increase to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually meet your demand or needs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there any one thing that if you could
go back and wave a magic wand,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd say, oh, this is something I wish
I'd done or hadn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's something I wish I hadn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overbuilt a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can, you're never going to ask too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power or keep in mind like the general
small day to day functionality as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to rely on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy with a lot of growers and people
that you need to make it that you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it actually functional for them for
what you're going to do with your grocery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that thing and make your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flexible or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't max out the power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need to buy your power?
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of things don't like you're going
to need 98 megawatts on what you buy or
[SPEAKER_02]: you build for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you know the half of the future
expansion of going to change things and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about the media part of it,
but also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, change a few things, but nothing
dramatic, nothing that crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and then my very last question.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it like growing this much cannabis
in being the world leading organic
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis grower on the on these on this
indoor facility or hybrid facility?
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's a ton of work, but I mean I
think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no longer a proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: This idea that we can reuse soils in a
controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is this is no longer just an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the just a highlight for listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea behind this is that by not by
reusing the soil that allows like a
[SPEAKER_06]: company like T God to not have the labor
of moving a massive amount of media in and
[SPEAKER_06]: out of facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not utilizing something like
Rockwell, which is not sustainable and
[SPEAKER_06]: actually quite damaging to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also so not only they reducing their
labor, but also their cost for fertility.
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of inputs that they're using
for fertilization is so much lower than
[SPEAKER_06]: more traditional methods of cultivating
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, it's a it's a tough concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of work what they're doing,
but overall it's saving him a ton of money
[SPEAKER_06]: and a ton of labor and is much,
much more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the more conventional models that
you've seen out there, so I commend you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys for pulling it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great community of growers and I'm
honored to know people like you and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: wonderful working with T God and putting
together this event and the facility tour

[SPEAKER_06]: tour and we're going to our best to share
