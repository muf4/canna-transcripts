[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm back in the grow room
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready to amend these beds and
get set up for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in case you missed it, here's some
shots of my crop from last cycle using
[SPEAKER_00]: this exact same process and then feeding
nothing but water during the entire crop
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already done a soil test and I got my
report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I am adding to the bed and
this is everything I need for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility for the entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be adding any teas,
any ferments, any other fancy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the ones I'm going to scratch
into the soil next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the magnesium sulfate,
the Epsom salt and the potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mixed with water and I'm going to water
this in with a watering can, but I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really that simple running just
water this whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can see just how affordable
and easy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is less than $10 worth of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what most fertilizers are made up
of anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a great way to save money and
get exactly what your plants need in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of targeted fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I threw on a mask to keep any
particulate out of my lungs and now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and digging the nutrients
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come back over the top and
water in the potassium sulfate and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to let this sit for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the microbes work all the nutrients
and then I'll be planting into the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
time.
