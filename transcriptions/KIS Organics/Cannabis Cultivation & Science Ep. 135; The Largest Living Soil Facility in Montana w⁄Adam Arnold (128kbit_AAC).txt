[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before getting into the podcast,
I wanted to let listeners know of a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we have a new bloom booster
that we've been formulating and testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now available on our website and is
the cleanest organic bloom booster on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a new soil blend using a new
compost source from Seacoast Compost that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the lowest heavy metals with the
highest fertility and beneficial biology
[SPEAKER_00]: of any of our mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a tight regulatory state,
please reach out because I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Adam Arnold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam is the founder and owner of
Collective Elevation in Bozeman,
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collective Elevation is one of the largest
living soil cannabis greenhouse facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's been growing cannabis for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 10 is facility in Bozeman,
which was designed and built from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground up by him and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to recreational legalization in
Montana, he built off-grid greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in Montana during the medical
days and has founded Collective Elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: on a platform of sustainability,
utilizing sun-assisted living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to school at the University of
Idaho for conservation biology and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resource ecology and worked in wilderness
management for the Forest Service prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the pleasure of visiting Collective
Elevation last year and filmed my tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the nicest facilities I've
ever seen in person and I'm honored that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been using our soils in their
greenhouses for over a few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honored to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners a little bit more
about Collective Elevation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to, right from the beginning,
suggest that if folks enjoy this interview
[SPEAKER_00]: and would like to see the facility that
we're talking about, we did put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube video last year when I got to tour
the facility in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on YouTube already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just search for it and it's a
great example of a wonderful greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: operation in Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Adam, take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about Collective
Elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Collective Elevation, we're the
largest living soil facility in Montana,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the largest cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Singularly, we are the largest cultivation
facility in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We evolved from, in the early days of
Montana's medical program, like 2011 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 12, we were, my business partner was a
hydro grower and I was a living soil hoop
[SPEAKER_01]: house off-grid grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a place out in the boonies that was
just all solar powered.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started our first dispensary,
after a couple of years of knowing each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, we basically saw that my style was
producing more cannabis cup winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually winning more awards with
the living soil and off-grid approach than
[SPEAKER_01]: we were with fancy Dosatrons and hydro and
salt-based systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also it was just far more profitable
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had stumbled upon this, one of these
rare win-win-wins in the world that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't happen very much in business where
something is a better product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: better for the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have a knowledgeable group or a
team, you've got something that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stumbled upon something that was rare
in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we bought this new facility,
I also did see the limitations of having
[SPEAKER_01]: an off-grid facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really run year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have beautiful mom rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as we want to be sustainable,
you got to have proper electricity and a
[SPEAKER_01]: connection to the grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I needed to be closer to town to
have access to labor so that I could build
[SPEAKER_01]: the team of my dream so that it wasn't
just all on my shoulders and just stoking
[SPEAKER_01]: wood stove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, in 2012, 2013, I was stoking
wood stoves at midnight, 3 a.m.,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fall, running the trim crew all
day, working 16-hour days with breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole time, I was just daydreaming
about my dream greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that utilizing the sun,
especially in Montana in the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: has huge benefits to not only terpium
profiles and quality, but also from
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that off-grid background really
puts some ideas in my head, but I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: daydreaming of my dream facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to build it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be run from an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to control everything from my
phone, which led us to this Wadsworth
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a team that I can rely on as a
specialist in every category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I was daydreaming and planning
my dream facility while working way,
[SPEAKER_01]: way too many hours in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, the cannabis industry in Montana
changed such that you had to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and produce everything on your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't do any third-party sales or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they forced us to basically have to
have a dispensary if we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started our first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That year, there was also a cannabis cup
where we entered a bunch of our products
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Montana State Providers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really dominated that particular
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also reset the industry in that the
biggest providers in the state at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time got set back to three patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some court cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, us little guys and the big
guys all got set back to the start line
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to all start with three patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that court case went through,
the people who had a five-year head start
[SPEAKER_01]: on me were down to the same amount of
patients as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were off to the races and we had a
really good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ended up being one of the best jump
starts for our business to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: build.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also bought a 38-acre property here in
Bozeman that year and started designing it
[SPEAKER_01]: from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first greenhouse we built was
just treated lumber and a little house
[SPEAKER_01]: style that had worked really well as far
as light deprivation manual, light tarp
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling on my old farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built that to tide us over while we
brought power in and did everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working on getting a hold of
Nexus, which was our first automated light
[SPEAKER_01]: dep system greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nexus were the first two and now we've got
two 3,000 square foot Nexuses or 12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square foot Nexus facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another 12,000 square foot next
gen facility that we built in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically just started building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were on a budget and we had to
build the first 3,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and a mom room and warehouse,
head house connected to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That forced us to design as we went.
[SPEAKER_01]: While in many ways that was a hindrance
because we had to build on a budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: in other ways we were able to learn a lot
of lessons as we expanded our facility and
[SPEAKER_01]: we did actually leave our footprint blank
enough that we could expand into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: yet learn from our mistakes as we went.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a huge benefit because if you
would have given me $8 million in 2018 and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, hey, build out this facility today,
I think I would have made a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a really big benefit for
us to just build and design and evolve as
[SPEAKER_01]: we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we started building the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we started building our
team and the dream facility coupled with
[SPEAKER_01]: what is now the dream team.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first employees I ever hired
was Danny on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've met Danny, you know his ability to
innovate and design.
[SPEAKER_01]: He picked up where I left off as far as I
had lots of great ideas, but my welding
[SPEAKER_01]: skills were maybe a little weak or my
ability to form Unistra into anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the beginning of the dream team.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we moved on, we grew and hired on.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, it wasn't even specialists.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we really learned from that was in
many ways, it's better to have a blank
[SPEAKER_01]: slate, somebody without a ton of grow
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times all they've built is bad
habits, especially in the days of
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ego and bad habits don't make for a
receptive, innovative team.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good team is one that is humble and can
see the error of their ways or change
[SPEAKER_01]: their minds when presented with new
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that we don't have some experience
growers on the team, but a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: they had that quality of humility and
willingness to learn and change,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially because a lot of them came from
the hydro background.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, they also brought
some good innovation to my side from
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosatrons and plumbing and basically
having good SOPs and some cleanliness and
[SPEAKER_01]: some facility management systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that really helped form the dream
team.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a short period where I was
getting some good employees from another
[SPEAKER_01]: facility that ran a pretty tight ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, my motto was you train them,
we retain them because we were nicer
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people really enjoyed the living
soil concept and even just not working in
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor rooms, which at that time was all
high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It messes with your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as fun versus on a 40 below
winter day when it's cloudy, being in a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice greenhouse or sunny for that matter
and being at 80 degrees is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on a 95 degree summer day like today,
my team's in there and it's 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those things, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They appreciate working in living soil,
working the way these plants have evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dropped a lot of gems there that I
want to go back and highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off though, big shout out to Danny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a amazing, I'm so glad he's part of
your team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful to meet him and you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of your innovation and what you guys
have brought to the collective elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: is really, really fun to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to highlight a couple of things
that you mentioned in there that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners really should pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being that you said that you
built out the facility as you went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is huge because when I built
out my farm, granted it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an edible nursery and we did have a
greenhouse and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a ton of mistakes because it was my
first time doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that we learned
that first iteration that as we grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to improve on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of facilities that want to go
big and they have these massive
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirations, which is awesome,
but they try to do it too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think starting small and scaling as you
learn where your pinch points are and
[SPEAKER_00]: where mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many I can think of and I'm
sure you probably have a pretty long list
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trial something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find that living soil is not the
way that you want to grow for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: or another, or you may find that you set
up a whole facility for hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_00]: then decide to go an entirely different
method of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of your equipment is obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than once too, where these places
will have hundreds of thousands or even
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of dollars worth of obsolete
equipment because they completely changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology and the way they were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to add anything to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also built the facility when the
getting was good in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very profitable from 2017 to 2020,
ironically, during the medical days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my goal wasn't to make a million
dollars, my goal was to design my dream
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was passionate about cannabis,
that was the perfect combination of not
[SPEAKER_01]: being some corporate entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted the best greenhouse facility in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That literally was the core driver,
more than money or anything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: just so we could get the perfect facility
so that we could scale without ever
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrificing quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I knew there was some happy medium
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that really helped was I
have an old living soil facility shop
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my beater car, my R&D facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has really helped a lot in that I've
never bought anything or enacted anything
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale at the farm because it's very
expensive to make mistakes or convert over
[SPEAKER_01]: or you don't even get good accurate tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have some of the first grassroots
living soil four by four beds that they
[SPEAKER_01]: ever made went into that facility in 2016
or 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first tester of going from
pots or in-ground wooden beds to
[SPEAKER_01]: grassroots fabric beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helped like, oh, well, what if we had
a liner on here so that it didn't dry out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the edges so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can give feedback to these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never bought a single LED light without
first running a light in my four light
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seven four light rooms there and
being able to test any new things,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't care if that's genetics,
we never brought new genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never took clones into the farm in the
old days even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I almost do all pheno hunting,
but we make seeds there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make phenos hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all our pheno hunting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get new lights, we test them there
on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get new beds, new soil additions,
new microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally everything is tested at that R&D
facility first, and that is fully indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a little bit less subject to
seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seasonal variations and stuff like that,
so it really gives you a good control.
[SPEAKER_01]: By no means are we advanced scientists,
but it's amazing what you can do with just
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's the beater car that we
try everything before we bring it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm, and that's every single string.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's helped our facility so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's functioning as an R&D space for you
to trial anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just on the phone yesterday with a
grower in Michigan, and they were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some 250-gallon totes of fish hydrolysate,
and one tote allows them to do two
[SPEAKER_00]: applications on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On scale, it's expensive to enact
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize if you're a home grower in a
tent, the cost per plant is not as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a factor, but I think thinking about this
in the same manner allows you to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend your money, spend your time
doing other things, and maybe those other
[SPEAKER_00]: things are scouting your plants,
or maybe it's just enjoying your room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but having to spend your time on labor,
doing things that you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do, or having to make more
applications of whatever is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On scale, I know especially for you,
that just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing things out and then also having a
quarantine space essentially is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using that for, for all genetics
and things like that is an awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend it to every facility I look
at when I see a design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your quarantine space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Offsite is even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to highlight is you
mentioned that you like hiring blank
[SPEAKER_00]: slates, and I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think getting people with a
horticultural or botany background,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not in cannabis allows you to
really shape them to what your goal or
[SPEAKER_00]: vision is at Collective, because I see too
many egos in this industry where people
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and they want to change things and
add a lot of variables, and it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can all learn from each other,
but at the same time, they've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to enact your vision with a positive
attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been crucial, building that team.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you build that team, over the last
few years, we've become an EOS company,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is more of a business than an
entrepreneurial operating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an operating system for our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That highlights, first of all,
there's a accountability chart so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: lines out who's in charge of what
particular task within the facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't get to this scale by
running everything yourself or being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to micromanage every single aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a certain point, you have to trust
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you trust them and they're
amazing, you still need to have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good outline of their expectations and
duties.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things you do on that
accountability chart is you write out the
[SPEAKER_01]: seat, you write out all the duties
associated with that seat, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: find out, does this person get it,
want it, and have the capacity to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular task?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, then what you have is a
sacred cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to that sacred cow mentality,
too many sacred cows that are basically
[SPEAKER_01]: not contributing to the greater good,
not on the same path, and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: getting your team to actually understand
what your one, three, and five-year goals
[SPEAKER_01]: as a company are, because so many people,
they're just winging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just out here surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame them because compliance and
economics and taxes, it beats you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I want to do is go grow cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend 80% of my time now doing meetings
with accountants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My team as well, but we have five
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my stuff, even though where I
came from is cannabis and growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: is now business and retail and really
stuff that it's hard for me to be
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building out that team, showing them what
you expect and that so many people are so
[SPEAKER_01]: used to like, oh, I came from this other
girl and we just do dabs all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your dab table?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no smoking in this facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a lean, mean, professional machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't become the best by just kind of
limping your way through life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually having high expectations and
duties and putting people, pairing their
[SPEAKER_01]: skills with the seat in your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's small, when you have good
people, they have awesome positions to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow into.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get bigger, then all those seats
are dialed, all their expectations are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having a little bit of intention and
getting your entire team paddling in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any given time, they actually know what
our plan is and what our goals are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what our mission as a company is and what
our values are.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what happens, we're not going to
break our ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a living soil, sustainable organic
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else being equal, we don't
break that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time where there's a cost benefit
analysis, run and maybe there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's real questionable, whether it's
really worth it ties always going to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability and the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're using these new cubes that we're
trial and we get 5% better results out of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like preforma cubes, which we've been
recently running the side-by-side with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, they're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pre-charged, they're wonderful,
but they come in plastic trays,
[SPEAKER_01]: every single one and 3000 take up a whole
pallet instead of taking up a little box
[SPEAKER_01]: versus like rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically having the team on board with
what your ethics are and what your goals
[SPEAKER_01]: are really, really helps everyone,
helps you steer the ship away from
[SPEAKER_01]: icebergs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more important now than ever
because it's tight out there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to give you a compliment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few people that I've met in
this journey through this industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: can transition from being a grower to
running a business, essentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: corporation at the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally found I don't have that
skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at managing personnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had a farm, as it grew larger,
things got a lot more scattered because I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have the staff couldn't see that
vision because I hadn't elucidated it very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have delineated tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just kind of a list of tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that accountability and that
transparency and that vision all really
[SPEAKER_00]: well laid out is, I think, one of the key
components to a successful company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's amazing that you're
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I've found with small
businesses, you have to bring in someone
[SPEAKER_00]: for that next stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rarely the founder that's able to
continue on because they don't have those
[SPEAKER_00]: same skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be an incredible grower,
but you may not be good at managing 100
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very different skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to you in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was going to change topics here
and start talking about climate and the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather in Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you want to add anything else
around personnel before we move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as building a team, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the core thing is just keep
an open mind, have good expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that transition that you just
mentioned were expensive lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn the hard way and thank God
that the getting was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our timing was just at a certain point
lucky because I could do the exact same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work a lot physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I work just a lot and not physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could have the same exact mentality
now and try and be doing the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was doing 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't stand a chance today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't evolve fast enough and you
couldn't overcome those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some luck involved there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to really, really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a certain point now, I'm dug in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not like, if I have to evolve to
save everything to the company,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some luck there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just recognize that timing was
crucial for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to add one last point there is I
think treating your staff really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the right person, taking care
of them and making sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing your passion for the work that
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they are enjoying their life that
they're creating at this facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is a huge part of the success and
just the overall mentality and energy
[SPEAKER_00]: around the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that when I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our culture is amazing and always really
has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little bit of that was luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of that was passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because we live in Bozeman,
Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely want my people to enjoy
their life on their days off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're out there skiing or mountain
biking or camping or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: whitewater rafting, they're more likely to
come into, if you're stoked on life,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more passionate about life or
getting after it, you're a lot more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to be passionate about your job as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit harder to
maintain that for me now as to some
[SPEAKER_01]: degree, the crews keep staying the same
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, now I've got a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the core team that has come
with me the whole way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a little bit more turnover in
trimmers and budtenders and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not having beers with the crew or
partying with the crew after work because
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two kids and a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little harder to maintain that
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, I think that my team,
my leadership team does a good job of
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying that torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that culture has carried us a long
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's awesome that you can recognize
that because it's essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy that magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something goes wrong at 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find a spot of mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your IPM guy go home and tell you on
Monday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does he roll up his sleeves,
stay late and deal with that problem right
[SPEAKER_01]: now before it's a huge, huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy that kind of accountability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you lay out those core
values.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team has core values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is accountability,
doing the right thing when no one is
[SPEAKER_01]: looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sustainability is a core value of our
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people know that, we hire and
fire based off of our core values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, anyways, that's that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I hope other people can have
the same success in that regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk into a facility and usually
tell pretty quickly just from a few hellos
[SPEAKER_00]: and handshakes what the energy and the
culture is at that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one wants to work somewhere where
it's dark and gloomy and the owner's
[SPEAKER_00]: always pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's happy with the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all ties together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think creating a good environment
goes a long way to creating good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good point about the
human component.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you mentioned Bozeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Bozeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the weather like there year round?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of Montana, I just think of harsh,
extreme climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys dealing with there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's, I think, 97 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what probably 10 percent RH it'll be
or even maybe a little drier than that at
[SPEAKER_01]: the peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a 100 mile an hour windstorm roll
through Missoula last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, it didn't hit Bozeman or my
outdoor crop would have been annihilated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that actually just missed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's touch and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last winter, we had a week of it hit,
I think, 48 below in Bozeman, 50 below in
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 150 degree and differential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a huge challenge for us as far
as we have basically of the four seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three distinct ones as far as in
the greenhouses are concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's spring and fall are very
similar as far as the challenges we face
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those three distinct phases
have different settings and parameters for
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain on our Wadsworth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that forces us like Danny's been
working on like a master facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar of when do we close up our wet
wall?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do we start using in the middle of
summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using the roof vents because I
don't want bugs to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the spring and fall and winter,
that's hopefully the bulk of what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using to vent the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that 150 degree differential adds a ton
of I would say excitement, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that fun for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the key points that you
like things that that you have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with when you have say, let's just start
since it's summer right now, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges and how you overcome them with
this heat and low humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a wet wall, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of my biggest fears is just
power outage on the hottest day of summer
[SPEAKER_01]: or the coldest night of winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are those things are very scary to
me because it doesn't take long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first or best insurance
policies, we finally just hooked up a
[SPEAKER_01]: large natural gas power generator back up
generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it doesn't run the whole facility,
but it runs all the crucial functions to
[SPEAKER_01]: limp us through a 40 below night at
midnight for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I eat all the heaters and the
mom room lights and you know, a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just the skeleton essentials of
survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will also run the light up curtains
so that I can close the curtains and run a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of exhaust fans with a wet wall on
the hottest day of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wet wall is absolutely essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our our greenhouses are basically
78 to 83 degrees year round summer and
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's a moving target
there where you're you're actually in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, all summer, you're doing a cooling
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you let it get up to 81 and then you
cool it down to 78 versus in the winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: you let it heat up naturally to 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just exhaust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you're you're heating up
versus cooling down and you're letting it
[SPEAKER_01]: rebound naturally in the summer back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the winter, you're heating it up
and letting it cool naturally down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you can never really hit not only
do we have a ton of microclimates within
[SPEAKER_01]: these greenhouses, which is a challenge in
and of itself and something that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to understand, or even like really
measure because usually our Wadsworth
[SPEAKER_01]: brain system just measures a few key
points in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have that's one of our future
goals is to have eight parameter points
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can actually measure that
differential in microclimates throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've made some progress there in the
past and then like life gets busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the summer, you know, that
temperature is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, Danny's actually hooking up
misters as well, because one of our our
[SPEAKER_01]: big goals in all of our transitional
periods from the clone room to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom, you want to match those
parameters for a couple of days as you
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got 90% humidity in the clone
room, you want to have 85% humidity on day
[SPEAKER_01]: one as you transplant those clones and
slowly phase it down a little bit and then
[SPEAKER_01]: get it down to that, you know,
70% in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you need to have as you
transplant into the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to have a super high humidity in
there to basically reduce any
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing in the summer that we found
now, for the most part, it's amazing how
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil is so has it provides such a
wonderful buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be amazed at how many times my hoop
houses that don't have very much control
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost seems like VPD isn't that
important when you have a big deep living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil bed, because those plants can just
absorb 5% humidity and they'll be praying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've regularly outperformed my really,
really nice greenhouses with all the bells
[SPEAKER_01]: and whistles with a simple hoop house and
just natural summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't make any sense because your
VPD is way off, but living soil buffers
[SPEAKER_01]: that to an incredible degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're talking about, you know,
really getting down to the economics of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're trying to shave days off
your cycle, for example, we in the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: room, they're going to spend, you know,
11 to 14 days in the bedroom, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to spend 14 to 18 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to transplant them
from the bedroom into our flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have like 10 to 14 days
in a vegetative growth in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I want it 10 and not 14,
I need to have the least amount of stress
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in that transition so that they
can hit the ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So little things like having misters to,
you know, match the proper VPD that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were at is going to really shave that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while there, this is actually
something that David Perrone, when we
[SPEAKER_01]: finally brought in a consultant,
kind of helped me think before I was
[SPEAKER_01]: always thinking, can I afford this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I spend $12,000 on these systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kind of helped me think,
because a lot of times I don't have anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: to bounce the financial aspects off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what the buck ends here as
far as being an owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you're talking about quality,
consistency, labor reduction with your
[SPEAKER_01]: crew, but you're not talking about like,
yeah, the cost benefit analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David helped me like, all right,
I'm thinking, can I afford $10,000 right
[SPEAKER_01]: now for a mister system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you shave five days off of your
veg cycle in your flowering greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got four greenhouses and you've
got, so basically four and a half cycles a
[SPEAKER_01]: year, you're looking at shaving,
you know, 20 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting 20 extra days of
utilization and flowering in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse times four greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That $10,000 could equal 80, $90,000 a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford not to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like flipping that mentality on
its head of like, oh boy, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend 10 grand right now, but I don't want
to lose out on 20 days of productive
[SPEAKER_01]: growth over the course of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like just changing your mindset of how
to think about these things has been
[SPEAKER_01]: really extremely helpful to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the biggest place I see that is with
upgrading lights from HPS to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, oh man, I can get these
HPS so cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you switch over to LEDs,
a lot of times when we do the math with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these growers, it's like your
savings on the electrical bill within two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three cycles will have covered the cost of
the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just saving, you're just
saving money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's that mentality switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, of what you're currently
doing, what's looking ahead at the future
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at your cost benefit analysis
I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going way back, you mentioned wet walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe a wet wall though for
people who may not be familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: term?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from the Seattle area, it's nothing
that I had ever had to incorporate into my
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's essentially a radiator for a
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does is it's a cardboard wall that
runs water through this cardboard wall and
[SPEAKER_01]: it draws air across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our greenhouses are staged to
have your first exhaust fan is going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on at this temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one degree higher, your second
exhaust fan is going to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your third step is that water is
going to start, your pad pump will turn
[SPEAKER_01]: on, which will run water through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically this is just a cooling
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people refer to them as a swamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooler, it's just a air conditioning,
it's a swamp cooler is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Seattle, Florida, basically the
Montana is absolutely perfect for wet
[SPEAKER_01]: walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher your temperature and the lower
your humidity, the more cooling benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can have 108 degrees here and I can
have my greenhouse, I bet I could get it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to like maybe even into the sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have a 30 plus degree temperature
differential just because of that wet
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think combined with misters,
I know a few other greenhouses here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana that don't have wet walls,
but they have misters and they also use
[SPEAKER_01]: shade curtains, which there's,
don't give me, I don't think that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: best method, but the misters also combine
to help with that cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, increasing the humidity and
getting your VPD in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hotter it is and the drier it is,
the more effective your wet wall is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Montana is literally the dream climate
for a wet wall efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what a wet wall is and it's
crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise our greenhouses, I guess I
shouldn't say crucial because I do have
[SPEAKER_01]: hoop houses without wet walls that are
probably a hundred degrees right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, they're happy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's because of living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was in a hydro system, they would not
be happy with having hot roots like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have found that not having or
having raised beds that tap into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground in a hoop house will really even
improve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more those roots can be cool,
the more they can handle those high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and low humidities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the wet wall is not only crucial to
our operation, but it also increases your
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings you closer to VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, there's two months
out of the year where I don't stand a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of keeping VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is like that July, August time
where I can't get it humid enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although if you check back when those
misters are in, I might finally be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I thought of as you were
explaining that and talking about the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: wall was the tubing that you use to move
large volumes of air across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back to Migro and people have asked
me like, Hey, what are those tubes that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have in the bottom of your beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using greenhouse convection
tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually are using a commercial
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get that commercial product on
the scale of an R&D room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't sell 10 foot sections of
it at an affordable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using greenhouse convection tubing
for anyone listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Duck Socks was the name of the
company that you went with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe that's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another, this is kind of the
beautiful props to Danny for coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: with that because that was another
scenario where I was using floor fans to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes during the winter with
microclimates, we were having mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just adding more floor fans
and more dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year when times were good,
I was just adding, yeah, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, let's put up another dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at a certain point, you got to stop
throwing money at it and you got to start
[SPEAKER_01]: really addressing the root of the problem,
which is, doesn't matter how many
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifiers I put in here, I don't seem
to be fixing this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue was airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that time, we had a higher plant
count per canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing, I think, 12 or nine plants
per four by four bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically had a middle row of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had three on either side and then
three down the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we reduced our plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that we didn't actually lose any
time on our veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also opened up a little aisle
down the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was that we needed a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also increased our pre-transplant
pruning or our post-transplant pruning and
[SPEAKER_01]: our 21 day leafing and pruning events to
reduce transpiration, increase under
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still wasn't quite enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did help solve the problem,
but we were still having like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, dead spots under the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, once again, you pose the problem
to the team and Danny's like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what about these?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, we were originally
thinking about putting those kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: the upper parts of the greenhouse,
but then they block light and there's all
[SPEAKER_01]: these issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with our new lowered plant count and
our increased pruning, there's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: aisle right there under the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Danny kind of came up with that concept
and design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another potential subsidiary benefit
of that is because those and if you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can post a picture and exactly what
company those are on this website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you remind me, I'll have Danny get you
all that information so people know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also sucking up air right off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the CO2 is sinking in there,
you're actually kind of running like CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: rich, fresh air through those duck socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting nice, even airflow all
the way through the lower canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that took us another a
good chunk of the way to solving our
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually a pretty cheap and
innovative solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know going back in time here,
from talking to Klack, it was cute when he
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking about his favorite facility
design, it would be air moving upwards
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from talking to Dr. Nadia Saba,
Dr. Greenhouse, really the airflow expert
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry, she had also talked about
how using airflow like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are listening,
picture like 8 or 12 inch ducting like you
[SPEAKER_00]: would use to duct your house or your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make it out of fabric,
or in my case, make it out of plastic with
[SPEAKER_00]: two 45 degree holes angled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a big 8 inch or 12 inch fan
moving the air through that giant tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's diffusing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large amount of air across a large area
under the canopy at a very high volume but
[SPEAKER_00]: low velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't get calcium issues in
terms of too much evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, you're getting the CO2
pushed back up into the stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it removes a lot of those micro
pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that describes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can post photos for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that microclimate, it definitely
helped eliminate microclimates within the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because anytime you have a big room,
it's not all consistent all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: across.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's colder near the wet wall or the
intakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hotter on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have a harder time
getting your dehumidified air,
[SPEAKER_01]: which obviously isn't a problem this time
of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the winter, you've got different
cycles and different needs summer to
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting that dehumidified air evenly
spread out across the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a whole topic in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you said, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes those leafs dance just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so that you're over transpiring or
getting dry spots, but also so that every
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is getting that fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully CO2 enriched fresh air,
because those beds produce so much CO2 and
[SPEAKER_01]: where they dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing too, is before we
actually put more dehumidified air in,
[SPEAKER_01]: and before we put those duck socks in,
we switched from VAF fans to HAF fans in a
[SPEAKER_01]: circular manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually backing up even before
any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we did was reconfigure our
airflow with overhead fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So VAF is vertical airflow and HAF is
horizontal airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch on that for people who
may not be familiar with these greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those VAF fans, they basically suck up
in a mushroom cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to use a fog machine,
which I've always daydreamed about renting
[SPEAKER_01]: a party fogger and just watching the
airflow in my greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use our dram fogger, but it doesn't
quite produce a drastic enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not drastic enough that we can really
watch, but I've always thought about just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a good party fogger and really
nailing down where there's dead spots in
[SPEAKER_01]: your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But VAF sucks up and through and creates
this mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is as the air comes from the,
in our case, I guess the east side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air is coming in from the intakes and
it's getting circulated in this mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern slowly across the greenhouse,
touching every single leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not so much that any single plant is
getting blasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: HAF is just like a standard box fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have standard box fans,
of course, but they're big circular
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow fans and they're all positioned
kind of in a circular pattern around the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got three just slightly offset
on the north side of the greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_01]: blow to the west.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's three on the east side
that blow to the east.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates this big circular pattern
above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, not blasting anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a racetrack.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in a perfect world, I have recently
seen a Steve Potato Farmer's Nexus
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse where he actually put his wet
wall below the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: His entire greenhouse was metal grating,
his floor, his entire floor was metal
[SPEAKER_01]: grating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got a wet wall and then you have
roof vents and VAF fans, vertical airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically your wet wall is going in
under the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's percolating up through the entire
canopy slowly because heat rises as this
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow is heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just going out the roof
vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, oh my God, if I could
redesign, I might consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty neat concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know as to its efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any experience with it,
but it was a cool design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically in the winter, we typically
are doing a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two greenhouses that are VAF
fans and we have two greenhouses that are
[SPEAKER_01]: HAF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's kind of two schools of thought
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either you're mixing and stirring it in
that racetrack pattern, or you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: letting the warm air percolate up nicely
through the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then out the roof vents and you know,
jury's still out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't found strong enough evidence
to like convert the other ones over from
[SPEAKER_01]: my original design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's a slightly smaller greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another problem that popped up as I
built the two new greenhouses to be 4,200
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually, that bigger greenhouse,
that wider design made it harder for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that dehumidified air over to the
other side of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I put the dehumidifiers on that
side, then that blocks out that southern
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the middle of winter, you need
every bit of sun you can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all these little, every time
you increase your scale or increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of the cylinder, you'd come up with
completely new problems that you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly have foreseen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence why it's better to build out slowly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you mentioned was
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that because you
mentioned the best beds are creating an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible amount of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you manage CO2 in your greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, this is a kind of an interesting
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So living soil, we do have a CO2 burner in
every single one of our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They maybe get used two months a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, we rely on the CO2 that
the microbial action in the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have an empty greenhouse,
when I harvest, I will get over a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million built up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get super high nighttime CO2
concentrations because that soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: producing so much CO2 on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, during the day, two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the summertime, there's no point in
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an influence set with our
watchwork system, our control system,
[SPEAKER_01]: our greenhouse controller, so that when an
exhaust fan turns on, the CO2 burner turns
[SPEAKER_01]: off because there's no reason at a certain
point it's a drop in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the amount of exchange rate
that our greenhouses have on a hot summer
[SPEAKER_01]: day, as far as like freshening the air,
it's probably got new air in it every
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really no reason to run CO2
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, even whether the soil
is keeping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically in the summer, we're not
running any CO2 at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the winter, we were running CO2 for a
long time using those CO2 burners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we actually found was during the
coldest month of the year in Montana,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we actually have the least PAR levels
from the sun, we might be just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: underlit with our LED lights in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm trying to stage it to the lowest
common denominator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have too much light in the summer
and I don't have quite enough light as
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to if I were a full indoor grow
room in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I usually am able to utilize the
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the summer, my lights are
completely off and I'm only using the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 40 or 50% of the winter, that's the
same as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What basically ends up happening there is
if I run CO2 too much in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Maslow's law, the bucket concept?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen the barrel analogy of
there's always going to be some limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factor there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your plants can only perform to their
highest potential based on whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factor is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times in the winter,
when I feel like I need the CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually am a little bit underlit,
especially for that January, February run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of like using nitrous when
your car is an old jalopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not ready to really hit the gas and
you actually ended up getting some...
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we called you with some problems
a few years ago where I couldn't figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having some unusual fox tailing and
growth patterns and I'd believe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was essentially using CO2 when I
was underlit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore the plants weren't really
like matching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a thousand parts per
million CO2 if your PAR is too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really make sense there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do use CO2 in the winter,
but a lot of times it's actually more that
[SPEAKER_01]: November, December, when it's sunny and
spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the exhaust fans are on,
those first couple hours of the morning in
[SPEAKER_01]: say, March, April, that's when we're
actually turning the CO2 burners on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even seen that much
effectiveness there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe basically I could run my CO2
burners and I couldn't even get my
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse up to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: My living soil beds outperform a CO2
burner on CO2 production when there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that's empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never quite tell CO2 production
when the greenhouse is full because those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't have CO2 production.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are actively breathing it as
you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really ever tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Liebig's law of the minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one you were thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, if you can imagine a bucket
with a bunch of holes in it and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: you're plugging the holes to figure out
what the limiting factor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's lighting, don't worry about
your fertility, fix your lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's your VPD, then you got to fix that
before you look at fertility or lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these things are related and
you're constantly as a grower trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what your limiting factor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good perspective when you
approach a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I always do when I walk
into a new grow is I think about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the watering, the fertility,
the lights, the VPD, the airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to the CO2 though,
do you find that you need to vent CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: during nighttime hours in order to not get
excessively high CO2?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an ongoing argument about four
years ago, whether it was worth,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the winter time is when that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the summer, it doesn't seem to
happen quite as much because I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't really, I guess probably
because also in the summertime we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausting somewhere at night anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically in the winter time,
I don't want to ever lose any of my heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to ever exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have limits set with my Wadsworth
system where, depending on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in veg or flour, but so after
7pm, my exhaust fans are all locked out
[SPEAKER_01]: for the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while there, a former cultivator of
mine, Chad, who's really, really
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable guy, we were having this
ongoing discussion or maybe argument about
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we should be exhausting that CO2
at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while I did, but what ends up
happening is technically when your heaters
[SPEAKER_01]: run, they're producing some CO2 too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically I'd exhausted out and because
nothing's transpiring, but the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: is still, it just replaces it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'm running my heaters and I'm
just exhausting warm air, which our
[SPEAKER_01]: utility bills are high enough in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw any evidence that a thousand
PPM CO2 at night had any negative issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then watching Jay Plant speaker argue
with people on Instagram years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he was turning them on an hour or
two in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's turning on a CO2 burner so that that
first hour or two of morning when those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are starting to transpire,
they have this high CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen any evidence that the kind
of CO2 that living soil produces at night
[SPEAKER_01]: has had any negative impacts to me,
but I haven't done a ton of extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: research on it because it's also pretty
costly and we have great, at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, if I have a great harvest,
then I don't worry about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only when I start to have bad
experiences that I start to look for the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's never been the common
denominator is nighttime CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't exhaust it at night anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just assume that first thing in the
morning, those plants are going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: really good CO2 levels until the first
exhaust fans kick on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen excessively high CO2 and I'm
not talking a thousand PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking thousands of PPM, 2000,
3000 PPM of CO2 in some indoor facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were getting weird growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that did fix it was a
nighttime venting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, indoor facility, different
environment altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size of the room relative to the
amount of soil is probably a big factor
[SPEAKER_00]: there too, as well as how much respiration
you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to bring it to people's
attention as something maybe to look for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that's really great that you
don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your case, because you are
greenhouse in the winter and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificing all that heat, you do have to
make a decision as to whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it doesn't sound like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to share a counterpoint of
a different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is why every facility is a
little bit different and everyone needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at their own facility specifically
and figure out what the requirements are
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is always a constant balance
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one hand, you want to maintain at
least ambient CO2, what, 420 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of our current ambient air CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need that airflow exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you're not getting enough
CO2 from your beds, or let's say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not running living soil, those plants are
not going to have sufficient CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're running your PPFD at
1,000 or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no point if there's no CO2 in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you need that air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're exchanging it with really
cold air and now you're at a VPD range,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's creating a different problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, you kind of have to think
through these things and really decide
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes the most sense in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your case, it sounds like the
environment is probably the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor for you because you are
forced to deal with these such extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you have a lung room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you just force, you don't really have
the ability to condition the air in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume in the summer, you're
conditioning there a little bit possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: through the use of your wet wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you do in terms of the air
conditioning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, in the wintertime, I try and
bring in as little cold air as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one thing, it does create a little bit
of a microclimate and some of the early
[SPEAKER_01]: designs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my wet wall is completely sealed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of this master facilities calendar
is sometime around November when you no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer have temperatures above,
say, 45 or 50 degrees, we'll go and we
[SPEAKER_01]: will put black, white, black or double
wall plastic over all the wet walls and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll end all the black out breathable
walls on the other side of the breezeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also do have a breezeway on the
exhaust side of every room so that I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: just sucking all that warm air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually putting it into the breezeway
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you use your smallest denominator
fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the wintertime, I might only use
roof venting for my next gens and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the only exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't bring any air in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, except for what, obviously,
whenever you let air out, some is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get sucked in, but it just gets sucked in
through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're just exhausting hot air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not actually bringing cold air in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the early designs of our... So
this is all a staging question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it gets too warm and there's three
distinct seasons, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, fall count is one for the
greenhouse, winter and summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first thing to come on is our
condensate fan, which is a very upper
[SPEAKER_01]: smallest fan in the greenhouse and that's
like above the blackout curtains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've implemented so many different
trials to first the condensate fan will
[SPEAKER_01]: come on and that's way up there and it has
an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's above the VAF fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has the opportunity to come in and
slowly stir a little at a time so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting like super cold on one
side of the greenhouse and then super hot
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, if it's too warm, so you can have
a zero degree day and if it's sunny,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're exhausting air and you're bringing
in cold air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, after that condensate fan has
exhausted its potential, which very rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in the winter, you'll go to the
gable exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stage two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets to 83 degrees in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gable exhaust fan comes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big exhaust fans are now disabled for
the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never have to use those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the gable exhaust fan comes on,
we have a little ramp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a drawbridge and that's so
that the gable exhaust fan kind of gets
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picture this drawbridge from a castle
halfway up.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it comes in, it gets kind of like
guided up into the upper parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and then once again,
distributed via VAF fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't just sink right on and make
those plants closest to the gable exhaust
[SPEAKER_01]: fan really cold, which also can lead to
like condensation and therefore bud rot
[SPEAKER_01]: when you have these really cold and then a
really hot heater kick on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also settings so that my exhaust
fan can't be on at the same time as my
[SPEAKER_01]: heater is on and my team has to be trained
to, we should be able to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation in the greenhouse and within
five minutes, if an exhaust fan kicks on
[SPEAKER_01]: and then five minutes later, a heater
kicks on, someone on my team needs to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that sixth sense of like, oh, that
shouldn't be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should expand our differential,
but you know, we can make our heaters kick
[SPEAKER_01]: on at 76 degrees or 77 and we won't have
an exhaust until 83 or even 84 if it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore you get this nice yo-yo effect
where ideally depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, depending on the season,
the heater will kick on and the exhaust
[SPEAKER_01]: fan will never kick on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't fully solve all of our
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Wadsworth design us a burp feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on those coldest days of the year where
you're not getting any sun or you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting any par from the sun, so now your
light depth curtains are closing and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: acting as a basically an indoor facility
now and you're just running a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those lights actually, the lights and
the dehumidifiers combined actually
[SPEAKER_01]: produce an amazing amount of heat,
even when they're LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 10 months out of the year,
we really don't use heaters too much at
[SPEAKER_01]: all, or maybe a few times to heat it up in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And get to temperature, but for the bulk
of the day, our equipment is producing
[SPEAKER_01]: enough heat that we're not venting that
it's carrying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our first steps on those cold
days, like when it's, we're talking 40
[SPEAKER_01]: below during the day and I don't care how
much sunshine we have when it's 40 below
[SPEAKER_01]: those curtains are closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not taking that par because I'm
heating too much in order to get that par.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had Wadsworth and they're pretty
awesome about just like, Oh, what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever had that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They built this in a burp feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what'll happen is the curtains
themselves will burp 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll open 5% when it gets to 83 degrees
or 84 degrees and they'll just let a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of air up into that upper
canopy above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, then it just naturally cools
because there's enough heat loss because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a greenhouse that, so that burp
feature has given us one more step in our,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a staging process of the lowest
minimum tool for the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's first, it's a roof vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it would be like a condensate fan,
then a gable fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the curtains are closed and all of
these things have override, so they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want, if my gable exhaust fan
kicks on, my roof vent needs to close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means the roof vent is not doing the
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got too much light coming in or too
much passive solar gains coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and what I don't want is my roof vent
sucking, my gable exhaust fan kicks on and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sucks air through my roof vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that could one suck in bugs,
probably not because it's winter time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also I'm not sucking air across the
room anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm short circuiting, short circuiting all
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might be just sucking air from the
roof vent on the west side to the fan on
[SPEAKER_01]: the west side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually not cooling at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's all the staging system with
the Wadsworth having parameters and set
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we call, you know, they're,
it's a, what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, a lockout essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wadsworth will actually program in so that
just like my exhaust fan can't be on at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time as my heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: If an exhaust fan opens, a heater turns
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a roof vent is open and an exhaust fan
kicks on the roof vent will close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're there and it's a series of
staging and all of this has taken years
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could take my exact SOPs for what
my greenhouses are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could give them to someone and all
of a sudden it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a completely different
mechanism and it's completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: SOPs or you could give it to someone in
Oregon or Washington or Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of that would make any sense at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be very much specifically
tailored to Montana and then Montana's
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest challenges we
face is that, you know, we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible sunlight in the summer and
incredible temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything is opposite in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, in many ways, indoor rooms,
controllability and stability makes
[SPEAKER_01]: growing easy, but it also makes your power
bill high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of these guys I know are
running air conditioners in Montana in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter time, not us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our lights right now, I bet you there's,
except for the mom room and the bedroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's hardly a light on in my whole
facility right now today.
[SPEAKER_01]: My power bill per unit is incredibly low
compared to any of my competitors here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even my heating bill, I think I only
had an $800 natural gas heating bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say only cause it's still
expensive, but for a facility of this size
[SPEAKER_01]: in January, when we had a week of 50 below
or a week of 40 plus below weather,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows you that both my light depth
curtains work really well and my equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone's equipment produces a lot
more heat than they think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when it's LEDs and LEDs produce a ton
of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So investing in the right infrastructure
has saved you a ton of money and the right
[SPEAKER_00]: systems over the last few years since
you've since you've built out this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I really want to
highlight is this idea of SOPs because
[SPEAKER_00]: people ask like, what's the SOP for
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and whether that's around IPM or
in this case the greenhouse, or fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you said is really accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every facility, every space has
different challenges, different
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they really need to be tailored
custom to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just take someone's SOP and run
with it and think you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect method or grow setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely customized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that EOS operating system we
were talking about, not only do we have
[SPEAKER_01]: SOPs, but we have like a core processes
that this, this all integrates the cat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the master calendar with the core
processes, the SOPs, but the core process
[SPEAKER_01]: has had a little bit more room for
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, like if this,
then that, you know, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's, I just need to teach you the
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, that also ties back into
having an amazing team that not only can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, they have the capacity to
understand like, what is, what are we
[SPEAKER_01]: going for here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just, this is the SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because SOP changes from December to July
so drastically that my team has to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually understand like, what are we
going for here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then, yeah, I mean,
that's, that's essential, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: SOPs are very much different summer to
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the other common denominator
there is, I had to obsess over it for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally at before, when I was
smoking Woodstoves at midnight,
[SPEAKER_01]: three and 6 AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on that 40 below night in January,
you better believe if I wake up and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bathroom, I am looking at my app and
I'm watching that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately can never quite shed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also alarms built in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the facility temperature drops below
55 degrees, myself and Danny get an alarm
[SPEAKER_01]: on our phones and the alarm company
actually calls us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets above 88, we get a text,
then a phone call.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as soon as, and you don't,
you want to set it so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one wet wall is clogged for one minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to get phone calls all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second it hits 85, but you set it just
below that parameter where it should never
[SPEAKER_01]: be, which is like I said, 55 and 88.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, we got a problem and two of us
are getting phone calls after we get a
[SPEAKER_01]: text, if there's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also like prepping for during
that 40 below week, you're watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather and we're also putting in backups.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing our now, now that we finally
have a good backup generator, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be testing that, but also we're going
to have staged out sunflower heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's with propane next to every
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in the off chance that the power
does go out and the backup generator
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't turn on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better believe I'll be there at three
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully my team set me up for
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm not trying to call them at three
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there and I'll be lighting heaters
in those greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully those heaters are set there
and staged and ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like your insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, one of the things as a
business owner that, uh, is really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging that no one really talks about
is the fact that you never really get to
[SPEAKER_00]: shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're on vacation, even if you're
at home, you know, using the bathroom at
[SPEAKER_00]: two in the morning, you're, you're still
thinking about your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about your plants and,
uh, you never really get that mental
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't consider that
when they think about setting up a new,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a new business like this or being a
business owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and, and trying to explain that to
the crew, because every day I would look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it as I wake up and I take,
um, basically I'm going to get my butt
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get three pieces of bad news
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee they could be somewhere
between $1,000 pet pieces of bad news or
[SPEAKER_01]: $10,000 pieces of bad news, but I'm
getting the news and you can absorb the
[SPEAKER_01]: first one, even if it's the 10,000 or the
1,000, like it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was beyond your control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's fault here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how do we solve this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we not have this happen again?
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the third one, even if it's the
smallest one, like all of your ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb bad news, has now been taken up and
keeping your cool and having them
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also why it's good that they know
you because they know that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you're, oh, he's a dick today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, geez, you guys look at these
three things that happened to me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I lost my ability to absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my shock absorbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a great mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by like three o'clock piece number
five, you're like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to, but having your crew
actually know you as a person and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully empathize with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a little bit of that is like
actually telling them what you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, apologizing as best you can
when, um, when that does happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, hey, here's why it was
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what we're going to do to fix that
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, um, rather than me be responsible
for that, I'm going to assign that to one
[SPEAKER_01]: of my team members.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going on to the accountability
chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this is your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want you to worry about it so
that I don't have to, because I can only
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now our team with the evolution of
our core processes, our SOPs, a team that
[SPEAKER_01]: truly cares and just, we have just such an
amazing team and somebody in each
[SPEAKER_01]: department that cares and is accountable
for all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the old days, the first few
years, you could track all of our,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say we ever had anything
catastrophic happen, but all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest disasters, you could track them
for the first three years with they lined
[SPEAKER_01]: up directly with my vacations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I ever was in Alaska,
on a camping trip out of reception,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally they, it was like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's no one's fault per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that we didn't have systems in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then the team cared, but I didn't
explain to them those little things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was paying attention to in the middle of
the night or, or even the concept of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so many times the cure is worse than
the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh no, we found aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we root drenched everything with
insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wait, we what now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a new treatment on an entire
greenhouse without trialing it in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: section first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who gave the go ahead on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you were out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it goes in the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime something new happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now at a certain point, I keep saying
this and this keeps not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, my team's probably just
rolling their eyes, but like eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: there won't be any new problems to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have had all the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so someone will know whose job it is
and we'll have a quiver of options to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, and this is already
happening as I've phased into office life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I still do my daily walkthrough every
single day, but unless there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency or a large scale problem,
I'm into the office and onto accounting
[SPEAKER_01]: and my team can handle all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the old days, it was two to
three to four hours of me being this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have a Sawyer, my IPM manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing the scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to get the eye is years
and years of developing the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have some people, Jared too,
the guy who does all our soil fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came from a school background and
didn't have a ton of cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now just recently, he's been
impressing me by finding stuff before I
[SPEAKER_01]: find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the eye now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you can't even, you can teach
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't teach it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put it in an SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eye has to come with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where now I finally feel
comfortable not spending three hours a day
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to everybody about theoretical
growing and conceptual stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this, then that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing is the instinct that,
you know, if you listen to all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you've had on your podcast,
you have an amazing resume of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best people, not just in this industry,
but in the world from a science
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, like it's unmatched,
unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, nor none of my people on my team can
hold the candle to those guys' specific
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, they're willing to learn
and listen to what those guys are saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's something to be said
about not only that steady hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's an instinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, this plant is healthy and I
know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't care what you say about if a
praying plant, you guys can argue all you
[SPEAKER_01]: want about whether praying is bad or
stressful for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know what it does to yield and I
don't really care about the science behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel and have seen and know the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you can't really
like, college doesn't teach that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that standing in a room with someone and
being like, does it feel too humid in
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that sixth sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that magic, the ninja shit that you
cannot buy or train into people except by
[SPEAKER_01]: spending tens of thousands of hours in a
greenhouse and overcoming all these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like my team, either they're
there or they're almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think too, a team member that finds
a problem and then brings it to you along
[SPEAKER_00]: with some potential solutions is worth a
million times more than a team member that
[SPEAKER_00]: just comes to you with a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, that is priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may not go with their solution and
they need to be okay with that because you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have more information that they may
not have access to, or you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in your facility that they
haven't had, but being able to talk it
[SPEAKER_00]: through with them and for them to be able
to bring insight to the problem that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have is absolutely, I think,
one of the most important aspects of a
[SPEAKER_00]: team member.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're 100% T and then you have to have
people, obviously, who are smart,
[SPEAKER_01]: competent and have common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then even teaching them how to think
with that mentality and even throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: those problems back to them like,
all right, well, there's no easy
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions, but yeah, come to me with
these, just exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super essential is, and it also is
empowering to them because now they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come to you next time with just a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come with a couple of
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you don't have to do it,
but you've now empowered them,
[SPEAKER_01]: retrained them how to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually they've already walked
through this system, this process that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've done a million times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they do it without... We don't
even have to bother them this time because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's busy today because we only have three
options and either it's because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: season or the severity of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that this is our go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our second step if this problem
progresses, and then this is our third
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully, as long as you're
evolving your SOPs and core processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should write that new problem in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time that is an issue, you've got to
not only fix it, but what if that person
[SPEAKER_01]: is incapacitated for a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if they're sick that day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to continue to evolve your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just stay put.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to update them regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to touch on in this
call is the praying leaves thing because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think...
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea I was opening such a can of
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happened for people who
missed it is on Instagram, I posted a
[SPEAKER_00]: photo of one of my plants and it was
praying... What we call praying leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's call it a 45-degree, maybe
60-degree leaf angle in an upward
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was speculating that this might be a
less than optimal angle for a solar panel
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would a plant do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone... Not everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people jumped on me for that
saying, praying leaves means your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to the turgor, the pressure
in the leaf, in the stem that creates that
[SPEAKER_00]: angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't arguing that it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to get behind the
mechanism of what might cause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what I learned in that
process is that many of the mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: around it related to like hydrology and
things like that are actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a sign of a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have found that it may be a
sign of low CO2 and that plant is trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to raise the leaf angle as a way of
getting more CO2 to the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I've seen it with plants that are quite
unhealthy with tissue tests that show
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very low in fertility,
yet they're still praying, which just... I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the big consensus I came to was that
it's not necessarily... That there's many
[SPEAKER_00]: modes of action that can cause this
turgidity in the leaf, many of which are
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial and many of which could be a
sign of plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my big takeaway was it's not
necessarily a good or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing a plant does in response to
certain environmental factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of which are beneficial, some of
which could be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need to throw you under the bus
or open a can of worms there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was a good chance to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to... Yeah, sometimes because
every grow is different and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil doctor cannot give me,
or you for that matter either,
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly a recipe for what my plants need
in my specific area at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also if you bring in somebody who's
way more knowledgeable, they can only do
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants don't have baseline health,
well, okay, there's like 10 steps we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to do before we even get to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to progress?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is there's no one gun
quiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no prescription that fits
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I have to take stuff that
people that are far more knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_01]: than me tell me with a grain of salt,
like this plant might have this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and this deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell because its leaves are
yellow, but that doesn't mean the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just actually means that we
underwatered it this last week and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see all this like, we'll sit there and
argue until we're blue in the face about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already taken a lot of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we could talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get you back on because I
just made a list of topics of things we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't even get to like fertility,
irrigation, drying, curing, genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: your marketing and branding, and also your
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things I would love to get a
little bit of insight from you on because
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you shared today was really
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and if that's the case, I'd love to
get the team on there because Sawyer,
[SPEAKER_01]: my IPM manager has now taken this,
picked up where I left off a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that I'm not involved in the
weekly meetings and conversations of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on, but Jared has taken the
soil prescriptions and the soil tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's taken it to the next level from where
I left off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Danny, obviously has always taken the
design engineering and innovative nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of facilities design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that him and I don't go back and
forth more than anyone on what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, but if we're going to do that,
I'm happy to bring on different members of
[SPEAKER_01]: the team or even parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Connor's done in my propagation
department, what Alejandro and Kyle have
[SPEAKER_01]: done for the leafing and harvest and
efficiencies and reducing touch points and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just all of them are,
I mean, if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: Connor takes more clones in a month than
I've ever taken in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, I've now grown, I guess,
I don't know if you don't necessarily give
[SPEAKER_01]: me credit for it, but tens of thousands of
pounds of weed, but I haven't taken a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do at my R&D shop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is each of my teammates or
team members have done each of their
[SPEAKER_01]: individual tasks a hundred times more than
me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that I do is keep tabs
and stay informed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to get in depth on any one
of those topics, I need to bring on the
[SPEAKER_01]: team, because that's how you evolve a
facility like this is by letting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just like any good business person
will tell you, you hire people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: better than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even saying all of them were
better, but they are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, you know, these guys are,
are, you know, like I said, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: snipers, they're rock stars and they've
got a lot of practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, but I would love to talk about like
the R&D facility because I do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cool breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, a lot of this other stuff is
kind of, it gets monotonous compliance and
[SPEAKER_01]: the world and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All people get into growing weed because
they think like, oh, I love weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, it's exciting and it's fun,
but like, there's still a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: repetition.
[SPEAKER_01]: My R&D facility, I still get excited about
going there every single morning and
[SPEAKER_01]: checking in and it's still fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still get to do the parts of the job
that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's hard to quantify or make that
facility pencil out, even though it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cheap to run, you know,
I might spend 150 or 200 grand a year
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, the salary, the power,
the rent, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts a smile on my face, just like
doing new breeding projects and making
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and, and seeing new phenos and,
and, and also it doesn't beat me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we had a hermy and that whole room got
seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's for blast it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, you know, versus catastrophic
failure in a large scale greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to continue this
conversation, but I would like to maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: bring on the individual team members to
give them their credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also so that you can actually go down
the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just even you can't keep track of every
single treatment and every single thing at
[SPEAKER_01]: this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can give you the overview and
the master calendar and I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, but my people have now really
taken it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's where you got to bring
them in or do like 15 minute segments with
[SPEAKER_01]: each person or something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to set that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been, it's been a pleasure
working with you over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know when we first
started talking, but getting to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: and see the facility, meet the team,
meet a lot of the people in the Bozeman
[SPEAKER_00]: area and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the community there when I came
out and the fact you were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gave tours and everything and really
opened it up to even competitors to come
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what you guys were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought was really, really commendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's a step in the right
direction too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a, right now we've got a living
soil Alliance here in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a, all of us living soil
growers trying to band together to educate
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers so that look, if you're
shopping at the co-op, but you don't care
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in your weed, you, you just don't
know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can educate the consumers to as far
as I'm concerned, and for a while we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to have that same mentality of like
secrets, let's keep everything guarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not tell everyone what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for after a while, it's like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, imitation is a form of
flattery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, if the whole world grew with
living soil, sun grown cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we'd all be better off from a carbon
footprint standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so would I be jealous about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no, I wouldn't might stay for a
second because someone copied you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then you're like, no, what's,
that's not what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all about like, sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my degrees are in conservation,
biology, natural resource, ecology,
[SPEAKER_01]: wilderness management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a wilderness ranger for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is a core tenant, a principle of
the foundation of this company was
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to forget that when you're
drowning in compliance and day-to-day and
[SPEAKER_01]: bookkeeping and all the nonsense,
but every once in a while, you do remember
[SPEAKER_01]: that like, man, that's a, that's a
founding principle of our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I'd love to do that
again, if you're ever back in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking about just doing that,
having like a living soil alliance day and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the same thing and opening up the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, it took the edge off for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our competitors were just competing
against each other, but like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all facing the same struggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's talk about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's liberating in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, here's the problems I have
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, here's a spot of mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I'm doing to address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I've done in the past to
address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not be like, don't tell anyone that I had
some mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and of course, as you know,
when you post that stuff online,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the closet growers come out in full
force about, I'd be more worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: that purple stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were you, it's like, ah, geez,
man, go back to your closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to do a good thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard for me not to take it
personally because I care so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the same time, like, you don't have
to worry about the chatter of the closet
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just do your best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but for us to like, uh, we've scaled
to this level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I know, far as I can tell,
we haven't lost a bit on our quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't think we can continue to
scale that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing we got to talk about is,
um, how many rooms you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently to have a high utilization
rate, like just the most efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most efficient facility design,
man, there's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anyways, we could talk about this
whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know you're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I super appreciate the time we
had today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I will, uh, absolutely reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate everything you do for
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also still use KISSO organics for our
veg soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have done some side-by-sides there
and we have a large ribbon mixer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that, um, as much as it's
stung, uh, your soil just tromped all over
[SPEAKER_01]: my soil when I was making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even like to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I begrudgingly say that, but props to you
for, and what you've done for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone here, everyone in Montana just
thinks so highly of what you've brought to
[SPEAKER_01]: the community just by this same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're educating us all by having these
awesome guests on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
