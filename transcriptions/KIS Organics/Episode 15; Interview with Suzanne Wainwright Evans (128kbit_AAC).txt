[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're enjoying these podcasts so far,
please take a moment to subscribe on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes or Stitcher or whatever platform
you're listening on and leave me a rating
[SPEAKER_00]: and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really helpful and allows me to
keep producing good content by drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the top names in the industry to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sign up for our newsletters on our
website at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send out a newsletter approximately
every two weeks, and this is the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure you know when the next podcast
has been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the latest discounts,
new product information, blog posts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's happening in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Suzanne Wainwright
Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a primary focus on biological control
and using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting to
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, nurseries, landscapers,
and interior scape companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, Suzanne is frequently
published in trade magazines and teaches
[SPEAKER_00]: her workshops and lectures professionally
to industry groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her lectures use an extensive libraries of
insect photos and macro insect movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually how I met Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really stole the show with her
presentation and I consider it a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: honor that she was willing to come on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has also spoken at the Smithsonian
Institute as well as appeared on Growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: Greener World on PBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the owner of Bug Lady Consulting,
now in business for over 16 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne lives in Pennsylvania with her
husband, one dog and eight cats and a log
[SPEAKER_00]: home built in the 1820s, which is where I
caught up with her for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you are a large scale commercial
cultivator and are serious about
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting or setting up an IPM program
utilizing beneficial insects, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend her enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her website is www.bugladyconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand though, if you're just
looking to get a few questions answered or
[SPEAKER_00]: have a small medical grow and no budget
for actual consulting, please try and
[SPEAKER_00]: attend one of her upcoming talks rather
than emailing her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a very generous person with her
time and wants to be able to help
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, but her consulting schedule is
very full and this is her livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assured her that she would not be
bonding by emails after this show as she
[SPEAKER_00]: is an incredibly busy person already.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a ton of information including her
upcoming events, articles she's written
[SPEAKER_00]: and much more on her website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we dive into this week's
podcast, I wanted to give listeners a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purposely kept the questions as general
as possible because as you will soon
[SPEAKER_00]: learn, with biological controls,
it's not as simple as this bug eats that
[SPEAKER_00]: bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other information you
need to know starting with proper
[SPEAKER_00]: identification and then looking at the
growth growing environment to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what bio controls will be most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to get an expert
with a background in entomology to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly utilize these beneficial and
predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for taking some
time today to chat with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are here with Suzanne Wainwright
Evans, also known as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Suzanne, can you give me a little bit
of a background into how you got into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and why bugs are so fascinating
to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really great to meet you in
person the other week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agreed to do this because I really
appreciate you wanting to get good
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific information out there and
getting good information to growers so
[SPEAKER_01]: they can manage their pest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my background, I decided in middle
school, I wanted to be an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was basically the path I set
myself on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the University of Florida
where I have degrees in entomology and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was in college, I worked in
the horticulture slash agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: industry doing many different jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in the industry over 25
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the last 16 years, I've worked for
myself as an independent insect consultant
[SPEAKER_01]: where I don't sell I do not sell
biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sell pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is basically to help growers put
together good pest management programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a little bit more focused on the
biocontrol options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have to understand pesticides and
how they work and compatibility with
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol agents because sometimes we
don't have biocontrol agents for some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do work within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've given talks at CannaCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just most recently heard you at
another conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that, though, you do a lot of
work outside of the cannabis industry with
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental crops and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit more about the
sorts of work that you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I work in generally what I say is I
work in everything but like soybeans and
[SPEAKER_01]: corn and big outdoor ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have customers that are aquaponics
producers where they're growing fish and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also work with some of the theme parks
dealing with insect pests in their
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape where they're open for the
majority of the day and they can't afford
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to come in and spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's the public perception of seeing
people in spray suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with large ornamental growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my growers, they produce four
million poinsettias a year and do a
[SPEAKER_01]: million hanging baskets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some large scale operations all the way
down to some smaller greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_01]: specialize maybe in edible flowers or
other specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to work with challenging
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually people end up at me when
they've tried everything else and are just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of struggling with controlling pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they hire me to come in and
basically figure out what's going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with a strategy on how to manage
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with a bit more of a focus on
biocontrol options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to emphasize is that
we talked a little bit off air before this
[SPEAKER_00]: and you had mentioned you'd only been home
for I think four weeks so far this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're obviously really busy and your
plate is full with consulting as it
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're listening to this podcast
and you are a large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grower or cultivator and you need to bring
someone in to help you, you would be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to potentially provide consulting for
that, but you probably don't have time for
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two emails from that guy with three
plants or five plants or a small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of resources would you
recommend for someone like that starting
[SPEAKER_00]: out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to consider using beneficial
insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And wouldn't necessarily fit into your
consulting schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's challenging because even some of the
small growers, small CSAs that are maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: just like an acre or so have the same kind
of challenges of how do you get current
[SPEAKER_01]: viable information for their business when
most publications they're targeting large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale commercial ag and that's where a lot
of the research is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes having a network of
other growers to reach out to is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important, but unfortunately what I've
seen within the cannabis industries is
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some bad information and it just
keeps getting perpetuated and perpetuated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cut and paste ability of the
internet and even on some of the Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where people are posting insects for
identification, you have people and I say
[SPEAKER_01]: this as nice as you can who are just not
qualified to being able to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: insects and I see people when they say
they're guessing, but they say it like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fact and growers are getting bad
information and misidentification.
[SPEAKER_01]: With being cannabis, you don't have the
options of reaching out to extensions
[SPEAKER_01]: where other people can't, but you can if
you do have an insect pest, you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: the insect just in alcohol and as long as
it's not on the plant material,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could get someone to identify it for
you through extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't mention host plant because once
they find out what the host plant is,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to be able to help you
because of all the money and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: knows the issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be some more resources
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing more of the traditional trade
journals and magazines that have focused
[SPEAKER_01]: on ornamental and vegetable greenhouse
production become more involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually contacted this week by one
of the trade publications that are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in doing, they want to talk to
me about doing an e-publication on pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management specifically for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has its own set of challenges
that some of the other industries don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have, but they have different challenges
that the cannabis people don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've looked around, resources are
pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some books available,
but I tell you, I've read through some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them and there's just some of the
information is good, but there's also bad
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard for me once I look at a
resource that I know has bad information,
[SPEAKER_01]: how am I to trust anything else that
resource says?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real challenge right now for small
cannabis growers to get good viable
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that some of the educational
conferences might provide some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity, but again, you have to look
at who's speaking, what their background
[SPEAKER_01]: is to qualify them to be speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've attended some sessions for people
that are, quote unquote, cannabis pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've seen bad information given out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had a better answer, but it's a
real challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like starting with an extension
service or a university is a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you brought up with consultants
is a good point that anyone can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant if they want to slap that title
behind their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no requirements for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges also with that is
that these consultants, while they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good list of customers or clients
that they're working with, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean that what they're doing
is optimal or the most successful option
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that leads me to where do you like
people to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into a new facility or a new
situation, what is the first thing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where you like to always start
when it comes to these bug problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have to know what you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, insect ID is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of guessing and a lot of
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some insects are easier to identify than
others, but some can be extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips is a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to identify immature thrips will
melt your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to be able to see adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you do have to slide mount them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to spread their wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody posts a picture online of an
immature thrips and everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's this, it's that, it's this,
it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to college for seven years for this
and I've been doing this for 25 years and
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how all these people
magically know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens is people have gotten
bad identifications and pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: options have not worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do go in, we spend quite a bit of
time on identifying what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to know what you've been doing
as far as what you've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something should have worked and didn't
work, we spend a fair amount of time on
[SPEAKER_01]: troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had this problem, this should have
controlled it, but it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying it didn't work is not good
enough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get in there and find out what
went wrong so that we can correct the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem and either not do that again or
correct it so it does work because
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it can be applicator error,
whether it be bios or spray products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be the rates were wrong,
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a whole list of things that can
go wrong when you're trying to treat for
[SPEAKER_01]: pest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring out how we got there is really
critical when I get into a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing, because these are live
living organisms, there's a chance they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be coming in stressed as well or
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you talked about was
identification of the quality of the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're buying or purchasing and
making sure that they're arriving in a
[SPEAKER_00]: state where they're going to want to eat
whatever pest problem you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've taught some workshops with
some, I will call them co-workers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they don't work for me, but they're
industry people that I trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taught a couple times now around the
country how to assess the quality of your
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, being a grower and what you have
available equipment-wise and testing-wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is kind of limited, but there are some
quick down and dirty things that growers
[SPEAKER_01]: can do just to double check.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, being in this industry for
many, many years now, the quality has
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know so much more now than we've did
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's constantly evolving, getting better
at shipping, better at ventilation on
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, but one of the most critical
things, and anybody that knows me knows
[SPEAKER_01]: this, I think it is so important for your
biocontrol agents to be shipped to you
[SPEAKER_01]: directly from the insectary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If distributors want to sell product,
that's fine, but I don't like when product
[SPEAKER_01]: goes from an insectary to a distributor,
they repackage or they stick their label
[SPEAKER_01]: on it and they reship out because that
adds extra shipping time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's more time for the temperature
to fluctuate within the shipping process
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want to keep those biocontrol
agents at their consistent temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, until you're going to warm them
up and to be ready to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen situations with product that
have been sold through to distributors,
[SPEAKER_01]: not drop shipped, but through distributors
where the product has not been so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also seen emails saying, hey,
we've got extra product this week and
[SPEAKER_01]: offering it a discount, but when those
insects are stressed or dead or been
[SPEAKER_01]: cannibalized, it's not going to do you a
lot of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important to get from
a good quality supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be challenging because from being
in grows and stuff, a lot of people just
[SPEAKER_01]: like to go online, order stuff and pay
through it through PayPal, but the key
[SPEAKER_01]: insectaries that sell to the US,
you just can't go order on their website
[SPEAKER_01]: and pay with PayPal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more set up in a traditional
purchasing system where you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: contact the insectary and set up an
account with them, which they do take
[SPEAKER_01]: credit cards, but I think that you're
going to get a better quality product
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get better information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it can be challenging if you are a
hobbyist growers because you typically
[SPEAKER_01]: need much smaller amounts and some of the
insectaries do have minimum orders and
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be a situation where you may have
to use a distributor, but you've just got
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay on top and making sure that
product is a quality product before you go
[SPEAKER_01]: out because again, there's no point in
spending the money and then the time of
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not going to do what they need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were a let's just say hobby
grower, that's a good term for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing as much about insects as you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a company out there that they
could potentially call up and place a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller order if they can't go directly to
an insectary?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the same note, if I was a
larger facility, a commercial grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: got a recommendation from you or someone
else that's knowledgeable, would I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up an account directly with an
insectary?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing about the cannabis industry
is I have to say you guys are pretty tight
[SPEAKER_01]: knit and you guys visit each other's
grows, which we can talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and back in the early days,
like, you know, 20 years ago when back
[SPEAKER_01]: then I actually did sell biocontrol agents
before we learned I'm a terrible sale
[SPEAKER_01]: salesperson.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what some of my greenhouse people
would do down in Florida is to help save
[SPEAKER_01]: on shipping is they pull their order all
together and they would come to one
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and then people just drive over,
pick their stuff up and take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you guys do, you know,
you have your friends around that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: also grow, you talk to each other,
you know, they could you guys could pull
[SPEAKER_01]: your order together and then you'd be able
to meet some of these minimum orders from
[SPEAKER_01]: insectaries and be able to just do it that
way is one of option.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, and I don't know the
exact minimum orders for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: insectaries, but I do think beneficial
insectary, I don't think their minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: order is too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, you are going to be paying
overnight freight on this on these
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very frustrating to people when
they're spending $40 on on bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then, you know, $50 on shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have to look at the price of
shipping as part of the biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, your pricing on shipping is
going to depend on where you're located
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, how much you're actually
getting and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes whether you buy one bottle
or six bottles, your shipping might be the
[SPEAKER_01]: same because, you know, there's that
basically the way they're doing more
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping today, it's based on,
you know, the size of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so oftentimes, and I'll tell my
growers to do too, is talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, you know, you're ordering two
bottles of persimilis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask them how much it is to just go ahead
and fill out the rest of that box because
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out extra is not necessarily going
to hurt anything and just spending a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more money to get things super
duper cleaned up might be worth the time
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're paying the shipping anyhow
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best thing to do is is look at
your needs, contact an insectary and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what their minimum order is for where you
are and see if they can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, there are smaller distributors
that will break down these larger orders
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you do sometimes can run the
risk of the product being a day or two
[SPEAKER_01]: older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've got a food source, you know,
they tend to do okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like sachets can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get into some of the
predatory mites that don't have food,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can impact the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially again, if you get that
warming and cooling and any condensation
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bottle, that can really be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I realize we just kind of dove right
in without ever talking about exactly why
[SPEAKER_00]: this is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spend a lot of time on it
because I think a lot of our listeners are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why are we really using biocontrols?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this industry so important in such
a solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know for me, when I first found
out about people using beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was initially pretty skeptical of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I didn't realize how much there
was to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I started out thinking,
okay, you have this bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with two spod mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I get this is the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not realizing that there were all
these other factors like lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and temperature and so much more
that went into choosing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insect to deal with the right
pest to make sure it was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure there's a lot of people
out there buying the wrong insects for the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong pest and wasting a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, do you want to touch on that just
a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk about let's talk
about overall agriculture as a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, cannabis now is part of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one driving force behind the
use of biocontrol agents is because people
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot manage their pests with spray
products anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their resistance to chemical pesticides is
a very big factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like how people have taken too
many antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now a lot of the diseases that
humans get are resistant to antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact same thing has happened with a
lot of these key pests like aphids and
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips and two spod spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had so much exposure to chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say, oh, they mutate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selecting for insects and mites
that are able basically to metabolize the
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide and it doesn't kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or people use what is called a sublethal
dose where the pests are exposed to lower
[SPEAKER_01]: doses of a product and it doesn't kill
them, but it allows them to build up
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's very dangerous when
people are like, well, I don't really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to spray chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to, you know,
use a real low rate below what's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: label because that really contributes to
having the pests resistant to these
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what has happened again, you know,
two spotted spider mites, white flies,
[SPEAKER_01]: western flower thrips, aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you look at two spotted spider
mites, they're resistant to 95 different
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries now because of exposure to
chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been overall in agriculture,
the driving force is because they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: manage them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get calls from growers saying,
well, I care about the drinking water and
[SPEAKER_01]: I care about, no, it's, oh my gosh,
I can't control these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really is what has gotten the
ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what has happened too is there are
things called MRLs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are maximum residue levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're looking at with
produce now where, okay, yes, this
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical is legal to spray on this
vegetable, but you can only have so much
[SPEAKER_01]: of that chemical on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't just spray that chemical over
and over and over again, even though it's
[SPEAKER_01]: legal to be applied there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are looking to break up their
spray programs by using these biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: agents so they don't spray as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the cannabis industry can be like,
well, hey, you know, we haven't been using
[SPEAKER_01]: these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, our pest problems
shouldn't be resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, come on, you guys all know
the chemicals you guys have been spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's pretty horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you laughing because you know what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, growers would contact me 10 years
ago, you know, and hey, I'm growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got spider mites, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was no concern for human
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it was out of malicious
lit-ness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was out of just ignorance of not
understanding you know, combustion of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, concentrations of pesticides
into oils off of plants and the impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's actually regulatory rules by
the states for which chemicals you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're not using avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not using fluoromite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is what is the rest of the
agricultural community using?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if the ornamental guy down the
way is doing a rotation of avid and
[SPEAKER_01]: fluoromite and hexagon and ovation and he
develops resistance, if those two spots,
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites, do get into your grow,
they already have that resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you may have not have used
those chemicals, you have a resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we have had a major problem
controlling this particular white fly
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, believe it or not,
the problem actually originated in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they overused chemistries there to
where the white flies were resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that population of white flies got
into the United States and it spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you may not be spraying the
chemicals, the pest population you have
[SPEAKER_01]: may have been exposed to it through
multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they can be resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to state the obvious here,
I assume you're getting good results when
[SPEAKER_00]: people are following a proper biocontrol
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to control or eradicate some
of these pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, destroy the word eradicate
from your vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no such thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, you know, back in the 80s and 90s,
the chemical guys would talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: eradicating pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when they talk about pest management,
they talk about suppressing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: being below an economic threshold because
you're not going to be able to eradicate
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing a plant that's pretty darn
clean and, you know, you're not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: pest issues and you're not seeing damage
because eradication, it just does not
[SPEAKER_01]: happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had two-spotted mites or thrips
or brood aphids, whatever pest in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor facility, let's say, so a more
controlled environment, we should assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that those will always be there for the
life of the facility or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for multiple crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very possible, you know, especially
if you have any kind of hydroponic system
[SPEAKER_01]: set up, if you're using any kind of NFT or
where your ebb and flood benches,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially brood aphids, you're just going
to spread them and spread them and spread
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it takes is one being left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the cannabis industry,
they don't have some of the, I will air
[SPEAKER_01]: quote, stronger chemistries that can
really knock back a pest issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys just don't have it as an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your best thing to do is not get the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest, I think the cat's out of
the bag on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've just spread all their
problems far and wide between everybody at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that we're seeing
are a lot of problems with people sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or spreading pests back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sorts of things do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic, common sense things that you
think every grower should be doing when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to getting in new genetics or even
just basic bio controls around the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every time you bring new plant
material into a facility, it is a gamble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still trying to wrap our hands
around exactly all the pest problems you
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, you know, new pests are
popping up that, you know, it's not that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't say, well, we didn't think it'd
be on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just didn't think about it being on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's turning out to be cannabis is a
pretty good host for a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we're seeing more industrial
hemp being grown outside, we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: learning more about which pests attack it,
which are a lot of your common
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moving right over from,
you know, vegetable and grain production
[SPEAKER_01]: right into cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if you can not bring stuff
in, which I know is because you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get new genetics, you know, that's how
people are getting problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hemp russet mites are not a
government conspiracy that the government
[SPEAKER_01]: is breeding and blowing at your laughing
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know people believe that it's not
part of a weed biocontrol program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's not even a mite that's
close to the hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get hemp russet mite because somebody
brought it in on a plant on plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: or their clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of been a little self it's
self done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were to build my ideal greenhouse
today, I would definitely have a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantine facility where you would hold
all new plant material just to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not coming in with any pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that dipping cuttings is
going to be the best way to stop new new
[SPEAKER_01]: things from coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ornamental industry is really starting
to embrace this technology of dipping
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you get 100 percent coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say you're going to
eradicate every single pest on there 100
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, but you can get pretty
significant knockback.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a practice that even people that have
their own stock mother plants in their
[SPEAKER_01]: facility are when they take those
cuttings, they're dipping them before they
[SPEAKER_01]: stick them, even even in-house stuff,
just to stop that constant cycle of of
[SPEAKER_01]: these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, having quarantine facilities
keeping things isolated, dipping cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just it's all about sanitation
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis people just need to learn more
about sanitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get an opportunity to ever,
I recommend for cannabis people,
[SPEAKER_01]: go tour some of the ornamental production
facilities that are doing things like
[SPEAKER_01]: geraniums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go in and touch plants with
your bare hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have sanitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you know, use alcohol,
things like that to make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, not all ornamental facilities
have quarantines and do all the right
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but they have more options to clean
their products up and their pests they're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with may not completely destroy
their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis crop value is much higher
per plant than ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's just you can afford to
throw away, you know, 10 pansy plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford to do that in a cannabis
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, human transmission, I think,
is really something that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at because most people that work at
a facility grow at home and it's very easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to transport those pests back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to a grow facility or you have
guests visiting, you know, have they been
[SPEAKER_01]: at any other grows that day because if
they were in an infested grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: they swipe their sleeve up against a
plant, can pick up pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is potential for them that if
possible, if they brush up against another
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know, they could spread it,
spread insects and mites that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chances of it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody's looked at the,
you know, the exact risk of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could definitely happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so protocols of, you know,
tie back suits, you know, lab coats,
[SPEAKER_01]: hand washing stations, all that stuff,
I think is so critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't see those kinds of things
at the cannabis facilities being
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your ideal facility, you'd have no
one doing home grows and I assume no one
[SPEAKER_00]: going from another grow back to your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have to go home, shower,
change clothes or address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have foot baths in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think those are useful?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how you're growing,
you know, places that have cement floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a place this last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have eaten off their floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so meticulous and the chances of
a pathogen being able to survive in those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it depends on the pathogen are
much slimmer than those that have little
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt piles and or on gravel or outdoor
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say, you know, I'm not a
pathologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, the disease person
department to look at what the risk is for
[SPEAKER_01]: disease transmission where I'm more
dealing with insect issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, you know, the tobacco mosaic
virus, you know, a lot of people say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well, you know, I plant, you know,
you can see some of the symptoms in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but I'm still getting my same
amount of harvest, I think is a very risky
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude to have because then if you are
taking cuttings off of those plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: then repropagating, you know, we don't
want to be spreading a virus, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: through all the plants out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know really if there's been
enough looked at the long term impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: this virus on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what if you have a secondary problem
that those two problems then could
[SPEAKER_01]: complete?
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely stress the plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So smoking is something that, you know,
has to be looked at because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do some reading on tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not exactly my department because
it's mechanically transmitted by hands and
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think that's a risk you
need to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most vegetable production
facilities do not allow their employees to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke because of potential virus
transmission from cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you actually seen lab results showing
tobacco mosaic virus in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have you heard of it being
transferred from cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I have seen pictures of the plants
that they and I did not physically see the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going on them saying that the report
came back positive for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that situation, because,
you know, I can't be all places at all
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm in Pennsylvania where
cannabis is just starting over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can get those ELISA test kits like
from AgDia that you can do that quick
[SPEAKER_01]: first initial virus testing in house to
see if you do get a positive before paying
[SPEAKER_01]: to send it off for further virus testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a quick way to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because it could be nutritional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be cultural.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least it's a quick way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to other people in the
cannabis industry, and I will say they
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to know what they're talking about,
that this is a concern for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be interesting to see what
happens with more of the hemp being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors in traditional tobacco states to
see if it becomes an issue for outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: production as well on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just something to keep an eye out
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't have the answers for
everything because this is such a new,
[SPEAKER_01]: new developing industry and there just
hasn't been a lot of research on it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does from the report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, once you get into virology
testing and stuff, you know, you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive for one virus when it can be
another virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets very complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think it's something we need to
watch for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's all part of SAMHSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you touched on is that these
pests seem to be opportunistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned plant stress being a
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of a factor is plant stress in
terms of a lot of these pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you say stress, you know,
there's this race to push the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is not this is just not
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They push the plants, want them to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast, they want them to be dark green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want nice big blooms or buds on
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a lot of supportive research
now on ornamental and vegetable crops that
[SPEAKER_01]: when you push these plants to grow and the
plants are actually growing at a faster
[SPEAKER_01]: rate, the plants can't can't produce a lot
of their natural defensive chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the plants natural defenses
chemicals that includes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeine, nicotine, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are built in insecticides,
pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're busy growing, you can't
produce as many chemicals and you become
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done work looking at roses and
chrysanthemums, and they've actually found
[SPEAKER_01]: by reducing parts per million of nitrogen,
it can have significant impact on spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mite population and western flower thrips
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something in ornamentals that
we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're still we have to grow on a
schedule because you got to get those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out for Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have the poinsettias out in
time for Christmas sales and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at can we lower nitrogen
levels to where we can help suppress some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these plants, you know, some of the
pest pressures, but still grow a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: quality plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with cannabis, you know,
it's it's, you know, more is not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to be the motto of this
industry of just dumping every a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think this is something that
needs to be looked at is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we can adjust fertilization to can
still get your same amount of harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: but reduce your pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes research and it takes someone
willing to do the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that's still not going
to be done on a government university
[SPEAKER_01]: extension level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a growing facility that's willing
to take the time to do that and to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand research and how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a question I'm really curious
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot of people correlating BRICS
levels with pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any information on that in
terms of the sugar content in the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow making a plant less interesting to
a particular pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't have too much comment on it
because usually, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about BRICS stuff, usually talking
about fruit production because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to look at the sugars that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was an interesting study done,
University of Maryland, and I believe it
[SPEAKER_01]: was Dr. Mike Rupp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go back and look, but they were
looking at brown marmorated stink bug,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, we're seeing in cannabis
hanging out and feeding on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked on trees, ornamental trees in
the landscape where the brown marmorated
[SPEAKER_01]: stink bugs were feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this and it's, you know,
I don't want this job, but somebody does
[SPEAKER_01]: this job where they actually can when an
insect is feeding, you can almost,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can basically cut off their mouth
parts and then it works basically as a
[SPEAKER_01]: needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you can collect from the end
of the broken off mouth part where exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the insect was feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do this like with aphids to see what
they're feeding on, what part of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and the sugar content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that brown marmorated stink
bug knew exactly on trees where to tap
[SPEAKER_01]: into higher sugar levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so them in the plants and that's what
they head for because sugar content in a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is not evenly distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's something that's starting to
be looked at, but I don't have an exact
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific answer with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be anecdotal, there may be
something to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, you know, you're pushing one plant
to do one thing, then it typically can't
[SPEAKER_01]: do another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only do so much at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it does appear that when you have a
room of plants, the most stressed plant
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the first one that you'll see
pests on unless you have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really, really,
really critical for the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: to be tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we're growing these these 10
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, number nine always seems to
be the first with a spider mite outbreak
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to be noted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people need to be sharing that
information so that even though,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe it has some other great
qualities, you know, selecting for
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that have more resistance
issues, resistance, resistance issues is
[SPEAKER_01]: the right word, but resistance to them so
that maybe you may give up some other
[SPEAKER_01]: little quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But selecting for plants that don't have
pest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saw that in chrysanthemum production,
there's a variety called Viron.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a you want Western flower thrips,
you grow that variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most commercial growers do not grow it
anymore because it is so prone to Western
[SPEAKER_01]: flower thrips, even though it has a nice
flower to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what ended up happening is people
actually use it as a trap plant where they
[SPEAKER_01]: would put it in the middle of their other
moms and it would actually draw the
[SPEAKER_01]: Western flower thrips right to the Viron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would bag the Viron and get rid
of the plant and they would actually pull
[SPEAKER_01]: the pests out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a definite correlation between
stress and cultivar deciding on,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, who's going to get fed on and who's
not going to get fed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen, well, I want to come back
to the indicator trap plant and pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, I just want to touch on
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've heard there were some studies,
I've read some studies on seaweed helping
[SPEAKER_00]: with insect resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any research or read
anything on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that, I mean, so,
you know, seaweeds have cytokinins in them
[SPEAKER_01]: and that from what I've seen in personal
experiences, it does definitely help with
[SPEAKER_01]: overall plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen, and this is also where when
you look at research, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically look at how the research was
done and who did the research and where
[SPEAKER_01]: was it published and is it peer reviewed
because, you know, you've got the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing today of, you know, pay to publish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could have some really bad
science, but you can pay a journal to
[SPEAKER_01]: publish it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean it's actually good
sound science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you got to be very
careful with reading some of the stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: the sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also look how the experiments are
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: One example of, you know, people were
looking at silicon because there was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you use silicon, it thickens the
cuticle, and then you don't have as many
[SPEAKER_01]: pest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was some initial work done
where they put silicon on plants and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they looked at mealybugs on them,
but they saw no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem was is the crop they
were using was not a silicon accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see this that just because you use
something on one plant doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get the same results on another
plant because plants are picky about what
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients they're going to uptake and in
what form and in what quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is where maybe seaweed
may work in some situations, and some even
[SPEAKER_01]: some medias, but may not in another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you've got to have a control when
you do the test to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something not environmental or something
else that's causing the results that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a book called Seaweed and Plant
Growth by T.L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sen, which was a collection of research
articles that he sort of he sort of went
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember reading about it,
but I'll have to go back and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do bring up a really good point
that we try and emphasize in just about
[SPEAKER_00]: every podcast that people do need to have
a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to look at an actual study and
see how it was how it was established and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it was set up and make sure the
methodology fits with what they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all really good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, though, I would love to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I know we talked about a
little bit when we met was about neem and
[SPEAKER_00]: neem oil and how you mentioned it was not
your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch a little bit on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying neem oil is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put that out there because I don't
want to get all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hate emails, you know, but from my
personal experience doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, oils are not oils are not
oils are not oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a reason you cook with
Wesson oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason we use, you know,
different kinds of oils for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: makeup and there's different kinds of oils
than that we use for pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's particle size difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They some of them, you know, are mixed
better into water than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some that do better in
certain, you know, spray equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't cause clogging.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with neem oil is people like,
oh, you know, it's from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're crunchy granolas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate the petroleum industry,
so I don't want to use petroleum based
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have petroleum based
products, you better stop driving your car
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, heating your house and,
you know, drinking out of that plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, petroleum is part
of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great if it wasn't the way it
is, but that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because something is a plant based
product does not mean it is always safe
[SPEAKER_01]: for humans, always safe for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's a big
misconception that people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: think that just because it's plant based,
it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not saying neem is not safe,
but neem is a product that is regulated by
[SPEAKER_01]: our government and it has to be
registered, you know, and have an EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: registration number on the product because
of its insecticidal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my concern comes in is we know neem
is a good repellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some good research out of Purdue
looking at neem as a repellent for like
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they spray a plant with neem,
they have another plant they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed with neem, and sure enough,
the Japanese beetles tend to pass up a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more the plant with the neem on it because
it has a repelling quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you spray that on a plant and you
want to release biocontrol agents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, you've got to look at each
individual biocontrol agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say it with a broad sweeping
blanket, but there's a chance you can
[SPEAKER_01]: repel your beneficials off the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen biocontrol agents just go to the
stems and walk down and march off plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't want to live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some research done where they
have sprayed plant material foliage with
[SPEAKER_01]: neem and then put some of the predatory
mites on there and the predatory mites
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to leave because of the repelling
quality on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not going to use biocontrol
at all, sure, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think you're going to be using
biocontrol agents, you better think about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're growing outside where
you've got rain, overhead irrigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: UV light, stuff's going to break down a
lot faster, but most people are not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing in a protected environment
where they're not overhead irrigating and
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds tend to persist for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really know because there hasn't
been a ton of work done on this yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is just something if my grower has
the option and they're using bios between
[SPEAKER_01]: using neem or a product like Sufoil-X,
I prefer them to use the Sufoil-X because
[SPEAKER_01]: once that's dry, we found that the
predatory mites do extremely well on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we don't get that repelling
quality with the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sufoil-X, you've got to look at your state
and see if it's approved in your state or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's approved down in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an OMRI-listed product, so it's
approved for use in organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being used in vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an oil that I very rarely see
phytotoxicity with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, back to neem,
neem is not neem is not neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different producers of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to pick a product,
you really need to learn that product and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it and know how to use it in
your growing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen huge differences,
like over 1,000 ppm difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: azadractin levels across different neem
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it was such a repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Sufoil-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I looked into this after the first
time you mentioned it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough product for most people to
get their hands on unless they are a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your alternative, you mentioned,
was the Monterey Garden Horticultural Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it was the same or similar
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one people should be able to source
and find even on Amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which brings us back to dunking your
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw myself under the bus
and say when I brought some clones home,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were already in small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in soil already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to treat them because I didn't
know if they had something on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dunked them in a five-gallon bucket that
I had filled with neem oil and green
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner combination at 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to get your thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even dunked the soil, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants took it fine, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put them under a lot of light
right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I'll let you cover what I did
wrong and why you think this is a terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, what do you recommend for people
that are bringing in plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people are not passing clones
like they do in the ornamental industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's just the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually in rock wool or it's in peat
or some sort of media already.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is hard is when you have products and
you don't have a good dip rate because
[SPEAKER_01]: when you look at the research on dips,
dip rate is lower typically than spray
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until somebody has figured out what that
rate by dipping them in there and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant out and make sure there's no
negative impact, you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are dealing with mixing up just a
small quantity of a pesticide,
[SPEAKER_01]: a small error can be a big error.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was research done out of Canada
looking at dips with SulfoilX.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that for the ornamental market
currently, there is not a dip label yet
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the research has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This spray rate for the Sulfoil is
typically one to two percent where the dip
[SPEAKER_01]: rate is 0.1 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge difference from spraying to
dipping where they felt they got good
[SPEAKER_01]: enough pest control without causing phyto
on a phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do keep in mind, you can have
phytotoxicity that is not visible to the
[SPEAKER_01]: human eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants can be stressed and it can impact
their growth without us actually seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: burning or curling or spots or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I always do when we start talking
about dipping is we look at what the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is and what your target pest is to see
what dips are out there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have to be careful with any kind of
oil and dipping roots because there is
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for phytotoxicity on the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it comes back to product and rates
and temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your plant stressed even before you
dip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you soak it too long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a dip, it's not a soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to look at all these factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some of the other pests, dipping in a
botanogard is something that's being done
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dip in soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you go look at the labels and look
for the dip rates, you can find these
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with the botanogard, which again,
that's a whole nightmare because down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, you can't use botanogard,
but you can use botanogard max.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have a high enough
concentration of various spores really to
[SPEAKER_01]: do what you need to do for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting, unfortunately, very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying that you can mix products for
dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's best to look at what your target
pests are, what your plant is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to find the right dip for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to do some testing and to
grow out plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do dip, monitor those plants all
the way through their life cycle and see
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do notice anything in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dipping is the way that many greenhouse
people are stopping pests from getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea that the dip rates could
vary that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did it, I think I used the low end
of the spray rate and I didn't let it
[SPEAKER_00]: saturate the soil to really get into the
root zone, but I didn't know what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about some of the
products that you may or may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is
important for people to realize in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is that products that aren't EPA
regulated, whereas certain ones are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use Neem as an example of that,
they're claiming to be plant washes or
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf shine products as a way of getting
around having to do or not having the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get registered with the EPA as
a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any experience or do you have
any thoughts first off on plant wash or
[SPEAKER_00]: plant shine products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little about some of the
products you may have used or seen other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers use over the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gamble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using products that have not been vetted
is a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like going down to the
farmers market and buying herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say herbal medicine, I'm not
talking about cannabis, but you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supplements because it's not
regulated, so you don't really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: truly you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you can break things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your government registered
products, which will have an EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: registration number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will include, again, your Neem
products, your Azadirachtin products,
[SPEAKER_01]: your synthetic pesticides, insecticidal
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have what's called the 25B list.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are products that basically the
government said several years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, we know these products are pretty
much food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make your pesticides fungicides,
insecticides, miticides, whatever out of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, we are not going to require you to
pay the millions of dollars to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: registered, but that doesn't mean the
products work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means as a grower, you're just not
going to kill yourself or your employees
[SPEAKER_01]: by using these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a lot of food based products,
but there's no testing really or no
[SPEAKER_01]: vetting through any kind of agency for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the, well, we're just going
to not make pesticidal claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go with, we're calling it a
wash kind of thing, which you guys all
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's been going on with the plant
washes, what they're finding in them,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're finding in some of these
other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are lying and they're adding other
pesticides into them to make their
[SPEAKER_01]: products work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are willing to take those risks and
possibly lose a crop because of pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, that's a risk some people
are willing to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they understand that on
these 25B products, there's nothing to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like proof of them working or any testing
or really anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be these 25B products that can
be good products, but most of them are all
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: How well can you spray and cover your
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can suffocate it with an
oil, most likely you can kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always know what's in these
bottles you're getting unless you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: are having them tested to make sure of
what they're claiming is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, there have been too many
incidences now of these plant washes or
[SPEAKER_01]: even some of the 25B products where people
have knowingly put pesticides in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: make them work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, the stuff oil we
just talked about, it used to be sold
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago at a very dilute rate called
Clean and Shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a plant cleaner and they would
spray down a lot of the tropicals to wash
[SPEAKER_01]: off pesticide residues and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rate is so low as a fuller
application, it really didn't have those
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticidal properties where you need to
be at the 1% to 2% concentration of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product and see the insecticidal
properties from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complete gamble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a product that is not EPA
registered, I would first of all have it
[SPEAKER_01]: tested for any other pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, cannabis is too expensive
of a crop to take a risk on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'd want to only test a plant,
have a control next to it just to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you aren't going to have any
phytotoxicity or other weird things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's happening a lot with these
exempt products is when you have three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four plants and you can get such good
spray coverage the water is doing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what's happening is that people
that just have a few plants or plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are well spaced and that are in those
plants looking over every inch every day,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they spray, I think the water is
actually washing a certain percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pests off the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually a study done,
I think it was last year or the year
[SPEAKER_01]: before, where they looked at western
flower thrips and by getting good spray
[SPEAKER_01]: water coverage they were actually able to
pretty much knock thrips back to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: of conventional insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were at the same level, but they were
able to get in there and get spray
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage on every single leaf and really
baby those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in some of these products they have
surfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surfactants are soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like you're spraying the
plant too with an insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the physical action of washing
plus having a surfactant in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I think that's what's providing
a lot of the control, not actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with one of my ornamental larger
growing operations, we actually had them
[SPEAKER_01]: order in, and I don't want to get into
brand names, but some of the more air
[SPEAKER_01]: quote popular cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sprayed them like we would
regularly spray in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do that wand where you get under
every leaf because the reality is in
[SPEAKER_01]: larger commercial growing operations you
can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we sprayed them and we actually did
dipping too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a lot of phytotoxicity and we
really didn't get the control that was
[SPEAKER_01]: claimed by the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The commercial ornamental people and
vegetable guys, they're not adopting a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these products because we just don't
see the efficacy with it because they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't spray like the cannabis people can
spray and baby each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be interesting when you spray
a brand name product, then I would spray
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant with a surfactant and then
have your control and see if you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a control with just spraying water
and see what kind of results you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please, please, please stop spraying
with paint sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand this trend either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paint sprayers are not pesticide
applicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the nozzles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think investing in a good piece of you
can get the right particle size,
[SPEAKER_01]: the angled nozzles and all that kind of
stuff is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why people have these
plants with so much money and they baby
[SPEAKER_01]: them so much and then they cheap out using
a paint sprayer to spray their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a recommendation on that
end, like an atomizer or a fogger or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is when you talk to a
company that produces spray product for
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a greenhouse producer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a field producer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get the right equipment for
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that the different tips
which this is really where you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: specifics on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think DRAM is an excellent company that
produces really good equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much the company that most
commercial growers have their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see DRAM equipment all the time in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, depending on how you're
spraying and what you're spraying and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing, it can all be very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we buy their hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great success with that company
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're nice people and they're
smart people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kurt Becker plug out to that guy and don't
bombard him with emails, you know,
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he is so knowledgeable on spray
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever get the opportunity to hear
Kurt talk, it is, you know, I always learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from him and and he is he really knows his
stuff and he's not a bullshitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I allowed to swear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to give me the beef over
that when you go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I give all these the explicit rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no like 12 year old kids trying
to learn how to grow cannabis on a side
[SPEAKER_00]: note, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a I have a greenhouse and we
grow a variety of different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year I got mites, which I did not
do the right thing and fully identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't plan on treating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to let the crop go anyway
at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is overwintering in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for growers that are growing cannabis,
and have the ability to just open up that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in the winter and let let it
freeze or let temperatures drop down to to
[SPEAKER_00]: lower conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that even make any difference in the
life cycle for a lot of these pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all depends on the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you have cement floors or do you
have gravel floors where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're gravel where they can get down
lower and can be protected, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: different than a cement floor,
which is going to be naked and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be exposed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, how cold can you really get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just say this somehow miraculously
outside, you know, pests overwinter every
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, even in some of the harshest
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference between outside and in
a greenhouse is outside, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: days get shorter, temperatures start
dropping and all the animals, birds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, deer, insects, mice all get
their cue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to prepare for winter,
depending on the insect or might they all
[SPEAKER_01]: overwinter differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are eggs, some are pupa, some are
adult, and some can handle cooler
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough thing to do to really freeze
out pests completely, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to bring them right
back in on your plant material in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my concern also was that we have
some straw bales in there and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering if I'm contaminating those straw
bales with these mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a concern?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they going to feed on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you think about mites,
they don't have a hard exoskeleton like
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles to help from desiccation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bring home a bean leaf with
spider mites on it, which just reminded me
[SPEAKER_01]: of spider mites in the refrigerator I
forgot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crap, they're probably dead by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bring home a leaf with some spider
mites on it and, you know, put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: petri dish and see how long those mites
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hardy, but they're not hardy when
they don't have good environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think plant debris is more of an issue,
but two-spot spider mites are not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go, oh, look, I want to live in a straw
hay bale where there's no food source for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't overwinter, just go dormant or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about their life
cycle, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do a little research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the two-spot spider mites for
outside go into what's called diapause,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they start turning more pumpkiny,
orangish in the fall, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: overwinter in that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, forest greenhouse, you don't
get those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with aphids, aphids feed on
one plant, but they overwinter on an
[SPEAKER_01]: alternate host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to know your pest,
and you've got to understand its life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you bring up aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having an edible nursery on our
property as well, we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants, and I always get aphids
on our nasturtiums every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it was explained to me,
the life cycle of an aphid, part of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: that these ants will farm them as a way of
getting more of that sugary substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had a name for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The honeydew, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought there was a predatory
wasp that was eating the aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from your talk, I got the impression
that was actually wrong when you spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, parasitic wasps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a parasitic wasp because we kind of
break down into predators and parasites,
[SPEAKER_01]: where predators tend to, you know,
they're more like lace wings and ladybird
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles that eat them, where the parasites
are parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm sticking my egg in you and
I'm going to, you know, eat you from the
[SPEAKER_01]: inside out kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with aphids, there are many of those
parasitic wasps available for sale,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you've got to get the right parasite
for the right aphid pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to know what aphid you're
dealing with, and then you have to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a commercially available
parasitic wasp for it, then get it and be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would I be better off just hosing that
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice the wasp was landing on those
things, but it never really got ahead,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, of my aphid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would put diatomaceous earth out as
a way of helping control the ants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is another thing I wanted to talk to
you about was DE.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of treating aphids,
is just water the best option there in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of just hosing them off the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what aphid species you have,
because I mean, normally on nasturtiums,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see like black bean aphids,
which is not something I have heard of in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want to say it could never
be there, but you know, that's a different
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also depends on your economic
threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, plants can have a low level of
aphids, and it's not the end of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for outdoor production,
or if you're growing nasturtiums just for
[SPEAKER_01]: their bloom, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I grow nasturtiums, I let aphids
get on there, and they don't, for my
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape, it's not a problem,
because there's enough predators that come
[SPEAKER_01]: in the surface like aphid flies,
and you know, ladybird beetle larvae,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's enough things that feed on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, in a greenhouse situation,
we don't really want them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, you can do physical action of
washing them off with water, but
[SPEAKER_01]: nasturtiums, they tend to be on the
underside of the leaf, and it's harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: get water coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta, you know, have an angled wand
kind of to spray underneath on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a greenhouse, you know,
we typically are using more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: parasites to manage them, because the
parasites can fly around the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: and find that one aphid that's tucked away
over in the corner that you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the advantage to using the
parasites, is they can fly around and find
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you mentioned these different
plants, we talked a little about trap
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and indicator plants, and maybe
pollinator plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you would grow in
your greenhouse if you had cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: you think would be potentially beneficial
in one of those aspects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends on what I was growing in
my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I a cannabis grower, or am I an
nasturtium farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're a cannabis grower,
for the sake of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think the aphid banker plant
system that's commercially available as of
[SPEAKER_01]: yet, we haven't proved really a need for
that, even though I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's worth the potential
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be potential with using the
purple flash pepper with aureus,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've seen in outdoor cannabis
production, aureus feeding on spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know aureus will go to cannabis and
feed on the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with aureus, which is also
called the minute fire bug, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a pollen for it to complete its life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most greenhouses, you don't have a
pollen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what this pepper program
does, is you grow the peppers and it
[SPEAKER_01]: provides pollen so that the adults can
have pollen, lay their eggs on those
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper plants, reproduce, and then they'll
leave, and then they'll go out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and look for things like thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll also find things like spider mites
and other pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them even feed on foliar aphids,
and they can help really suppress pest
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, I am way oversimplifying
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not, oh, I'm going to grow some
peppers and just throw them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a strict regimen on how you do
this, the timing and all kinds of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we don't have time to cover today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if any of the potential
plants, banker systems, I think that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that might have the most potential for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to get trials set up and see
if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anything with cover crops,
with people running cover crops underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a potential detriment in
terms of being a plant host for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about inside or outside
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen it in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly outdoor production with cover
crops, but I have seen guys running in
[SPEAKER_00]: large containers or beds using cover crops
as a living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, outside, I would be, you know,
they're doing it in Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Ag is doing it today in lots of
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in landscapes and stuff,
and it's basically providing food
[SPEAKER_01]: resources for other beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside, you better know what you're doing,
because again, it could become a harbor
[SPEAKER_01]: for your pests as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you just can't say,
oh, I'm just going to throw this plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: here, because, you know, it could be an
alternate host for disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, an alternate host for your pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very leery about doing
something like that indoors, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you, you know, are really on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would the same be said for most mulches or
even mulching with the plant leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan leaves that are dead directly off
the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not want to do that, because if
there's spider mite eggs on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: other pests, and if they can find their
way off there and go right back up onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, that's sanitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always want to get rid of any diseased
plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not throw it in a garbage can and let
it sit in your greenhouse for a day or
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be out of that facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that everything that you're
saying is very general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of the, if we were to talk
about specific pests or specific
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, they require a lot
more knowledge than you have time or
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to share today on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we talk just briefly in just very
general terms about the few major pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little about spider mites
already, but would you be able to cover a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats used to be a big problem in
greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that we have a steady supply of
really good quality beneficial nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not so much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're growing in some of these,
what I'll call artificial media,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things like rockwool, nematodes really
aren't crazy about being in that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, from my experience,
it's easier to manage pests when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in cocoa or what we'd call a
potting mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for ease of growing, a lot of
people are moving to these artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: medias, but it's harder to manage the
pests there with the biocontrol agents
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't really like being in
that artificial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now granted, from a chemical standpoint,
for the states that, and you got to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at your state and see what you can do and
da-da-da-da, but BT, bacillus
[SPEAKER_01]: thuringiensis israeliensis, and that's the
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I see a lot of people making
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple strains of BTs,
and you've got to have the strain for
[SPEAKER_01]: flies, which is israeliensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can still work for fly larva
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be ingested by the flies,
but we do have resistant populations out
[SPEAKER_01]: there because it's been used so much that
it may not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that does have to be
ingested, and typically, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: really wait about a week before you're
going to see results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a result on your sticky cards
because you change your sticky cards every
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday, and you date them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't leave them out for two,
three, and four weeks, so when I show up,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have no idea what's going on,
and you're buying good quality sticky
[SPEAKER_01]: cards from companies like BioBest has nice
sticky cards, Colbert has nice sticky
[SPEAKER_01]: cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really good quality products
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the cannabis growers use a lot
of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they're folded,
and you peel them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the sticky cards that have paper on
each side because you can peel it off one
[SPEAKER_01]: week, and then the next week, you can peel
off the other side and move that paper
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the other side, so you can get two
weeks out of one sticky card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Positioning is important depending on what
pest you're trying to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticky cards, that's like a whole
discussion in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fungus gnats, that's really critical
to know what your population is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can get large sticky ribbons
that come on rolls now, and they'll string
[SPEAKER_01]: them up through the greenhouses for what's
called mass trapping, and that's to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that fungus gnat larvae do feed
on the roots of plants and can vector
[SPEAKER_01]: plant diseases, so that's why managing
them and really getting their numbers down
[SPEAKER_01]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have a friend who took his sticky
cards and put them, rather than being
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical, he put them horizontal right
beneath the canopy, and that's how he runs
[SPEAKER_00]: them in his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anyone else doing that as a
way of catching things going up and down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just catching by luck as they
come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way insects are trapped on sticky
cards is by the light reflecting off of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, and so there's lots of discussion on
outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which way you position them and
everything, but you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like the horizontal positioning
near the soil surface that will attract
[SPEAKER_01]: them up, but again, lighting is a big part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would they get more light because the
top side would be completely exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a flat surface, and then the
bottom side would be completely shaded,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, by catching things that are
flying up, and then the other thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the light on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I'm describing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, yeah, I know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen interior scapes, they cut them
into narrow strips to kind of hide them in
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, this is where you could do a
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some down, some up, and see what works
best for you in your growing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way your lighting is positioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, see what you catch,
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a really easy thing to
compare and check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a little bit on fungus now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about root
aphids, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick, brief, one-minute thing on
root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the root aphid that the cannabis
industry is dealing with, from what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen, it's also found in the ornamental
industry, too, and has a pretty wide host
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, again, if you are on a
system where you overhead irrigate and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can flow out the bottoms of the whole
holes in the pots, or if you're an ebb and
[SPEAKER_01]: flood system, you just keep spreading them
around through your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lettuce grower that had a
different species, but it's still a root
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid, in an NFT system, and they shut it
down, scrubbed everything, put it back
[SPEAKER_01]: together, started from seed again,
and they were back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all it takes is missing one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's very dangerous about
bringing in plants with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's easy to look on leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to find pests in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how these root aphids are
spreading around, is through rooted plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any quick recommendations
for people that they could look into,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are dealing with root aphids?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are not in a state that
prohibits botanogard or mycotrol wettable
[SPEAKER_01]: powder, that works extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there's science on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioworks has a sheet how to deal with root
aphids using botanogard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, again, certain states
have disallowed it, which it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrating because we do have a good
option out there for managing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been, I know some people are
recommending using some of the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the hypoaspis miles,
which is now Australia lapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have not seen it really suppress
enough or control root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there is a difference between,
oh, if I put it in a petri dish,
[SPEAKER_01]: can it snack on a newly birthed baby aphid
and being able to control a pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are taking what they've seen in
a petri dish on a small scale and
[SPEAKER_01]: extrapolating it to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think the rove beetles do predate
some on them, but I've just not seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the level where I would feel
comfortable still with it at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, we are setting up some
trial work looking at nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you're in a rockwool system,
it's much more difficult for those
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes to be able to hold on because
nematodes are actually semi-aquatic and
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to be able to move on a water
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they move extremely well in,
you know, traditional media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that situation, if they could come
in contact with the aphid, possibly it
[SPEAKER_01]: could kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know yet if nematodes truly
can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we're setting up a
trial right now on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be remiss then if I didn't at
least bring up broad mites and russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites briefly with you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I can avoid a bunch of angry
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to touch on those two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad mites in, and I hate to keep going
back to ornamentals, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're seeing in ornamentals can
affect vegetable production and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the worst year of broad mites
I've ever seen in my life in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: and ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one particular variety of
plant that cuttings were coming in from
[SPEAKER_01]: offshore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same way cannabis is getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring your cuttings in or even your
rooted cuttings and the pest is at such a
[SPEAKER_01]: low level, it's not detectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you know, you pot them up or you
stick your cuttings under a mist system
[SPEAKER_01]: and the level stays at a dull roar,
a dull roar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you turn around
and you've got a lot of deformed growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think they have spread, the broad
mites spread from that one initial plant
[SPEAKER_01]: onto lots of other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you bought, you know,
planted hanging baskets and brought them
[SPEAKER_01]: into your cannabis operation, there's a
chance you could spread the broad mite
[SPEAKER_01]: that way because broad mite has many,
many, many hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like where the cannabis
russet mite has one host.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, it's much more what we call
cosmopolitan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around in lots of different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my experience this year, we know we
can manage broad mite with a preventative
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing people are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't contact me when your plants are
webbed over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't contact me when you have 10,000,
you know, hemp russet mites on a leaf and
[SPEAKER_01]: expect me to be able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all about prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second you bring a cutting in,
the second you stick it, the second you
[SPEAKER_01]: pot it, I would be putting predatory mites
out on these plants and assuming you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a preventative program,
it's a lot cheaper than trying to fix a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with the hemp
russet mite, which is moving around
[SPEAKER_01]: through the industry, as we discussed
before, so easily and it is just spreading
[SPEAKER_01]: and spreading and just assume you're going
to end up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so starting a preventative program
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into many ornamental operations
today, when they stick their cutting,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start on predatory mites right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their main nemesis is western flower
thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come every year and it's worth the
investment to treat in propagation over
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cure it in a finished product
because when you have plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: small and compact together, it's really
easy and inexpensive to use the predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've got bigger, larger plants,
it's much harder to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis industry is being too
reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be more pro-reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as which species, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you an outdoor grow in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going in a greenhouse in,
you know, Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing in a warehouse in Florida?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to look at your
different growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What your pest complex is to be able to
get the right predatory mite for what you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got to look at is a sachet
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a hanging sachet right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a sachet on a stick right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want loose product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you know, loose product,
you have problems sprinkling on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may need other release systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to make it too
complicated, but this is why you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with somebody that knows what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there's not many people
that do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the challenge today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of people that will say they
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could clone myself and,
you know, every state could have a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne's to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just, I can't do that technology
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to get with somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me a thing saying,
you know, that someone was recommending
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucumeris or spider mite control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That no, no, no, I mean, just no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen that somebody is making that
recommendations that selling biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: agents to growing operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not that's that no,
no, just it's bad recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of summarize what we
talked about today, these biocontrols
[SPEAKER_00]: really do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're effective, but they require a lot
of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every growing environment and every every
pest requires very specific controls and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a takeaway, I guess for growers,
what I want to say is I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage people from using biocontrols.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've established that it's fairly
complicated, but there are resources out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the insectaries and I'll put
up a list of those insectaries on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you'd like to share
for people, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general regarding biocontrols?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think with the way regulation is
going and pesticide testing is going,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the cannabis industry is
going to be forced more heavily into more
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Delaware that there's no
pesticides allowed at all on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little nervous about California
opening up next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think we're going to have
shortages of biocontrol agents because
[SPEAKER_01]: even now there are some issues with being
able to get product because the demand for
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of biocontrol agents and
greenhouse vegetables and ornamentals is
[SPEAKER_01]: just skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's due to, again, they're not
really able to manage the pests with even
[SPEAKER_01]: the pesticide products they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, fine, give the cannabis
industry all these chemicals that the
[SPEAKER_01]: other guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just develop resistance to them
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to be right back
where you started from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're going to have to be looking
at biocontrol and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: biorational products to be able to manage
your pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that why do biocontrols not
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be, again, wrong product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you don't know truly what
your pest is and you're releasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong biocontrol agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticide residue, you've sprayed
something on your plant that can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because it's an OMRI listed
product, it does not mean that it is safe
[SPEAKER_01]: with biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to, you know, understand chemical
interactions and then product quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's getting product to you in
a timely manner that's viable and ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, you know, a very
important part of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen some of the, I like to call
them nozzle head, some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: ornament nozzle head people out there that
would never use biocontrol, are now using
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol because they realize they have
to have this as part of their pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying pesticides are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying you're not going to have to
spray if you use bios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bios are not right for every single
growing situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the things we know they can do,
you know, I think that there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a really, really good tool to have as
long as you use them right and understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can't, you know, big bold
font underlined flashing letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to work with somebody that
knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with somebody coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, they want to work with you,
you know, ask them what their
[SPEAKER_01]: qualifications are.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have they been doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what makes them qualified?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, I've seen a lot of people,
a lot of growers, unfortunately get bad
[SPEAKER_01]: information from people who, you know,
intentions good or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are not providing them good quality
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to see people from
outside of just the cannabis industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: are making these recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have experience in,
like you mentioned, working with larger
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental greenhouses and in egg and
things like that on the, on the entomology
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I tell cannabis people all
the time is, so poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse growers don't make money off of
selling poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a way to keep all their
employees working through, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter months and keep everything
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a ornamental person uses a product on a
poinsettia, you know, it has to work and
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good product because a poinsettia
grower is not going to spend two cents
[SPEAKER_01]: more for a plant if it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they can't afford to use products
that do not work because there is almost
[SPEAKER_01]: no minimal profit margin on things like
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at what poinsettia
growers use, they use, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: botanogard, they use root shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even had some of them using some of
the horticultural oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now granted, some people are still using
traditional chemistries with a solid
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation program, but many of the
ornamental growers are being forced out of
[SPEAKER_01]: using the neonic insecticides,
which that pressures coming from the big
[SPEAKER_01]: box retailers that are not allowing
growers to use the neonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are losing that whole group of
chemistries to be able to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: which poinsettia growers have relied on so
heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking at these other
replacements, and they're actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: into using a fair amount of biocontrol
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying they're never spraying,
but, you know, these biocontrol options
[SPEAKER_01]: are working for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they don't have much wiggle
room on a plant as far as pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I really think biocontrols
are the future of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the reasons you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticide resistant issues,
the worker safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think public pressure is going to come
in as people learn more and more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that are being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really do work, especially when
we're talking about the monocropping
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on, obviously, in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that these large scale
horticultural growers are using
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrols, like you mentioned,
really speaks volumes because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the profit margins that a lot of
people do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be really smart with their
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you mentioned, I really do think
this is the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that there will be more
consultants available down the road as
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry blossoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think more people will get more
experience under their belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to be really lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I got in like I don't want to say
ground level, I got in it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sub basement level to this, you know,
when biocontrol was really uncool,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I felt this was the way the
industry is going to go because of you
[SPEAKER_01]: just look at, you know, the pesticide
treadmill that, you know, people get on
[SPEAKER_01]: and resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see more companies coming
to the United States, bringing products
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at a company like Beneficial
Insectary, they're based in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've really expanded their production.
[SPEAKER_01]: BioLine in California also, they produce
persimilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, as far as I'm concerned,
the best producer of persimilis hands
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can order the persimilis right
from them at the insectary there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're on the West
Coast, I mean, they bottle it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and you get it by next morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how can you, you know,
beat that on that kind of product?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're working on becoming more
efficient at production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have more product available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's more things happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just unless you're dialed into
the biocontrol industry, it's hard to know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's going on in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we're a very,
very small group.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not a lot of us in the
biocontrol industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, thank you again for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're busy and I don't want to
take up too much more of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you hopefully
at another trade show or talk in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give myself one shameless
plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, in March, I am working
on organizing right now a, we're not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's going to be a half day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to pull for a full day,
biocontrol, cannabis, workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, they haven't, we haven't figured
out a date yet, but it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: early part of March and it's going to be
in San Diego, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still trying to get that all
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's something that if
you spend a day with me, I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain hurt by the time you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's going to be a lot of
information because you know, I fire you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been to one of my talks,
I fire information pretty fast at you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, if we're given this longer
time period, we can go more in depth on
[SPEAKER_01]: these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that would be invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact that are there any other publicly
available talks that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: giving in the near future that you could,
you could mention?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm someone's organizing one for Florida,
but you know, the Florida market for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is so, so small that that's not,
you know, not going to have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, necessary draw for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do, you know, I will say that I'm
having more cannabis people show up at my
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental workshops and other,
other classes because you can take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, biology information and
sanitation information and it does
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try really hard to keep up with the
calendar on my website on bug lady
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, where's the bug lady and
you can go up there and see, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to be speaking up in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came over next month or the end of this
month, actually, I think on pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: compatibility and bio control information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also working on putting together
for cultivate, which is the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse trade show, um, in the U S
that's going to be in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Saturday of that show, I'm putting
together an entire day, a workshop
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on bio control and focusing,
uh, a lot on insect identification and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I do teach stuff all over,
you know, they said I've, I've spoken to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna con, um, I've done some workshops
out in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in, I am just all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely put links to all of that
on the podcast page so people can find the
[SPEAKER_00]: link to your events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that one in San Diego sounds
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I will try and make it down for
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just guiding right now about how
much we're going to do because we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do any kind of hands on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably going to have to limit the
number of attendees because when it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: so big, it's really hard to do any kind of
hands on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as it, as it progresses,
um, you know, we'll have more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had our first call about it the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I look forward to staying in touch
and seeing what exciting stuff you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, thank you again for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
also known as the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her website is www.bugladyconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted the links and information we
discussed in this podcast right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the podcast menu on the top
of the screen and don't forget to sign up
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website homepage so you can stay
updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a few really exciting
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll want to be on that email list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be announcing soon that could
dramatically reduce your labor costs and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to let everyone know that I will
be pausing the podcast schedule for the
[SPEAKER_00]: month of December, as it's just too busy
with the holidays, but we will be back up
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2018 with more amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also tossing around the idea of doing
a listener content email episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I would answer any questions you
might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding cultivation and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email at Tad at KIS organics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's T-A-D at KIS organics.com or
anything through our website contact page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great opportunity to fill in the
gaps between all of the speakers and
[SPEAKER_00]: information that's been shared already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday
season and stay tuned for more cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and science podcasts in the
new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
