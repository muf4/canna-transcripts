[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had Bryant on the podcast a few times
in the past and he's one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant is a certified crop advisor who
specializes in organic cannabis nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has spent the last five years working
to combine precision laboratory techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: with data science in an effort to unravel
the complexities of cannabis soil and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with his work on soilless media,
he also helps outdoor cultivators around
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States with nutrient management
and cover cropping.

going back to review some of the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's excellent and I highly recommend it
for anyone wanting to do a deep dive on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis fertility and reusing your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bryant, welcome to the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of our most popular guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always learn so much when I talk to you,
so I'm really grateful for this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been on before and I hope
listeners go back and check out our
[SPEAKER_00]: previous podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, can you just give a quick
background about yourself here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll dive right in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Bryant Mason and I am a
certified crop advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with many different growers across
various crop types, primarily cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also tree fruit, diversified
vegetables, any high value crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had my own business for five or
six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, I was doing a lot of
consulting under other people's businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have my own farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an 11 acre farm in western Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dozens of different crops,
vegetables and diversified fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my primary cash crop is peaches and I
do a lot of experimentation in my orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I specialize in nutrient management and
more specifically, I just do organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am constantly working with growers
and exploring and learning about
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure we'll talk about some of that
today and we can just go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I know that one of the first
things that you want to talk about were
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these specific minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just let's just dive right in
with that and kind of just share what's
[SPEAKER_00]: been on your brain lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say in 2023, there were three
nutrients that I kept thinking about and
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back to in various situations I was
working with growers and actually in my
[SPEAKER_01]: own peach orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think calcium has always been a very
interesting nutrient for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been drawn to calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my general beliefs is that it's
been, calcium has been fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: deprioritized in agriculture for the value
that it brings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That provides to plant health and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always thinking about calcium
and there's one thing, there's essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: three things that I think the cannabis
community has generally accepted around
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the use of lime and gypsum in
relatively high quantities to push calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: up in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The use of calcium foliars and we can talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final thing is just proper
irrigation and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watering technique to really make sure
that the transpiration stream is moving
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium into the parts of the plant that
it's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a conversation with I've had
multiple conversations with apple growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think there's one thing that's
missing in the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation around calcium that I wanted
to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to take a step back, the reason
apple growers know more about calcium than
[SPEAKER_01]: any other group of growers, in my opinion,
is because apple growers suffer from a
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder called bitter pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you know this,
but in your home state, specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern Washington, 90% of the organic
apples are grown in Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those apples are honey crisp
because people love honey crisp.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little too sweet for my liking,
but it's a good crunchy apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is very susceptible to bitter pit
which is actually a calcium disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these growers make a lot of money on
selling honey crisp apples, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: they can only sell half of the apples that
they harvest because in storage they get
[SPEAKER_01]: this bitter pit, this calcium disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have figured out how to go from
let's say 50% pack out to 95% pack out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've spoken to these growers at length
about how they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number one, a pretty basic,
yearly application of one ton per acre of
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum banded in the rows of the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think cannabis growers are
already applying gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend it in I would say moderate
doses in the majority of my
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you use gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone seems to use gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsum can be applied at way higher
quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for this is because the
solubility of gypsum is relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything, it has a low salt index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all fertilizers have a salt index and
gypsum is relatively low because the
[SPEAKER_01]: solubility is relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you apply excess gypsum,
let's say four tons per acre, or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: case of a peat-based media, like 25 pounds
per yard, or even growers do more
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes, it just sits as calcium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't dissolve any further into the
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't create too much salt stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, gypsum will increase the EC of
the soil, but not excessively where it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: burn the plant or create excessive osmotic
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so gypsum is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing that they do is they are
constantly thinking about soil moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: and weighing consistent soil moisture
versus drybacks because like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production, there are reasons to dry back
fruit trees at critical times to do
[SPEAKER_01]: different things for fruit development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're constantly aware that when
they dry back their soil, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce calcium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would never dry back their soil at
a critical point when they want calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake during cell division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I think we sort of understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third thing is foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it gets a little more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the guys I've talked to who
have essentially eliminated bitter mint in
[SPEAKER_01]: apples, they don't think a few foliars do
anything, but they are dead set on foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying to get that extra 10% of calcium
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do foliars every 48 hours during
cell division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't think just doing a couple
foliars is going to influence calcium very
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead, they double or triple down
on calcium foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the cell division period of
apple development, they're often applying
[SPEAKER_01]: a foliar every 48 hours, which is pretty
intense from a management standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I immediately think of issues with
labor, humidity, product costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a ton of things that pop
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's group labor and product costs
into the same category because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: both dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you grow a high value crop,
the difference between 50% packout and
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% packout and Honeycrisp apples is like
on a thousand acres is millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy Steve and I spoke to, he still
thinks that, let's just say 90% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium is taken up by the soil,
but just that extra 10% in foliar is
[SPEAKER_01]: giving him that decrease in bitter pit
enough to pay for all the labor,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is hundreds if not hundreds
of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can justify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are certain instances in
any high value crop where you can justify
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it's excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting to me is I've always
had this sort of internal bias that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: all about the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have, but I'm sort of a constant
skeptic about how much is making it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was sort of validating to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth thing, and this is what I think
is most interesting and most missed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis conversation is the number of new
shoots and the rate of shoot growth is
[SPEAKER_01]: massively important for the use of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any growing shoot requires a tremendous
amount of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in apple production, they are
preventing terminal growth and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually summer pruning usually in like
May to prevent too many growing shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you have too many growing
shoots, it's an enormous calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that in my orchard, there was a
pest that essentially ate the top of every
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed just a couple of days too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happened is it essentially
topped my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine topping a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it did that to every shoot on my
tree, which then turned into four new
[SPEAKER_01]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I quadrupled the number of new growing
shoots on my trees and that I'm fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: confident created a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very long winded way to
summarize what I've been thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think cannabis growers need to think
about the number of shoots that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actively growing and the rate at which
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a piece of calcium I have
never been able to figure out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is oftentimes I'll see sufficient
calcium on a pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say 150 to 200 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see 80% base saturation, which I
don't put much weight on, but I know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by those two metrics, calcium is
sufficient in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers doing calcium foliars and
their VPD is good and their soil moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: is relatively good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're even using blue mats and
measuring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I get tissue test results back
and the calcium is still at let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: three and a half or 4%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I'll add is there's
not an excess of magnesium or potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: that antagonize calcium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other thing in that grand
picture of calcium is the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing shoots and the rate of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna stop there and throw
that out there for listeners to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: chew on over the next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the next several months or the next
growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many thoughts and questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean that would be one reason
it'd be more advantageous to grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to create a canopy versus a single
plant just for the ability of the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: move calcium effectively to all the shoots
that are creating the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting back to the calcium example,
when I think of calcium one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about is evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because calcium moves through the xylem
and I always confuse the two but I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: got it right this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it moves through the xylem,
it's very linked to transpiration reach
[SPEAKER_00]: which then moves me over to thinking about
environment and VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about calcium movement in
the plant or out to the leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where my brain goes first is
moisture levels in the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how you would manipulate
that in an apple orchard but I wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: about like is that I mean should that be
the first way we approach calcium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I listen this podcast I'm
wondering if people are gonna think oh
[SPEAKER_00]: this I just need to be spraying calcium
like crazy onto my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds to me like like the way
you're describing it that is the last 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's all these other things that
need to be in place first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I want to reiterate that I think that
foliars are at best 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any hard evidence for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just my intuition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no I think foliars are the last thing
to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you're saying is more
accurate because another anecdote is the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato growers who experience blossom end
rot, another calcium disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often inconsistent soil moisture
where the dry backs are too big and
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium uptake stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you but I think once you
cover soil moisture and VPD there's very
[SPEAKER_01]: few other toggles that we have to increase
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean airflow I suppose like but I think
that's similar too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah airflow over the leaf surface I think
would be a good thing to look at there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So airflow over the leaf surface,
VPD and soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else we can manipulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it but I wonder if you're
spraying calcium every 48 hours are you
[SPEAKER_00]: creating pathogen pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well so in indoor cannabis production
that's not something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an anecdote from the apple
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah I mean for the apple industry
though I would think you'd just be opening
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up to a variety of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well so the beauty of Eastern Washington
as you know those Cascade Mountains are
[SPEAKER_01]: wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably raining outside right now
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern Washington's different though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you foliar, one of the primary
reasons all the apples are produced over
[SPEAKER_01]: there is the dry climate reduces disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way easier to be an organic grower in
Eastern Washington than it is to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: apples in Michigan or New York or really
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the reason I like Western
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air is just bone dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's probably lower spore pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way lower yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The VPD is not balanced necessarily in
these dry I mean in these outdoor dry
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity is just too low for optimal
VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that means is very low disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a trade-off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so you talk about all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start there actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said when the plants at levels
where it's doing its highest cell division
[SPEAKER_00]: we can target drybacks and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we really know in cannabis when those
moments are that we should be triggering
[SPEAKER_00]: drybacks or considering them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cell division is for the apple
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cell division of the fruit which is
you know a 30 day period after
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've identified what they would call
a critical point in the fruit life cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: where they do the foliars every 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for two to four weeks after
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think that there's a critical
growth period that's been identified in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis production when calcium is needed
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact it seems to me like it's
needed throughout the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again there's just a difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I generally believe that it's
especially needed in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's critically important to
maximize calcium uptake in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In organic production I've never seen it
overdone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the reason that it's so
important in veg is not because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: critical point of influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because you can't get it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're at week four of flower you're
not gonna catch up if your calcium uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've sort of seen through years
of working with cannabis growers is the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest yielding plants have to have
enough calcium going in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also believe that the lowest disease
pressure and just the best vigor and
[SPEAKER_01]: general plant health comes from sufficient
calcium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I like focusing on veg is
because you don't want to play catch up
[SPEAKER_01]: with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned its movement is in the
transpiration stream, the water going up
[SPEAKER_01]: through the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you just want to maintain that
stream of calcium throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this from sort of a I
guess a more like applied real world usage
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've talked about gypsum and I'm
gonna say things here that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers already know but I just want to
make sure we're not missing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsum, calcium, sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really gonna impact the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't overdo sulfur from what
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really great form of calcium and
there's a lot of different ways to get
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to watch heavy metals because
they will vary across gypsum sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smaller the particulate,
the more soluble it is, the more available
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be the plant because it has a
larger surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for all amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else really quickly you want
about calcium before we talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about some of these other limes and other
options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well yeah I was gonna say we'll last
tonight but we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other thing I'd say just in that
in the particle size conversation is I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's a really good technique to
diversify the particle size of the gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah let's just say you're doing a
pre-plant amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'd recommend a powdered gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often a solution grade gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partially because you can also feed that
or top dress it in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just nice to have one gypsum
product on hand and use it as a pre-plant
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment and also in the middle of the
round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a technique to use a granular
gypsum which might you know just release a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically it's not a slow releasing
fertilizer and in theory if you drop the
[SPEAKER_01]: granular gypsum in water it should
dissolve into its constituent particles
[SPEAKER_01]: that are just the same size as the
solution grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in practice it does take a little bit
more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it acts sort of as a slow release
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're running a lot of
water through your soil like if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: watering to run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say most living soil growers aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's the case you are going to be
flushing some of that solution grade
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum out of your system constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having granular gypsum might help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other thing I'd mention is
sulfur from gypsum I don't think can be
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sulfur from let's say a more soluble
product like potassium sulfate I do think
[SPEAKER_01]: can be excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I dissolve potassium sulfate in
water and do a pace test on it I'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: like 420 parts per million of sulfur which
I think is too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from gypsum specifically I don't think
excess sulfur is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about runoff I do
think a lot of even living soil growers
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're in containers at the smaller
stages of growth it's impossible not to
[SPEAKER_00]: have runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are leaching at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I think maybe in veg
having some granular gypsum in there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a useful way to just make sure that's
breaking down a little bit slower than the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an interesting point that
you brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just less mobile in those little
pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to sulfur though so I've always
thought of sulfur I mean critical for for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene development a lot of different
plant processes but not really something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen it like a sulfur toxicity
in cannabis per se but really the risk is
[SPEAKER_00]: just osmotic shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The osmotic pressure in the soil due to
salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things that we're talking
about are quote unquote salts and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that are in the soil the higher
the salt level of the soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there other things like you mentioned
the issue of it with like potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about the sulfur and potassium
sulfate versus gypsum that you see you
[SPEAKER_00]: know causing more issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only difference is if you drop
potassium sulfate in the soil solution if
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply it to the soil and you water it
it'll dissolve up to over 400 grams per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of water compared to gypsum which
is only like eight or nine grams per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the solubility of that potassium
sulfate molecule is just so much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than the calcium sulfate molecule that it
will release more ions into the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sulfur is the same I mean it's the
same thing but you just get such a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of it that the EC the
soluble salts the osmotic stress those are
[SPEAKER_01]: all somewhat synonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just way way higher with a
fertilizer that's more soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but in general if we're just focusing
on gypsum no I don't think I mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil solution will go to maybe a
hundred or a hundred twenty ppm of soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur and that's almost never an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see the sulfur on a tissue test
be toward the high end of the sufficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: range or even out of the sufficiency range
but I don't think there's any issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no antagonisms with other anions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I guess we're getting into more
of the realm of anecdotes here but some
[SPEAKER_01]: growers well there's two there's two
things that I've heard from growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is a myth in my opinion and
that's that sulfur levels like that are
[SPEAKER_01]: kill soil biology and I just don't think
there's any evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean soil microbes need sulfur and there
are certain populations or certain species
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually prefer high sulfur
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may you'll see a shift in the
population profile like you will with any
[SPEAKER_01]: management action that you take but it
definitely doesn't kill microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that comes from the idea that
there are a lot of fungicides in organic
[SPEAKER_01]: production that contains sulfur so
something called the Bordeaux mixture or
[SPEAKER_01]: lime sulfur like it's a it's a great
fungicide when topically applied to the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves but it's in a totally different
it's completely different chemistry in
[SPEAKER_01]: those products versus sulfur in the soil
and at a hundred ppm it's not toxic it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not caustic it's not I don't understand
the functional mechanism in which it would
[SPEAKER_01]: kill microbes and I you still see
microbial action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a microscope I don't use a
microscope but use the microbes are
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly thriving based on a number of
other metrics when you use a lot of gypsum
[SPEAKER_01]: so I do not believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is smoke quality you know
people have told me that you know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this ash color debate I think Brandon when
you had Brandon on I think he addressed
[SPEAKER_01]: this very well but I and I did go down
this rabbit hole for a while like is
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur affecting ash color and my
conclusion is is I'm not a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: confident with the ash color debate but
I'm pretty confident that it doesn't so I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't call that a myth because I'm not
I still think I'm still unclear on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral the contribution of minerals to
ash color but I can very confidently say
[SPEAKER_01]: that the primary determinant of ash color
is in is incomplete combustion of or of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon based molecules of organic
compounds and this is what Brandon
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed really well so that's that's the
number one thing and I think it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very likely that that's the only thing but
growers have come to me a lot let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: look at my sulfur this is gonna affect my
my ash color and I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing to add to that yeah so okay
I feel like we covered gypsum obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other forms of calcium that we can
we can get into the plant or into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or foliar do you want to talk a little bit
about lime dolomite and then molastinite I
[SPEAKER_01]: think are the big let me just pitch I
don't want to talk about lime or dolomite
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to pitch molastinite as for two
reasons one is it's the least expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: source of silica and I think most cannabis
growers understand that silica can be
[SPEAKER_01]: highly beneficial for a number of reasons
and there aren't a lot of organic options
[SPEAKER_01]: and the options tend to be expensive
except molastinite molastinite is very
[SPEAKER_01]: inexpensive and it's a great way if your
pH is just a little bit low to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH and provide a bunch of really
inexpensive silica to your soil plant
[SPEAKER_01]: available it also has a slower I think
what's called a dissolution rate than lime
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's if you have downward pressure
on your soil pH from your water or from
[SPEAKER_01]: peat mineralizing or from organic acids or
whatever once that acidity eats through
[SPEAKER_01]: lime if lime is the only pH buffering
molecule in the soil it you can get a very
[SPEAKER_01]: sharp decline a very a very sharp and fast
rapid rate of pH drop in your soil things
[SPEAKER_01]: like oyster shell and molastinite have a
bit more buffering capacity it's a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: slower so you're not going to see as as
aggressive of a pH drop so I mean if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're checking your pH if your soil
testing it doesn't really matter you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep adding lime but I feel I like
molastinite because it in theory is that
[SPEAKER_01]: that drop isn't gonna happen as fast once
the acidity neutralizes all those alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that answers a puzzle for me
because I've seen soil tests where they
[SPEAKER_00]: test you know beginning cycle mid cycle
and the pH you know being logarithmic I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have expected it to drop as
quickly as it did given I can drop like a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock yeah what they've told me and that's
always puzzled me on it I've seen it a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times now so you're saying that's all due
to them the the microbes or the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the alkalinity of the lime and
then there's just yeah so once it chews
[SPEAKER_01]: through all that lime it's it's sort of
like if you dump vinegar on lime you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if fizz isn't bubbles and does the little
volcano thing well eventually you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you keep pouring vinegar on it it eats
through all that lime when it stops and
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles like the lime doesn't it it
neutralizes all of it and it there's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing left to buffer the soil now
compost helps and other things help
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're also have buffering
capacity so in a you know I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to see that pH drop in your soil
for example because there's just a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic compounds in there but eventually
it could happen it'd be more I would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect it more in like a like closer to
just a non compost based media like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa peat perlite mix with dolomites or
whatever yeah like a pro mix for sure in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pro mix I think you can see a sharp drop
so there is more I do I do agree there's
[SPEAKER_01]: more buffering capacity in living soils
but I disagree that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about pH in living soil I think I
think let's talk about it let's dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: that because I love this topic I I think
that's so critical so yeah and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about this and I want to hear
your spiel because my big thing is yes
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil has buffering capacity
microbes are amazing people and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what people rely on but if we can get pH
into an optimal range so the plant isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: putting you know wasting photosynthetic
energy that's creating on just getting
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the nutrients it wants out of the
soil like why wouldn't we adjust the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: like I never understood that argument for
people who say pH doesn't matter in a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil okay I dare you to run your
soil at 5.0 in a living soil and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens I mean it's just not it's not good
plant health plant health declines quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: at really low pH's I've seen it so many
times now here's the argument you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: really though Bryant and this is and I
know you'll be able to see speak to this
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I've never pHed my soil my but
my water is eight five or my water is
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or I use rainwater well yeah yeah my
second point to what I was gonna say to
[SPEAKER_01]: the will run your soul at 5.0 well that's
kind of hard to create a 5.0 pH soil in a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil because there's we put so much
into these soils and most of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: we put in specifically compost but also
all the organic amendments soft rock
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate crustacean meal lime last night
all of those things are putting upward
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure on the peach so usually after you
mix a soil blend it's gonna land you know
[SPEAKER_01]: in a higher pH range not always but often
so then a grower runs their soil they have
[SPEAKER_01]: great success and they say I've never pHed
my soil well it started with a good pH
[SPEAKER_01]: started with a high pH and you you
continue adding amendments and compost
[SPEAKER_01]: that put upward pressure on the pH and or
water in your example so maybe you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: high pH water that's putting constant
upward pressure on your on your media pH
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you yeah you don't have to worry
about it but that's not because that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the mistake people make is is
creating a universal statement like you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to worry about pH because it's
a living soil that is inaccurate
[SPEAKER_01]: technically that's just not it's it's it'd
be more accurate to say a lot of living
[SPEAKER_01]: soils or a lot of peat-based medias you
don't have to worry about pH but to say
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a living soil or all living
soils you don't have to worry about it is
[SPEAKER_01]: not true and I've seen so many soil tests
and I've seen so many issues that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just a hundred percent confident
with that yeah so I the point I was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting as like I more probably more like
I don't have to pH my water because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a living soil and my water isn't eight but
I think you know why that might be okay do
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to just touch on that I mean this
we're getting yes but yes no no this is
[SPEAKER_01]: great it's interesting and sorry I
interrupted you I just was no no please
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you so with it when it comes to
pitching water same thing to say you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to pH water with a living so it's not
sometimes it's accurate sometimes it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: so what's confusing about water is you can
have a water with a pH of let's say seven
[SPEAKER_01]: point five that doesn't need to be pHed
you can have a water with a pH of a
[SPEAKER_01]: different water with a pH of seven point
five that I would argue should be pHed and
[SPEAKER_01]: so what why that's confusing is because I
always stumble on explaining this there
[SPEAKER_01]: are it depends on the the total molecules
in that water that are that matter
[SPEAKER_01]: measured best by a term called alkalinity
which is not pH it's how much acid would
[SPEAKER_01]: it require to lower the pH of that water
and so in water number one it may have an
[SPEAKER_01]: alkalinity of 50 ppm and it just takes a
tiny little drop of citric acid and the
[SPEAKER_01]: peach drops like a rock the same water
with a peach water number two with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same pH of seven five it might take a lot
of acid to drop the pH because the the
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just way more hydroxides or
bicarbonate in water number two so water
[SPEAKER_01]: number one the the soil will buffer that
pH it that the the water is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect the soil pH very quickly because
there's just not a lot of alkaline
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules in that water water number two
requires so much acid to neutralize those
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline molecules that when it hits the
water the the soil solution is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect the water pH it's not going to the
soil is not going to buffer that very well
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's what's confusing is people take
the pH of their water and they think they
[SPEAKER_01]: either need to pH it or they don't need to
pH it but but you actually don't know just
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the pH you have to get a water
test and look at the alkalinity and I
[SPEAKER_01]: usually think when the alkalinity is over
120 ppm that's a good time to consider ph
[SPEAKER_01]: in your water if you're trying to optimize
if you're trying to grow a perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy crop you don't need to but if you
want to optimize I think you should once
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets up to let's say 180 I think it's
critical I think over time if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running your soil over and over again
you're living soil over let's say 10
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds you're gonna see issues yeah you
you said it perfectly and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that we see in forums is where
people are like oh I you know throw away
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH pen I don't need it anymore
because I switched to living soil I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want people to pump the brakes a little
bit and say okay I may not need it quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as much because yes the microbes in the
soil will help buffer the pH all the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic amendments that we're adding the
compost all of this creates a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that's better at buffering but
there are circumstances and you see them I
[SPEAKER_00]: see them because we see soil tests from
all over the country even internationally
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes and things don't you know not
everyone has access to clean water exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah if you I would love to send that
grower a 275 gallon tote of well water
[SPEAKER_01]: from Arizona with a hundred parts per
million of sodium and 350 ppm of
[SPEAKER_01]: alkalinity and a peach of 8.4 it's it's
that's it that's a different situation and
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously that's a extreme example but see
when universals are dangerous yeah I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma in my brain but yeah anywhere
anywhere Aaron when you drill a well in an
[SPEAKER_01]: arid environment you're gonna get
something weird yeah now the reverse can
[SPEAKER_01]: be true with you know in usually in a wet
environment sometimes you can have super
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic water much more rare in my opinion
but you could have acidic water the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution to that's way easier you can just
line your soil or maybe will last night or
[SPEAKER_01]: oyster shell you can push the soil pH a
little higher than you would normally and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that acidic water combines at the
high pH soil and it creates a nice soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution pH so you don't necessarily I
mean or you could peach up your water but
[SPEAKER_01]: that that term peach up usually implies
that you're gonna add a liquid bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium carbonate potassium hydroxide
sometimes not organic and it's just and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're just putting potassium in your
system to increase the pH it's far better
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion because I'm I'm way more
interested in pushing calcium is to just
[SPEAKER_01]: add a alkaline calcium soil amendment and
buffer the pH through the soil and not
[SPEAKER_00]: peach up your water with some liquid
bottle so you talk about well last night
[SPEAKER_00]: and oyster shell together they're
obviously quite different oyster shell
[SPEAKER_00]: being primarily calcium carbonate and in
well last night being calcium silicate one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I want to point out is calcium
silicate doesn't move the pH needle as
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly as no no I will so it's not as
effective per unit of amendment either
[SPEAKER_01]: like lime will increase the pH more every
cup of lime will increase it more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of last night it's sorry I
interrupted again keep going yeah no
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great yeah so it doesn't move the
needles quickly so if you need to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH quickly between cycles then you
want to consider lime or oyster shell
[SPEAKER_00]: though I've always considered oyster shell
and lime in my head the same thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both 99% calcium carbonate or
whatever yeah with the oyster shell maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: having a little more impurities and then
I've just looked at it by in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: particle size so it's interesting to me
that you're differentiating oyster shell
[SPEAKER_01]: from lime no I think I think you're right
I think when you say that I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually think you're right and I agree I
think it's just that oyster shell is more
[SPEAKER_01]: coarse so maybe that's not the right way
to frame it I think that the the rate is
[SPEAKER_01]: still slower for sure but it's probably
due to particle size like you said the
[SPEAKER_01]: coarseness of the the material although
it's an interesting point I'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about that more but I think you're
right and same with aragonite people
[SPEAKER_01]: always mention aragonite to me and I
looked it up and it's just calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate so I do I do agree that those
three properties products should probably
[SPEAKER_01]: just be clustered in the same category
because they're all calcium carbonate when
[SPEAKER_01]: molassanite is is a completely different
molecule so hmm okay yeah one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of calcium that I thought was
interesting is relating to egg shells and
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of crushed egg shells I wasn't
aware of how unavailable that calcium was
[SPEAKER_00]: due to something that the chicken coats it
with that makes it less it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: break down very quickly even when you
crush it more have you read anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: that I haven't read anything about it but
I have some experience with some it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very common JDOM input and in JDOM you
take apple cider vinegar ten parts apple
[SPEAKER_01]: cider vinegar one part egg shells you
crush the egg shells out you leave them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar of apple cider vinegar for months
and months and months and I've seen tests
[SPEAKER_01]: on that I've gotten really into testing
all these different KNF and JDOM inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: and unfortunately it's called WCA the
calcium levels that I've seen were super
[SPEAKER_01]: low but I'm still struggling with this WCA
test to know the dilution of the WCA to
[SPEAKER_01]: water but even at the recommended dilution
rate which is I think a teaspoon per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of water the PPMs were too low in
my opinion way too low so even after
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in apple cider vinegar for months
and months and months very little calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: was liberated from those egg shells or
there just weren't enough egg shells and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan I mean right next to
the WCA recipe in the JDOM book is quick
[SPEAKER_01]: lime or no sorry quick oyster shell WCA
I'm way more interested in that and the
[SPEAKER_01]: results I've seen is that the the parts
per million of calcium are far higher from
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegar and oyster shell flour than it is
from egg shells so no I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: promote or really I'm not really drawn to
using egg shells at all a because it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: totally insoluble and B because it just
doesn't seem like they contribute that
[SPEAKER_01]: much calcium compared to these other
things we're talking about yeah they've
[SPEAKER_00]: done some decomposition studies on it and
they just found it doesn't break down as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as you would think it's not a
period of weeks to months it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of years in a lot of cases in terms
of that calcium being liberated I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and read more but I thought that
was interesting well and especially I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an apple cider vinegar imagine in a
in a in a compost or a soil where the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: is 7 it's not they tested it in soil yeah
oh yeah it'll take decades it'll take yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like yeah it'll take decades I mean
the solubility of oyster shell and soft
[SPEAKER_01]: rock phosphate and a lot of these a lot of
these products that need microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition and weather ring which is
non non microbial sometimes the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: there is wild when it comes to pH pH is a
way bigger driver of decomposition of
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of things than microbial
activity oftentimes so I don't recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: soft rock phosphate when the soil pH is
high because it'll take so long to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually release compared to when the pH
is 5.5 it's a it's a wild difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate I want to point out that oyster
shell flour is typically a mined product
[SPEAKER_00]: to people in their brains think oh I want
to get oyster shell flour because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more sustainable or it's more organic than
lime but really they're both mined
[SPEAKER_00]: products once just being mined from old
marine deposits and the others being mined
[SPEAKER_00]: from you know a lime deposit so I didn't
know that yeah yeah so sometimes I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we think about trying to be more
sustainable or more organic or avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: things for whatever ethical reasons it's a
little more complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: always so anything else on calcium before
we move on to another another topic no I
[SPEAKER_00]: got nothing on my end that was Bryant
