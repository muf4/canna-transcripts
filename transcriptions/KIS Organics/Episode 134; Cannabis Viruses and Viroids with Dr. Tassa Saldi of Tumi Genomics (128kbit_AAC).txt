[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before getting into the podcast,
I wanted to let listeners know of a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, we just released a new bloom
booster that we've been formulating and
[SPEAKER_01]: testing for the past two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now available on our website and it
is the cleanest organic bloom booster on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, I want to let folks know
that we have some new content on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: including recordings of some recent talks
I've given this year at conferences around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, with one highlighting some of
the content from six years of these
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Dr. Tassa Saldi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Saldi is a molecular biologist with
more than 25 years of research experience
[SPEAKER_01]: in RNA biology, infectious disease,
and molecular pathogen detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Saldi graduated summa cum laude with a
degree in molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: She completed her graduate and
postdoctoral studies at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, where she studied RNA structure,
small RNAs, and RNA processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was awarded a prestigious fellowship
from the American Cancer Society and was
[SPEAKER_01]: one of 18 doctoral fellows nationwide
invited to present her research at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspen Cancer Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Saldi has authored more than 20
peer-reviewed articles in top-tier
[SPEAKER_01]: journals.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the chief science officer and
co-founder of TUME Genomics, Dr. Saldi
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to use her expertise to provide
the cannabis industry with reliable,
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate diagnostic tools and pathogen
mitigation guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Tassa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exciting opportunity for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself and TUME as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tassa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief science officer over at TUME
Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as my background is concerned,
I am a molecular biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all of my education, both my
undergrad and graduate, postdoc work at
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of Colorado, either in
Boulder or Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much all of my expertise is around
RNA, which is a molecule that can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: information very similar to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has some other interesting
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently, it's also the molecule that
represents hoplatin-bioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of work on understanding how
RNA is processed, how a structure or the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape that it forms impacts how it's
treated in the cell, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: investigations into RNA processing in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as TUME Genomics, our company was
founded a little bit over four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we were a group of postdocs and
some entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just decided we're done with academia,
we'd like to do something with what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to do that actually will help
people and create products that will
[SPEAKER_00]: change something in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to found TUME Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning of our company was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pivoted a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did cancer genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up making COVID diagnostics for a
while and worked in the COVID diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: lab at CU Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath that, we had some connections
with some growers in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one grower contact us in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was having issues with hoplatin-bioid.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was having a hard time finding tests
and labs that could test for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was reliable, that she would believe
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked us if we could help her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're molecular biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely put something like that
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just grew from there through word of
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we started getting into the cannabis
industry, we realized that this was
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely the place that we wanted to be
because we founded our company with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mission of bringing high quality,
rigorous science to underserved
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we realized how much the industry
needed, more research, more education,
[SPEAKER_00]: more outreach, it was like, this is
exactly why we started a company in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working in cannabis for three
years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great industry to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many opportunities and so much
to learn, which is the fun part of
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a podcast with Dr. Jack Munz of
Three Rivers Biotech talking a bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: HLVD and bioroids and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks can go back and listen to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to cover some of the basics again
in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of hear your experience and take on
things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it important from a grower perspective
to really understand the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between a virus and a viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think certain aspects of understanding
the difference between those two are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the two most important aspects
for people to understand are that viroids
[SPEAKER_00]: lack any type of outside protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most organisms or life has a genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the information that tells that
life how to be whatever it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the outside of it is a fat layer
or protein layer that keeps that
[SPEAKER_00]: information safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you try to kill a pathogen,
a lot of the things that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat it with are targeting that outside
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soap dissolves fat and so that'll make it
fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quaternary ammonia, clean grow,
those kinds of things are targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hoplite and viroid lacks all of
those things, there are a limited number
[SPEAKER_00]: of disinfectants that you can use that are
effective, which is why you have basically
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach or VirCon and there isn't a ton of
other disinfectants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other really important thing to
understand is that viroids lack what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say unique biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a bacterial infection,
you can take an antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the antibiotic is targeting
something specific about bacteria that's
[SPEAKER_00]: different than you or an antifungal or
even an antiviral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because viroids don't have that unique
biology where you can make an anti,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the sequence of the actual
genome, it's much more difficult to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an antiviral or an
antifungal, that's not going to have any
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very unique because of those
two factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other viroids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other viroids in cannabis
that are of major economic importance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in hops, which is very similar
biology genetically to cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: same family, there are other viroids that
can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stunt viroids, crackling bark,
apple fruit crinkle viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those have been characterized as
of yet in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because cannabis is now becoming legal
and its presence is spreading all across,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously all across the United States and
all across the world, the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other viroids kind of
jumping ship over into cannabis continues
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suspect we will find other
viroids in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of yet, we haven't found any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are some best practices in
general in regards to sort of all
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens, you know, viruses, viroids,
bacteria, fungi, all of these things that
[SPEAKER_01]: can damage our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best practices, I think the first and
most important thing that all growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're growing a plant in your
basement or, you know, your huge
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility is to think about
pathogens in a proactive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is infinitely easier to prevent them
from entering your facility than it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate them once they have spread
through your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you prevent that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have kind of a dorky acronym or
whatever at Toomey Genomics called STOP,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of outlines the four big points
of pathogen prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the S stands for sterilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always need to be thinking about
sterilizing your tools, sterilizing your
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure your water is
sterilized if you're getting it from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a well source or something else
where there could be fungus in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surfaces, sterilizing your hands as you
move from plant to plant, just making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you have clean practices, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The T is for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that you test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single most common way anything is
going to get into your facility is on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tissue, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking in clones or seeds,
those things come with unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: hitchhikers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to make sure that they
don't gain access to your precious
[SPEAKER_00]: mother's stock is to test them before you
put them in next to the rest of your moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then preventative testing just to
make sure that nothing is brewing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The O is for organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're
documenting your testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have like a correct and organized
schedule that you're thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow of traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you don't want people to start,
you know, in a high pathogen pressure area
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go to the mom room and start
cutting or whatever, because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to end up pulling those pathogens
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the P is for protecting your
borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's obviously testing before you
bring new stuff in, but also thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about your water system, your brewing
medium, and you can bring pathogens in
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring it in on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, they can even come in on your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that people are, you know,
using gloves and covering their clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to keep all of that stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the control as to what
organisms are allowed to grow on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about best practices,
this question came up recently in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to a new facility starting out that needs
to get genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, clones can can bring in,
you know, hoplite and viroid or other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to start clean and stay
clean, what would be the best practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll throw out a scenario for and then
you can tell me how you how you might
[SPEAKER_01]: approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our thought was initially to grow a
mother plant for two to three months,
[SPEAKER_01]: test that mother plant, test the roots of
that mother plant for hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if that's clean, then we could
pull clones off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when those get a larger test,
those and feel fairly confident that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would what would you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off, how does that sound as
just sort of a good protocol for moving
[SPEAKER_01]: something into your facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're so so if the scenario is that
you already have some plants and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in a set of new genetics,
the first most important step is to define
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarantine area because you need to to
create a space with that has like unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: infection status.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that space has its own set of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody knows that these plants
could be dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're incredibly careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't you don't use those tools
anywhere else in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like work on those plants and
then go to the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants, when you bring them in,
there's a couple important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would definitely test,
like you said right away, the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: for hoplatent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also think about testing for
Fusarium and Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two incredibly damaging root
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, especially Fusarium can
be more damaging than hoplatent,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if it gets out of control,
you can lose like an entire table in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week because it just spreads really
quickly and it's lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also observe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll you'll have them there,
you let them grow a little bit and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like fungus gnats and whatnot fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to to watch them and
make sure that you don't see anything
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait three to four weeks on those
plants and then test them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get two negative tests,
then you can feel pretty confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are not infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, once they go into the
rotation with your regular mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be some type of preventative
testing that you're you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: continually doing on your mother's stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it should go into that rotation
of testing, because even if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in these pathogens, especially
the fungal ones, can get into your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to always be double checking
and making sure that mom stock is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing that hoplatent can come in on
seeds now, what's the best practice there
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of testing and protocols for
making sure that you're getting clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean seed genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on how many seeds you're
buying and kind of how that works into the
[SPEAKER_00]: logistics of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoplatent viroid is in an incredibly high
concentration in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found is if a seed comes
from an infected mother, even if the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that seed doesn't necessarily
have hoplatent, there's a really high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can answer the question,
did the seed come from an infected mother
[SPEAKER_00]: by just testing a few of the seeds from
the batch that you've just purchased?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the best way is to ask the seed
producer to give you some data showing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they tested the mom before they went
and put it into a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still go ahead and test it again
when you get it to your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have 10 seeds or something
like that and you pop those, you can let
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant grow up into the four leaf
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually find it in the
embryonic leaf pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can test them at that point and
ditch the ones that test positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: if any of them do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can actually test seed,
then you're saying, fairly reliably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the one important concept to
remember, so hoplatent viroid is in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high concentration on the outside of the
seed, like the coat, but it's also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: on a high concentration on the inside
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't necessarily mean every
single one of those seeds will give rise
[SPEAKER_00]: to a positive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did these experiments,
if it was taken from a positive mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw something like 90% of those seeds,
90 to 95% of those seeds tested very high
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we grew the plants from those
seeds, we got closer to 20 to 50%,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not every single one of those seeds is
going to become a positive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to risk it,
then you can test the seeds themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, okay, this all came from a positive
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to plant them in my
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a seed manufacturer could actually send
you some seeds then, like five or 10 seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from a batch, and if they all test
negative, feel fairly confident in the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that they're sending out the door,
it sounds like is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they would need to do is segregate
the seeds so that each seed batch was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually representing a single mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then we would expect most of the
seeds taken from that positive mother to
[SPEAKER_00]: test positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if I were growing seeds,
I would definitely be testing my mom's
[SPEAKER_00]: before I fertilize them and the dad's too,
because it can come through to a lesser
[SPEAKER_00]: extent in the pollen and just make sure
that everything is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a question I would ask,
too, if I were purchasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you test the parents of these plants
before you fertilized it?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the testing, testing is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to think of how we can do
this most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better to test the mother's roots,
or is it better to test the progeny,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the seeds from that mother,
if you had to choose, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the economics is a thing,
I would definitely test the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you will know that it came
from a positive mother, and then you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to test the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many tests do I need to do on that
mother plant to feel reliably confident
[SPEAKER_01]: with a certain confidence interval that
the plant is actually clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I realize you send in one test,
it could come back negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean 100% that that plant is
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generally tell people to wait about
three weeks in between testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to get at least two negative tests in
the lifetime of the mother before you
[SPEAKER_00]: either use it in a breeding program or cut
clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would test that mother probably right
when it was a freshly rooted clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then test it again before you decide
to use it in production or to cut clones
[SPEAKER_00]: or fertilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned that not all of the
plants that tested positive of the viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: would express it or have a significant
viroid load in the actual plant itself as
[SPEAKER_01]: it grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you said 20% to 50% was the number
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, can you talk a little
bit about viroid load and what that really
[SPEAKER_01]: means in relation to the media that we're
growing in and the plant itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So viroid load formally means how much
viroid was detected in the tissue that you
[SPEAKER_00]: sent in to sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the test that you have has an
internal control, the test that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, then that can even be normalized
to the total amount of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a proxy for how infected the
plant really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just a mild infection or is it like
on fire with hot blatant viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the research that we've been working
on with statehouse cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, we found that there is a
correlation between a higher viroid load
[SPEAKER_00]: and manifestation of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely find plants that have
an incredibly high viroid load that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: appear to be terribly affected and plants
that have like a medium load, but still
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a pretty significant loss in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, if that viroid load is
high, you're going to see a more affected
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and you're increasing your risk of
spreading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if that plant doesn't look
terribly sick, if there's a ton of viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, then your chances of that plant
spreading it throughout your facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say spreading it too,
my understanding, and please do correct me
[SPEAKER_01]: if I say this wrong, is that it's not
being airborne spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really through the same water,
like sitting in the same water source or
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in the same media or in actual
damage or really rough touching of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you brush against a plant and then
brush against another plant, you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't spread hot blatant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an accurate assumption or is it
more contagious than I realized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to spread hot blatant viroid,
there has to be SAP transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically breakage from the sick plant,
that SAP has to get into a wound,
[SPEAKER_00]: even a micro wound on the healthy plant in
order to transmit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water transmission happens in the root
zone because you have cells that are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sloughing off of the root continuously
and those are releasing viroid into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a potential for insect
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're working on those
experiments at the Colorado State here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that they're finding some
positive results for insect spread as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just touching a plant or having plants
near each other that one's sick and one
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't, isn't necessarily sufficient to
spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this next question is one that comes
from Steve Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine at Green Life
Productions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brought up a good point around this
question in the sense that as we do more
[SPEAKER_01]: testing or as we make hot blatant into a
bigger issue, we're potentially opening
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves up as an industry to greater
regulation and greater testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which puts an undue burden upon growers
and frankly raises the cost of everything
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, I think testing is
important, but are there ways that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively manage this, I guess,
without testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And his hypothesis was that if we are
cycling our plants rapidly and reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid load by growing healthy plants and
cloning off of healthy plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if there was some viroid load in the
plant itself, could we in theory reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: that viroid load cycle after cycle to
where it's a non-factor of any economic
[SPEAKER_01]: importance or virtually disappears,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends a little bit on the viroid
load of the plant that you begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plant that has an
incredibly low level infection or an early
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, what's really happening is that
the infection enters at one spot and then
[SPEAKER_00]: viroids can't move on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have tails or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it moves in the sap with the photo
assimilates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically, you could have a viroid
slowly spreading through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you clone from that plant and take
an area where there isn't a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid and then you continually repeat
that process, you can probably get that
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid down to undetectable levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have had people tell me that they've
done that process and gotten plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have anything and they've had it
for a year and it's still testing
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also had people that tried to do that
and then they thought everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six months later, it started to test
positive again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing to understand about viroids
is they hijack the metabolism of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the plant is growing very
vigorously and it's incredibly healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely going to be better at
fighting off fungal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial pathogens with its innate immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a really healthy, vigorously growing
plant isn't necessarily going to be better
[SPEAKER_00]: at fighting off hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be better at not manifesting
those symptoms quite as dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the faster the plant grows,
the more cells are replicating and
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid is hijacking that process and
also replicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I try to convince people to do when I
talk to them about this issue is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can reduce the amount of testing and still
be effective if you change the way your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother stock is organized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general ag, usually what they have
are nuclear stock, like mothers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: of heightened phytosanitary protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only a few plants that
represent each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the core of your genetic
library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants should be tested all of
the time for anything that could
[SPEAKER_00]: economically destroy your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't have to be thousands of
mother plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two or three plants per strain
and you have, I don't know, 10 strains or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, it's not a huge number of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those plants you can clone production
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point you can start testing
less or you can spot test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to be quite as rigorous
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rigor can go down and down
and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it moves through the production
facility, it's just important to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: center of nuclear mother stock as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that, you reduce the number of
tests, but it's incredibly effective at
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping pathogens from moving down the
production line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see some challenges with that in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just worry in the sense that while we
try to turn our mother stock over because
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets woody, so every cycle we're
usually taking a new mother for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, you can maybe go two cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, it gets really
challenging to keep cloning off the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think your concept still works with
this idea of being hypervigilant about a
[SPEAKER_01]: select number of plants and kind of going
downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept would be, I wouldn't
recommend keeping mother plants more than
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to clone to replace that
mother, you don't clone all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: production plants, all your production
mothers, and then randomly pick a few that
[SPEAKER_00]: will go back and represent your new
special nuclear mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll clone a few plants, and they stay
in that special area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those, you select the one that
will replace that mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a small cycle for your
nuclear stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bigger cycle comes out for your
production mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go basically cloned into all veg
plants at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you continually refresh them,
but you keep it internal into that special
[SPEAKER_00]: group of moms, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a reminder to folks to make sure
you're sanitizing your tools when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: wounding a plant in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Virkon was found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zameer Poonja did some research on
this and found Virkon to be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanitary tool for hoplatin, more so than
bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Virkon 2% was found to be effective in
the research against potato spindle tuber
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid, which comes from the same viroid
family as hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would expect it to be just as
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% bleach has been used in the literature
since 1969 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is generally been shown to be
effective against every viroid in every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species since the beginning of the
time that they've been doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those two, either 2% Virkon,
and do be careful with that because 1% was
[SPEAKER_00]: shown not to be effective, or that 10%
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those seem to work really quite
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, I lost my track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trained a thought with that because I
was thinking about sterilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanted to go back to this mother
stock idea because we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: mother stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking our clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making sure those are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting them out and then hopefully
going from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question was, have we discovered,
has science figured out what triggers this
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viroid to express itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know what environmental factors are
really key in causing expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics of the cultivar is an important
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found plants that were incredibly
susceptible, mildly susceptible,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to plants that were
tolerant, which means that they had a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of viroid and they just didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics is a really important factor
in whether it gets expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress is another thing that tends to
bring out the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants dry out and then on
accident and you water them, the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seem to recover very well,
they tend to be the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat stress, all those different types of
stress can also bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the level of viroid increases
dramatically in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stage of growth is also going to be
something where that's going to bring out
[SPEAKER_00]: those symptoms more because the viroid
level is going up at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize there's different levels of
viroid in the leaf tissue versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots, but is there any difference in
let's say younger tissue versus older
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume older tissue would have
higher viroid loads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be best practice for the clones
that we're keeping in theory to take those
[SPEAKER_01]: off the top of the plant versus lower down
or older growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a viroid enters the plant,
its movement is dictated by something
[SPEAKER_00]: called source to sink, which basically
means it moves from where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to parts of the plant that need
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously going to move towards
new growth because new growth needs energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has to move to the root ball
because the root ball doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge sink on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of this is a little bit of a
guessing game because you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: know when the plant was infected and you
don't know which tissue represented a sink
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time the plant was infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did this in our study,
we did find higher viroid load in the
[SPEAKER_00]: older growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably because when the plant
was infected, that growth was a sink
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it moved there and then it's been
replicating in there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a weird guessing game because it
really depends on where the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: initially infected and what tissues were
sources and what tissues were sinks at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a really good answer for
you, I'm afraid, because it just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the how that plant was infected
and the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to know if there was
something new that I hadn't heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What areas of the country are you seeing
hoplatent the most and or other pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a difficult question because
obviously there is a lot of cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people are testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a lot of data from
California, Colorado, Oregon, showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of hoplatent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have customers all across the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single state in which we were
able to have enough data to make the call,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've detected hoplatent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say at this point that it's
more specific in any part of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also detected it in Canada,
Thailand, South Africa, all across Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of a global pathogen at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter where you're getting
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something everybody is dealing with
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it higher in any particular type of
media or style of growing like outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: versus indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing it more in chemical grows
versus organics, anything like that at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point in time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it sort of agnostic and everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely say it's agnostic
because it's an intercellular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cares a lot less about the media or the
environmental conditions as opposed to big
[SPEAKER_00]: funguses or whatever that can be impacted
by a lot of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we don't see a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely get less data from outdoor
grows than we do from indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's affecting all plants at this
point, no matter how you're growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only real method for cleaning a
plant right now that I'm aware of is
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how effective is tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's something that we've been
talking about for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems more challenging in cannabis for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's real world like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing a lot of success there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it proving to be more challenging
than people realize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to remove hoplite and
viroids with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of tissue culture that you have
to do to remove it is not a beginner's
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely has differences in
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The success rate is different depending on
which strain you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've definitely seen companies that
were able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants have been clean for more
than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just depends on the expertise
of the company that's doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's going to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to submit plants for tissue
culture that have a lower viroid load.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I think one of the first steps
that they would take is to try to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that load down before they do the tissue
culture process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a long time because you have
to keep that plant for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're doing it right,
they're continually testing and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it was successful before they
give it back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process can take like six months,
sometimes even a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depending on how high the viroid load
was in the beginning and differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love a strain and you don't want to
lose it and you're willing to give it the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and the money to clean it,
you can do it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware it's a lengthy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend someone just go out
and get a tissue culture hood and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it yourself because it's pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you choose not to answer it,
you can choose not to answer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these companies that you worked with,
that you saw good success with,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you comfortable naming them to at
least point people in a direction for
[SPEAKER_01]: going down that path if they wish to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys send me an email, I will give
you the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just send us a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get a kickback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a monetary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know there are some companies that
do really good science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very rigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you guys want to know,
feel free to send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're happy to give you some
recommendations on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's kind of switch direction here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tumi has developed a on-site,
so like in-field sort of HLVD testing
[SPEAKER_01]: platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you talk about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little about how it might
work and what the benefits are for growers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have created an on-site testing
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal with that was to provide
growers with similar sensitivity and
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy as an in-lab PCR, but kind of
give them the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can run the test themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see the results after an hour or
two and make decisions that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the efficiency of their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the test itself, it's a version of
isothermal amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've made a lot of changes to sort of
the base technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we wanted to provide the
cannabis facility was not just an on-site
[SPEAKER_00]: test that works, but something that really
pushes the limits of what's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: with that type of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to incorporate,
I think probably one of the most critical
[SPEAKER_00]: things is an internal control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is if you run the test
and there was a mistake made or the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't any good or maybe the reagents
weren't good or whatever, the test will
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't get a false negative and have
that false sense of security.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that that needs to be rerun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's negative, you'll get a green,
the test will glow green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's positive, it'll glow somewhere
between a yellow to a red kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on viroid load.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ways that we've changed the
chemistry have allowed us to bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity to an incredibly high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to detect four viroid
particles per microliter, which comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 95, 96% of all of the tests that
we find with QPCR in lab, high complexity
[SPEAKER_00]: would also be detected by this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you the confidence that if you
get a negative result with that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity and the fact that you can tell
the difference between a failed test and a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative test, that you can feel pretty
confident that that plant is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: negative or at least the tissue that you
detected is or collected is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we tried really hard
on was to make this easy because growers
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't molecular biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect you to know how to use a
pipette or know what the difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: between 10 microliters and a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken all the complexity out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pipettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no scientific knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample prep is all integrated into the
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put some root in tube, you close
the lid, you shake it up, just like our in
[SPEAKER_00]: lab tests, and then it's ready to be run
in the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not hard at all to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes with a device that calls the
results for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no ambiguity there,
whether it's positive, negative,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, oh, maybe it kind of changed color or
it's glowing a little bit, the device will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes with a software that will
give you a dashboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only will you get the results,
they'll be organized digitally and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: track positivity for you over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sort it by room, by strain,
by user, by facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have something to, if you need to
send reports off, you have something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can print out to show them how the
facility is doing with their pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also print the reports out and
give them to customers if they're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones or your seeds to show them
that you've tested and it has all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: results in there so that you can give your
customers that extra confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've tried our very best to
build a system that's accurate,
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive, easy to use, and provides the
type of convenience that I think growers
[SPEAKER_00]: need in order for it to be something that
they can help them economically and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize in their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You answered a lot of the questions I was
going to ask you about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to be a scientist to use
the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just do a little bit of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take for me to,
say, take a sample of root and run through
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole process and get a result?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to collect the root, we've timed
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get pretty good at it,
you can do it in about 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask that people take four pieces of
root about an inch long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it in half, put it in a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes, it depends on the root
system, obviously, 30 seconds maybe per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you shake it up and you move 40
microliters of liquid using the
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized transfer stick that we provide
into the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do an entire plate of that in
maybe 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it sits in the heat block for 90
minutes, but that's downtime for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit start, you can walk away,
you can go to lunch, you can do whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it beeps and turns itself off when
it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the analysis bit, you can do an
entire plate takes maybe a minute at the
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of depends on how many people
you have collecting samples, but hands-on
[SPEAKER_00]: time for an entire plate, maybe two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say an entire plate, that means
you're running multiple samples at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're referencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plates hold 48 samples at a time,
and that's only limited by the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat blocks you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have four heat blocks,
then you could do four times as many
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by far the most time-consuming part of
this is actually just sample collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the same if you were
doing an in-lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part that takes the most time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But running the test itself is minimal
time commitment once you have those
[SPEAKER_00]: samples collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could I run, save six tests at a time
though, and save the other 42 to run
[SPEAKER_01]: another cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run one test all the way up to
multiple plates at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to ask all the questions I
think people might ask after listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people are going to want to
know what is this cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should probably talk about that just
to get it out of the way for folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the pricing here,
but do you want to tackle that and cover
[SPEAKER_01]: that, or do you want me to just- Sure,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a one-time cost for the device
itself that's around 4,800.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only paid once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes with the device,
the heat block, all of the trays and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to help with the organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reactions themselves range between $10
up to $18 per reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just depends on bulk at that
point, how many reactions you want to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the $18 is the high price,
but it comes down pretty quickly if you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy 100 reactions or 200 reactions and it
keeps going down like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the cost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The device hopefully will be detecting
multiple pathogens soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there'll be multiple kits that you
could purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like the, like you said,
the starter kit, $47.75 US for the starter
[SPEAKER_01]: kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes with the device,
collection tube rack, and two reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: tube racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a dry bath and Wi-Fi adapter are the
components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the testing kit, it looks like
the minimum size is $864.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which works out to $18 a kit for 48 kits,
which you said you don't have to use all
[SPEAKER_01]: at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned bulk options.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question there is like, how long could
I store this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how am I storing these reaction kits
if I wanted to like stock up to save
[SPEAKER_01]: money, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can store them for six months if
you pop them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more stable in the fridge than
they would be on the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some freezer space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the reactions themselves are very
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take the reactions out of the
box and put them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's almost indefinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them for up to a year and
they're fine in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on what kind of storage
options you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have like a little mini fridge
or a mini freezer, you can stock up quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say indefinite, what's my range
between a year and indefinite of probably
[SPEAKER_01]: having kits that are still good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't recommend keeping them for
more than a year, but the accelerated
[SPEAKER_00]: stability studies that we did show that
even if you keep them for a year in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge, we didn't see any decrease in
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would try to use them up within the
year, but the data we have doesn't suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would be bad if you use them
after 13 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the issue sensitivity or is the issue
potential kit failure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you get a failed message back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you keep it for too long,
you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the kit just automatically fail?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of a COVID test, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that you do these accelerated
stability studies is you kind of heat them
[SPEAKER_00]: up to a higher temperature and then you
push the test to its limit of detection
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask how long can it sit and still
capture near the sensitivity that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also increase the number of
fails if some components of the test
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't working as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you would see is sort
of a decrease in sensitivity, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: might see a higher percentage of fails
also if you push it past the expiration
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have, it looks like publicly
available data on this that people can
[SPEAKER_01]: really dive into that are interested in
learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just touch on a couple things
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at a graph or a table,
sorry, that shows the percent detection
[SPEAKER_01]: success based on HLVD concentration in the
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what that
graph or table is showing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm referencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that you determine the
sensitivity of one of these molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: tests is that you create a gradient of
viroid amount from a whole bunch to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down to basically nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do a bunch of tests in each
of the different levels, and you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: show that you have 95% success of
detection in order to find that range
[SPEAKER_00]: where the test works and then the range
where it kind of falls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the way it's done if
you're trying to do a human diagnostic or
[SPEAKER_00]: a diagnostic in any other industry where
these types of things are standard and
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran 20 or 30 tests at multiple
different levels of viroid, and we pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: it until we hit the point where we got
that 95% success, but we pushed it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more and we went down, I think it
was 80, then 50, and then we lost it or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you kind of determine that
special zone where you can detect down to
[SPEAKER_00]: that level with 95% confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, it was four viroid
particles per microliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went down to two and one,
you can still find it now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not 95% confident or 95% success
or better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you did other tests looking at
different organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notably, Pythium, Botrytis, Rhizectonia,
Fusarium, all of these different organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: and cross-reactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a variety of
percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain what I'm looking at to me
here in terms of what these percentages
[SPEAKER_01]: really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this test, we did the
cross-reactivity interference both in that
[SPEAKER_00]: table that you're looking at, which is a
bioinformatic analysis, and then we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: wet lab analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the bioinformatic analysis,
you take the sequences that are used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the test to find hoplatin viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you want those sequences
to find hoplatin viroid, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to find any other pathogens that
might be present or the cannabis genome
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look through the genome of each of
these different organisms, and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the sequences you're using to
find hoplatin wouldn't also find those
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those percentages are the highest
percent overlap between the sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using to find hoplatin and all of
those other organisms that we've looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bar there is 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bar set by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go below 80%, then it's not
bioinformatically predicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-react.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we did was a wet lab
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we just actually took that
organism and we put it in a tube with the
[SPEAKER_00]: test and said, OK, do we A, find it if we
don't add hoplatin viroid, and B,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it interfere with the detection of
hoplatin viroid when hoplatin viroid is
[SPEAKER_00]: really low, but there's tons of fusarium
or pythium?
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't find any interference or
cross-reactivity in our wet lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had a plant with fusarium or media
with fusarium and I pulled a brood out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there, I should still get an accurate test
result or trichoderma, pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You list a whole bunch of different
pathogens in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You answered that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question I had was interfering
substance studies that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at growing medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, this is one of the most
important analyses because growers use a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the big question is,
I just sprayed sulfur on my plants or I
[SPEAKER_00]: got some cocoa in the tube or I use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to interfere with this test?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set out to ask that of a ton of
different substances that people might
[SPEAKER_00]: use, from IPM substances to different
growing mediums to different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization and identified the ones
where using at an incredibly high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration do interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them didn't interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that did interfere, we did follow
up studies to see what level the
[SPEAKER_00]: interference would begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can formulate recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, soil tends to interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil has a lot of PCR inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have large amounts of soil on
the roots, just for soil specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we recommend people wipe that soil off or
clean it in some water before putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important that you do all of
those studies so growers know,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I just used this particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I still do this or do I have to wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried really hard to think of
everything that might be in the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make sure that it wouldn't
interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it did, we provide advice on when to
test the plant so they're not testing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting a bunch of fails and having to
do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize, ultimately, this product is
not going to be for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more specific to people growing on a
pretty large scale to make it worth it to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this level of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope that folks that tuned in,
even home growers, learned a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more about toplate and viroid and
pathogens in general and can take that
[SPEAKER_01]: back into their grow system and make
improvements as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really thank you for your time and
sharing your knowledge.
