[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hudson, KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's topic, mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now, practically everyone has heard of
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible fungus that forms a
symbiotic relationship with the roots of
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see a lot of misinformation and
claims out there about it, and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a good topic to dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: After checking this out, if you want to
learn more, I do have a blog post on our
[SPEAKER_00]: website at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the Learn tab or just type myco,
m-y-c-o into the search tab, scroll down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll see the blog post as well as an
interview I did episode 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first heard about mycorrhizal fungi from
my dear friend, Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been great at sharing exciting
new findings in the microbial world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and his most recent book, Teaming with
Bacteria, talks about rhizophagy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a much more recent discovery about how
bacteria can travel into root cells by
[SPEAKER_00]: infecting the cells at the root tip
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once inside the root, these bacteria lose
their cell walls and essentially leak
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before leaving again through the root
tips, reforming their cell walls again in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere and cycling over and over
again as a way of creating nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mycorrhizal fungi wasn't a recent
discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between fungi and plant
roots was written about as early as 1885,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new research over the last century
learned a lot about this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, we now know that mycorrhizal
fungi exists in almost all ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: ranging from deserts to tropical forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 90% of plants have a mycorrhizal
relationship, but mycorrhizal fungi have
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for over 400 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff is a stickler for proper
terminology, and so I wanted to start
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myco means fungus, rhizo means root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycology is the study of fungi,
and mushrooms are the fruiting body of
[SPEAKER_00]: some fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that rhizo mean roots,
terms like rhizosphere, the area around
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, becomes more clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizal fungi is the proper term
for the specific fungi that form a
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship with the roots of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae is the actual association
between roots and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's subtle, but there is a difference
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're referring to just the fungi,
then you should say mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're referring to the relationship,
then it's mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relationship makes a ton of sense
from a plant and ecology perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant roots are hospitable sites for fungi
to anchor to and produce hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots provide essential nutrients to
assist in the growth of the fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fungal biomass acts as an
extension or virtual root system for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, increasing the amount of water and
nutrients the plant can obtain from the
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually increases the absorbing
surface area of the roots by up to 40
[SPEAKER_00]: times what it would be without this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in regards to soil health,
there's enhanced soil tilt, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference to the physical properties of
the soil and its suitability for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also improves carbon sequestration and
the transfer of water and nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, like I already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good research showing that for
plants that have this mutualistic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, that you'll see numerous
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, mycorrhizal fungi gets
associated with improved phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, and that's certainly true,
phosphorus being key for root growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, and cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also leads to greater nutrient
uptake of other nutrients and much more
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One such mineral is sulfur, which plays a
key role in plant metabolism, the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of proteins, vitamins,
and amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the formation of certain volatile
sulfur terpenes like the skunk smell in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal symbiosis can improve
photosynthesis and photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments, the plant's ability to combat
various abiotic stressors like drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity, cold temperatures, and heavy
metal stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also plays a role in plant protection
from microbial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, something that I didn't
know before I started researching this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast was that many desert plants have a
mycorrhizal relationship and would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this coevolutionary perspective
that I think is really interesting from an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many different types of
mycorrhizal fungi, and it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think that you could just go buy
any mycoproduct and you'd be good to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a bit more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four main types of mycorrhizal
fungi that I'm familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: endo-mycorrhizal fungi, ecto-mycorrhizal
fungi, aricoid-mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and orchid-mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip over aricoid as it has very
limited usage and there's only one
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available product that I'm
aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it forms a symbiotic
relationship with plants like blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: cranberries, rhododendrons, azaleas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less important for gardeners and
cannabis growers since it does not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchid-mycorrhizal fungi is also pretty
self-explanatory, forming a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with orchids, so we'll skip that one as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecto-mycorrhizal fungi, which is a more
common type of mycorrhizal fungi and found
[SPEAKER_00]: in many commercial mycorrhizal blends,
mostly because it's quite easy to culture
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitro compared to other types.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of ecto-mycorrhizal fungi
belong to classes like basidiomycetes or
[SPEAKER_00]: ascomycetes and form fruiting bodies like
mushrooms, puffballs, and toadstools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truffles, interestingly enough,
are ecto-mycorrhizal, forming a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with specific tree roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically when I think of ecto-mycorrhizal
fungi, I think of conifers and forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecto-mycorrhizal fungi help provide host
trees with nutrients from the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: water in exchange for plant carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecto means outer, which is helpful and
remember that ecto-mycorrhizal fungi sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of form a sheath around the roots,
extending out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool for forest restoration and when
you typically see those photos of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant roots, with all those little white
hyphae coming off of it, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ecto-mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo-mycorrhizal fungi is the one we want
to focus on as a gardener, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis or tomatoes or fruit
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo means internal or within and
endo-mycorrhizal fungi infects within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cortical cells and grows intercellularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, aricoid and orchid mycorrhizal
fungi are both endo-mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the most commonly heard type
you'll hear about is VAM, which stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizal or AM or
AM, which is a shorter name that just
[SPEAKER_00]: shortens it down to Arbuscular
Mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: AM fungi are the most common and abundant
of endo-mycorrhizal fungi and are
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized by the formation of
arbuscules or hyphal coils within cortical
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbuscules is just a fancy word for the
shape, picture the top half of a deciduous
[SPEAKER_00]: tree with all its branches reaching out,
and hyphal coils are exactly what it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like, fungal hyphae that form
coils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cortical cells or the cortex is the
outer layer of the stem or root in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular plant like cannabis, right below
the epidermis but outside the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, arbuscular mycorrhizae form
mycelium that extends out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These arbuscules or hyphal coils are the
main sites for nutrient exchange between
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found this really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was research done in 2011 entitled
Reciprocal Rewards Stabilized Cooperation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Mycorrhizal Symbiosis by Kears out
of the Netherlands that looked at how this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship works and what makes it
mutualistic or symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between plants and fungi
and other soil microorganisms is really
[SPEAKER_00]: complex and there's a lot of potential for
exploitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean realistically, each organism is
looking out for their own best interests,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how do they keep this relationship fair
for both parties?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that plants can detect,
discriminate, and reward the best fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: partners with more carbohydrates,
while the mycorrhizal fungi can enforce
[SPEAKER_00]: their end of the relationship by
increasing nutrient transfer only to the
[SPEAKER_00]: host plant roots providing the most
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this checks and balances system has
evolved between these fungi and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to allow them to co-evolve,
which is really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mentioned before that
ectomycorrhizal fungi can be grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: vitro, in a lab, but endomycorrhizal fungi
requires a plant host.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it much more challenging to
grow and therefore we see much lower spore
[SPEAKER_00]: counts in commercial products relative to
ectomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand because it's
not as simple as just buying a product
[SPEAKER_00]: because it contains mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure you're buying the
right type of mycorrhizal fungi for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and in high enough concentrations to
actually get mycorrhizal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many fertilizer or soil companies will add
just a tiny amount of mycorrhizal fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: their product just to get it on the label,
but not enough to make any difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to actual infection in a
reasonable time frame for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endomycorrhizal fungi will also vary based
on the species of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common is Glomus interirratices,
also known as rhizophagus irregularis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bear with me with all my
pronunciations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best, but they're
probably not all going to be perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm gonna apologize for that in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also see Glomus massiae,
Glomus agregatum, Glomus deserticola,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to further complicate matters,
depending on where you source the fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll end up with a different strain of
the same species of rhizophagus
[SPEAKER_00]: irregularis, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Yoram Kapulnik from the Volkani
Institute, who is a soil scientist that
[SPEAKER_00]: specializes in rhizosphere interactions,
talks about how the product dinomyco was
[SPEAKER_00]: created by isolating a native strain in
Israel that was quite resilient and more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective at greater pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the strains will be more effective
or resistant to drought or flooding or
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature ranges, so you can't assume
that you'll get the same results just
[SPEAKER_00]: because the name of the mycorrhizal
species is the same on two different
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, there's very few
companies that actually are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially produce and sell
endomycorrhizal fungi, so most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply in North America is coming from a
few suppliers and everyone is just
[SPEAKER_00]: repacking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is some of the research, though,
on mycorrhizal fungi in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The research is pretty mixed, but I wanted
to highlight some papers that I found
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2022, a paper entitled Enhancement of
Growth and Cannabinoids Content of Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Sativa Using Arbuscular
Mycorrhizal Fungi by Wasan Seemakram out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Thailand looked at the effects of
applying two different species of
[SPEAKER_00]: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, rhizophagus
prolifer and rhizophagus aggregatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and compared it to a non-mycorrhizal
control in plants that received a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 60 days, mycorrhizal plants
outperformed non-mycorrhizal plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: stem height, stem diameter, stem dry
weight, number of branches, and number of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants inoculated with rhizophagus
prolifer did not perform as well as those
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated with rhizophagus aggregatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrations of CBD and THC were also
highest in plants inoculated with
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizophagus aggregatus, while those that
were inoculated with rhizophagus prolifer
[SPEAKER_00]: and the synthetic fertilizer variants only
had intermediate concentrations of THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another paper from 2021 entitled Effect
of Rhizophagus Irregularis on Growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality of Cannabis Sativa Seedlings that
was produced by the Laboratory of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agronomy, Department of Crop Science,
Agricultural University of Athens measured
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and phosphorus content,
root and stem length and weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and survival rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was that the biomass of
the seedlings' roots, the fresh weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nitrogen content were not affected
by the mycorrhizal colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, root length, stem dry weight,
survival rate, and phosphorus content were
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly increased by 5%,
24.3%, and 12.4% respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was using treatments with rates
of 40, 80, and 120 fungal spores per liter
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrient solution of rhizophagus
irregularis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fairly high rates, certainly much
higher than you would see in any soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer with it on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the second half of this podcast,
I want to dive into the practical and
[SPEAKER_00]: actionable questions regarding mycorrhizal
fungi, such as the best way to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi or incorporate into your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to apply it every cycle if
you're reusing your media?
[SPEAKER_00]: What role does mycorrhizal fungi play in
heavy metal uptake?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it really take for
infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, my opinion on whether or not
you should be using mycorrhizal fungi in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow based on the research I've seen.
