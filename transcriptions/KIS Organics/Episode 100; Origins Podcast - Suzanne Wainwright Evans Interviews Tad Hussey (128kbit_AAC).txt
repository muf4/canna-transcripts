[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to do for our 100th
episode and my friend Suzanne,
[SPEAKER_00]: who you all know as the Bug Lady,
convinced me to let her flip the tables
[SPEAKER_00]: and interview me to share a bit more about
myself, how this podcast came to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of what I've learned from my
amazing guests I've had the privilege of
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewing over the past four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started the podcast,
I really didn't know if anyone would tune
[SPEAKER_00]: in to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of writing this introduction,
we are at almost two million unique
[SPEAKER_00]: downloads of the podcast since we
launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful to all the folks who have
reached out and shared their success
[SPEAKER_00]: stories or how something they learned on
the podcast has improved their growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the beginning, I've avoided ads and
sponsors because I wanted to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast accessible and free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to support us, please consider
going to kissorganics.com and check out
[SPEAKER_00]: our growing list of products ranging from
soils and amendments to beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: or reaching out for any consulting needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what allows us to keep the podcast
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, enough on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited to be here with you,
Tad, for this hundredth episode because I
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I did nag Tad about this a
little bit because he wasn't exactly keen
[SPEAKER_01]: on doing this at first, but I really
thought people would be interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: learning more about you because I think
you're super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put you in the old souls category
of people that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you're a very genuine, kind human
being.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrilled to call you a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think the world would want to know
more about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a very nice introduction,
Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was your idea and want to do
something different for the hundredth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to ask you anything too
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all know you as kind of like the
soils guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you actually go to school for this
or did you do something different first?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with my parents owning a nursery
and landscaping business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been around plants my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not interested in plants until later
in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my undergrad degree at the
University of Washington after
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring from Gonzaga with a degree in
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a minor in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went on and got a master's
degree at Macquarie University in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia in special education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't really have any degrees
related to horticulture or agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been sort of self taught through
the industry and reading and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that having a master's
degree was really, really helpful in
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to read and understand
scientific journals and statistics and
[SPEAKER_00]: what research is actually saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think understanding education and
how to teach also has made you able to
[SPEAKER_01]: teach people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this is what you're doing
through your podcast and through talks you
[SPEAKER_01]: give and conversations is you are teaching
people and being able to communicate that
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable information is super important
because people can be super smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can't communicate it,
it makes it very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just feel lucky that I have
this platform that allows me to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: really great guests that are, you know,
amazing experts in their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just get to ask them the questions
that I think hopefully every grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking as the person's talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kind of questions that I
want to try and pull out of them and make
[SPEAKER_00]: this information more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the goal of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, so you graduate, you know,
you're thinking you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I meet you, you're a soils guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get from thinking about being
an educator into soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I haven't heard your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all I didn't know where this
interview was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I came back with a special
ed degree and wasn't able to use it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without going back to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, that's it's a really tough
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in special education for a while
and it's it's really easy to get burned
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of respect for people who do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, my parents were shutting
down their nursery, their plant nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my dad had started a compost tea
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, I was looking for
jobs in other fields and I wasn't having
[SPEAKER_00]: much success finding something I enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually working at Redwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Robin as a server for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got involved with my dad's
business and I started learning all about
[SPEAKER_00]: what he was doing with compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really interesting part for me was
the microscopy and the micro the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started learning more about that
and it just kind of kept expanding into
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and minerals and, you know,
other aspects of, I guess, fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: around around plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long have you had your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't officially own it until
about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running it since, oh,
boy, 2006, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my parents owned it up until a couple
of years ago when they finally sold it to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole time we had the farm and
starting Kiss Organics and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running the business, but my parents
officially owned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a nice transition because
it's always nice to have like a legacy to
[SPEAKER_01]: pass on to your children because you see
sometimes great businesses and the
[SPEAKER_01]: children aren't interested and the
businesses end up folding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always feel like we're losing a
piece of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes me very happy that,
you know, it's able to continue on for
[SPEAKER_01]: another generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're doing such a a great job with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but like with your customer base,
who's your furthest customer that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: ship to or work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, currently, if we work with some
people in Maine, that seems pretty far
[SPEAKER_00]: away from us here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our largest customers for a while
was in Puerto Rico until freight got too
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous to be able to ship to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, we work with people all around
all around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, we try to find people more
locally to work with just because of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the sustainability of shipping
material around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I guess I guess all over,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had a customer that the situation
you deal with they're dealing with was
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally challenging and you guys
were able to like finally come to a
[SPEAKER_01]: resolution to to help them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know I run into some really
challenging problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always very satisfying at the end of
the day when you can help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, you know, one of those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do we do some consulting on the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of them originally was a
consulting agreement was with Mike over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Maincraft Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was dealing with a lot of these
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally were able to sort some things
out and come to a resolution to where now
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go check out his page, you can see
he's he's an excellent grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he was dealing with was was a
starting soil material that was
[SPEAKER_00]: excessively high in nitrates and just very
unbalanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took us a little while to figure
out what was going on before we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we did, he's just been off and
running ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been up to his facility and I
will have to say I just finished up my
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought me a bag of chocolate covered
almonds from L.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw him a couple of weeks ago in
Ohio and I just finished him up,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mike, because I know Mike's going
to listen to this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you're being successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of a sudden, how do you end up
having this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say a media empire,
but I feel like you're on your way to
[SPEAKER_01]: having a media empire, to having this
amazing podcast that everybody listens to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I think you're giving us a little
too much credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like we're the smallest guys
and the smallest fish in the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast has been great, you know,
and I'm very grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're not a large business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six of us total at Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were larger when I had the
farm and feed store and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've really leaned down to just a
really a core group of awesome folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we're we're really pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, I'm a company of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a big company to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we work with we partnered
with a soil mixing facility about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and it's been the best relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really close to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do an awesome job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love working with them, but it gives
us the infrastructure and capability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to mix at scale, to mix, you know,
a thousand yards if we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly and have control over the
operations without having all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure cost of setting up an
entire facility like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been wonderful to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really allowed us to sort of
focus our energies not on the the day to
[SPEAKER_00]: day production side, but really on
customer service and helping folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on that end of things and really
dialing in the fertility side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science side of everything, which is the
fun part for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, how'd you end up with the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the podcast was because I oh,
boy, this was back in like 2008,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I first met my my dear friend,
Jaya Palmer, I was learning about all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and I was having trouble finding
good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having come out of, you know, sort of that
nursery side of things and horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just so different than what I was
learning in the forums, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: reading about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two were just so completely
different that I really wanted to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: like marry the two in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, OK, I want to I want to
eventually like write a book from
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've learned and share that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, like as I was doing
this, I was like, I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one reads books anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasts were becoming a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, like if I did write a book,
I didn't know I'd battle with imposter
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I talked about this and the idea
of like I would want to have people come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and write chapters for me because they
know a subject so much better than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was thinking more and more about
it and actually have some chapters that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written out that I've turned in the
blogs on our on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, I know people like Jeff
Lowenfels and at the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackens coot or these people that other
growers want to hear from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not create a platform where I can just
interview them and let them speak to what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that, you know, they do and what
people want to hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the podcast has grown, I've it's
kind of been a lot of like word of mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: from my guests and kind of putting me in
touch with more and more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's gotten, I think, more
scientific as I've gone along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I get podcast requests
every every week from people wanting to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really now only I only take on new
guests from people that have like know
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that was already a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you've been one of the main
people who have helped me in sourcing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these guests, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's where it started,
wanting to like kind of combine and bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: the gap between horticulture and what was
going on in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's just so much more
information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier to get access to good
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people ask to be on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that was a thing because
I've never gone to somebody said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I want to be on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know we were supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we were supposed to be asked to
be on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, a lot of people work with
marketing firms and those marketing firms
[SPEAKER_00]: will reach out and email you and say,
hey, here's my they're the CEO,
[SPEAKER_00]: so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make, you know, rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the highest, best technology and
rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this has nothing to do with
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not, you know, I'm not really
interested, but I get I get them all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so I need to hire a marketing firm for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know from hearing your amazing,
amazing talk you did a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: at the biocontrol conference that you have
worked hard to build a very scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: platform on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was totally blown away by
your presentation and you talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: your transition on I don't want to say
learning science, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you know science, but just on
becoming more of a critical thinker about
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with doing that,
are there things that you are doing today
[SPEAKER_01]: to help improve?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, how do you make yourself
smarter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we we try to be science based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not perfect, but we we really try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like science is such a
polarizing word these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think it's it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's it's agnostic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just this idea of applying a
way of thinking to come to a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the thing that kills me
about the cannabis industry is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just such a there's such a mix between
marketing hype and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets it gets very, very murky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to determine as a as a
grower or as an end user, like what what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really need to grow a healthy plant
and then how to go about finding those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we we try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be honest, like it I mean,
my talk was basically like how to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: see through some of the marketing hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it drives me it drives me crazy when I
go online and see the ads or what people
[SPEAKER_00]: are saying and the claims around some of
these products that I that I know are not
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, they're they're selling
millions of dollars of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably why we get along so well,
Tad, because I feel your pain every day on
[SPEAKER_01]: that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same same kind of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with your podcast, what has been like
what are your favorite episodes and
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite topics that you've done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there's been a lot of great
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed my interviews with you,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think learning about something that I
don't know a lot about, which is bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely learned a lot more about
insects from talking to you over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now working with bio B, I'm learning
even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to, because now that we're offering
bugs to customers, that's been something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not the main person on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have Brandon, who's really been
spearheading that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm learning more as as customers are
asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm listening in on the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the one with Dr. Yoram
Kapulnik on mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Dr. Wendy Zellner on Silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking for someone to explain
Silicon for years, and she was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that podcast to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one with like my mentor on the
horticulture side, Don Marshall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy and just the way he looks
at plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did one with my good friend,
Justin McGill, Dr. Ben Higgins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talking to like growers and
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, I just went back about
two weeks ago and re listened to my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast with Jaya Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away last year, and that was
really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to hear his voice again was
really, really special for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so knowing that that's preserved and
people can hear him, that meant a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm very sorry about losing your
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, life's just not fair,
you know, but it's great that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, I just want to say,
you know, if you have someone out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's struggling with addiction,
like please reach out to them and be a
[SPEAKER_00]: resource for them and realize,
too, that when you see people that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, struggling or down and out,
like know that they're they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: human and they're passionate and
intelligent and creative and loved like
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's easy to just walk by and
see it, you know, because you see
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction everywhere, unfortunately,
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's hard to have compassion for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I just want to mention that
because Jaya was a really special guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was very like neurodivergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I don't think the world
is really the kindest place to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I know it's off topic,
but I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but I mean, it's a good message in
today's day and age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what a great gift you have
given the world by preserving that
[SPEAKER_01]: interview with him because it's preserved
forever now and it will be available
[SPEAKER_01]: forever out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why I like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's the big reason that we have kiss
organics in terms of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he he came over when I was working
out of my dad's garage, literally mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil on a tarp because he wanted to grab
some compost tea supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like here, you know,
take some soil back because he was running
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottled nutrient program at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, just try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back, you know, a couple of
months later telling me how wonderful it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I was we kind of like work
together to try and like formulate this
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mix and, you know, try it in
different size containers and different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the one that really pushed this
all forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm eternally grateful for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like kiss organics probably wouldn't exist
if it weren't for Jaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on a more interesting, let's move
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could have anybody alive or gone,
you know, if you wanted Thomas Jefferson,
[SPEAKER_01]: who would be the one person your dream
guest of all time to have on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've thought about this not from
that perspective, but the people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to get eventually on the
podcast, Paul Stamets, I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: have him come on and talk about fungus
just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think Michael Pollan would be
really interesting because I've read all
[SPEAKER_00]: of his books and some of his things around
plants, I think is really great,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would probably be the first two
that come to mind for me in terms of like
[SPEAKER_00]: famous people that I don't have access to
that I would love to get on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, both of those would be amazing
because I've read Michael's books,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, which, you know, with all the plant
history and everything, but also Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Stamets, you know, I'm, you know,
being a Star Trek fan and they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Paul Stamets is now in Star
Trek, you know, doing the Mycelia Web and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they tied that all in, you know,
yeah, I'm a bigger fan because of the Star
[SPEAKER_01]: Trek tie in now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those would be two very
interesting people to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, you know, with the podcast being
part of social media, because it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: all I don't want to say it all ties in
together, but, you know, go into social
[SPEAKER_01]: media for advice on growing, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's it's interesting
because nowadays we don't have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: connection and social media really is that
tool for connection in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other ways, I think it's awful in terms
of advice for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the best tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, interestingly enough,
we've been posting every Tuesday a weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: plant trivia photo or video and folks are,
you know, able to kind of guess at what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all in good fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the answers,
you can see how much it varies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and if it's an insect,
it can be anywhere from spider mites to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips to aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you post, you know, a photo of a
leaf, people are like, oh, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus deficiency or magnesium or
calcium or, you know, pretty much anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows how hard it is to one,
even die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, get like consistent advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's not enough information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put enough information in your
post for someone to give you a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, like even,
you know, trying to diagnose something
[SPEAKER_00]: remotely as a consultant, I think is
really challenging because you almost have
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk into the room and see everything
that's going on because you may spot
[SPEAKER_00]: something out of the corner of your eye
and be like, oh, well, this is this isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might be what's causing this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's I think it's very tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd back you up 100 percent on that as
being a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I am not a miracle worker when
it comes to diagnosing problems from bad
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a challenge out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think everything you're
doing to try to put good information out
[SPEAKER_01]: is super helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very challenging, though,
because, you know, you have a daily
[SPEAKER_01]: business to run and, you know,
doing the podcast and then trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: up with all the social media stuff can be
very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do give you credit for actually
doing a good job for keeping up with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, I'm a little challenged
sometimes with that on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you and I have the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have to be the marketing
department and the social media department
[SPEAKER_00]: and the technical department and all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, I have more help than you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will spend as much time with a
person with two plants as I do with a
[SPEAKER_00]: person with a thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really do try and answer everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a message, you know,
through social media, I will answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not always be like a super in-depth
answer, but I always get back to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: and really try my hardest to help as many
people as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, you guys do a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that, you know, thinking about
the business and there's a lot of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that is out of our control with
our businesses that are affecting us for
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see as some of the biggest
challenges coming up for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, it's been all over the board
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, over the last two years with
everything with COVID and supply chain
[SPEAKER_00]: shortages, it's been getting things,
material and then cost increases with
[SPEAKER_00]: inflation and then freight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freight's been the killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so hard to ship things because
of the cost of freight lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably our biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been trying to work on helping
people source things locally, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and making recommendations that allow them
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even that's a little bit challenging
because when we go to make a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to build it around the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I don't know what your starting
compost is or if it's not high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes it really challenging to build a
soil and also build a safe product because
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to know the heavy metal levels now
that we have heavy metal testing in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just it's more complicated,
I think, than people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been looking into other options
because we have people reach out and are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, you know, I don't want to use
anything that comes from the industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, egg or slaughterhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to or anything from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to use vegan inputs or I
want things that are more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want those things, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of figuring out how to
maintain our fertility and our plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health, because I don't want to sacrifice
those things either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a balance because as we move,
for example, phosphorus, the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of phosphorus are bone meal,
fish bone meal, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, relatively low and
heavy metals, but they're not maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: source from an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a waste product from an industry
that maybe you don't want to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we start looking into other things
where you can get them like, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: insect frass or some some plant based
products that are high higher in P or even
[SPEAKER_00]: mined materials like soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're looking at heavy metal
levels that may be higher than we want in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to get our phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it I guess it can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been trying to find replacements
for peat, but I haven't found anything yet
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can put my kiss organics seal
of approval or whatever on and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I can get the same level of
growth or get near the same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth as I can using peat moss in my mix.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a constant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on this for years and I
hope we get there, but it's been tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen it with a lot of growers
trialing all kinds of inputs who are just
[SPEAKER_01]: even conventional growers, not even to
have this special niche and the standards
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys have just trying to find a
replacement for peat and trying to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been very challenging for the
whole horticultural industry to find these
[SPEAKER_01]: replacements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, over time, you know,
we'll get it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But finding something that's sustainable
is a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's a hard one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good to see that you guys are
working to try to find solutions and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just sitting back and not trying to affect
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are trying to make a
difference and trying to do the right
[SPEAKER_01]: thing by the environment and your
customers, which is which is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just going to say, like we are
we are trying our peat is sourced,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pretty local to where we mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sustainability thing, you know,
it's tough because it depends on where you
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're reading the sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears to be pretty mixed on how
sustainable peat is as a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put together a blog post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in peat versus cocoa,
I bet it'll just pop up in Google pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: high on the list or go to our blog page
and type that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a more in-depth discussion
that I have on it because there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: pros and cons to to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than we get into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's an interesting topic,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is like, too, like if we can
get people to reuse that soil and not be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding more peat to it, you know,
by managing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have some guys like Goldleaf
now, I think they're like seven or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years using the same soil that they got
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me feels pretty darn sustainable
compared to even people that are in other
[SPEAKER_00]: media types that are having to throw out
their soil every cycle and bring in new
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, you know, for the
horticulture industry, the plants have to
[SPEAKER_01]: get sold and go to somebody's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't even have those options.
[SPEAKER_01]: They constantly have to be buying media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a challenge for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting to hear everything
that is happening in that area and see how
[SPEAKER_01]: things are going to end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you mentioned, you know,
as compost basically being the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of people that listen to
your podcast are obviously very soil
[SPEAKER_01]: savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there are people that are
newbies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody wanted to just understand
what compost is and understand about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have a recommended resource for
learning about compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what type of
composting you want to do to whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal or static or worm or some
combination of the three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's such a complicated
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by a book that explains
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in full disclosure, I had to take
a semester of composting in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a book I had that went
through all the different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sorry, it was not one of my
favorite classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed one elective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that was the elective I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting because I did discover
a new species of insect in my compost
[SPEAKER_01]: pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made it exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, because I mean, I do think
and I think we're all guilty of this
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in conversations and people are
talking about a subject we may know some
[SPEAKER_01]: about, but we just sit there and nod and
shake our head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going along with we understand what
they're saying because they're embarrassed
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, hey, I don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some people still want some of
that background, basic information about
[SPEAKER_01]: soils and compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just you're talking about the
different types of composting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people probably don't know there
are multiple types of composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're working on some course
materials to put together something for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that may eventually and there are
there's books out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just none popped to mind right off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a lot of chapters and books that
are quite good on composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good information online
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a ready resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time since I've done a
lot of reading around compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am working on putting together a
botany course with Don Marshall for people
[SPEAKER_00]: who, you know, like myself that didn't go
to school for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually went back to school just to
take his botany course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to put together an online
course where people like myself could
[SPEAKER_00]: learn, you know, basic botany without
having to go back to school, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to college and and take all the
classes where it can be broken down into a
[SPEAKER_00]: more hands on practical online course that
people can take in, you know, chunks as as
[SPEAKER_00]: they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on that right now
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also a cultivation course,
too, hopefully down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also the same sort of thing like
easy tidbits of good information,
[SPEAKER_00]: all science based in sort of an online
format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we would have a section on
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just my big highlights on compost,
it's not all created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is important if you're talking
about making an organic soil mix to as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're to incorporate that as your base to
really know what you're adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to affect your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect the microbial
communities of that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to it's going to affect the
nutrient load and content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just plays such an important important
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when I go to the grocery
store and I see these like six dollar bags
[SPEAKER_00]: of compost and I look at the ingredients
or even just work backward on the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, well, the grocery store
wouldn't have paid more than like three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four dollars for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the company that made it,
if they're getting four bucks a bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to be making a profit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how much did the bag cost and
how much did the transportation cost by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time you get down it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That material had to have been free or
like pretty worthless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you're getting is not high
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I wouldn't use any of that
stuff in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just it's just another way
of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people think all compost is good and
it's it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies quite a bit.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, source material, because I live in
the land of mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's yeah, it's very different
than other compost for sure out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's exciting about the botany
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: But botany was that was a tough one in
college for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horticulture zips through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all of the Latin and anatomy of all
the plants and flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably be interested in going
back and take a refresher on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I took botany in 1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know we probably weren't even born
yet, Tad, were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm turning 44 next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, also as a resource in that
regard, Jeff Lowenfeld's books like
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaming with Nutrients is a good sort of
like basic botany book to give people an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of how plant cells work and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll shout that one out to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got a new book coming out,
Teaming with Bacteria, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be interviewing him soon on on that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to that,
too.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to hearing those,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so again, back to back to the company
and you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the future hold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any big visions of
projects coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where do you see yourself in 10
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a really good team right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really feels like a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all work together really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For for who we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think everyone's in it for
the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we talk about this and none
of us really have the ambition to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: take over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not looking to be a huge
company because the thing that we're most
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about is working with growers
and customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we have a very good handle
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can confidently say that, you know,
everyone's going to get a reply and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good technical reply to their questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as people get too big,
too fast, you lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even with a large corporation,
you lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, we just want to stay
relevant and continue to do what we do on
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale that we're at, which requires
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't you can't expect to
just keep doing the same thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain your your revenue and your your
leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we try to innovate a little bit,
you know, like we just added the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects from bio bee through
your your advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking for new products that
fit with sort of our ethos and that we,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we would be willing to use in
our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's I think that's where we're
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're potentially looking at expanding to
an east sorry, an East Coast soil district
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor that can mix our soil out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's going to be that's a longer
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, formulating a soil takes a
year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't you can't rush that process if
you want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of testing, a lot of plant
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure that if we do put
something out, it's of the same quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're putting out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, being the biggest is not
always the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think customer service and working with
growers is I love working with growers
[SPEAKER_01]: just directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm right there with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so Tad, if you didn't do soils and you
could have any job on the planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you your backup career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, very sometimes I just wish I had a
job where I didn't have to be in charge,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I could just like go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do like a very like discreet activity for
eight hours and then go home and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put it on the shelf and not have
to think about it and then go back to work
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you never stop
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never your brain never gets to shut
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's challenging sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I probably did anything
again, it'd probably be back into special
[SPEAKER_00]: education just because I really enjoyed
working with children and now that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a daughter of my own, I really like
watching her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I think the education teaching
thing is just it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's very exhausting in a very
different way, but it's so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I truly enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my mom was a special ed teacher
for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister was was a teacher, too,
until recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, I I watched my mom go to the the
the joys of what she was able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, it's a very mentally challenging
profession to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But well, I'm happy you're on the soil
side of things so that we can be friends
[SPEAKER_01]: and hang out and talk about bug stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm grateful to have you in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but with that, if you had some advice
to give people about the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you say to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought about this as I was like,
OK, what questions might you ask me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought about like what from from
all the years of doing the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've been doing, like what are
the pieces of advice that I think would be
[SPEAKER_00]: most helpful for growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote down a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just share that here if that
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that I learned and
this was probably from Don Marshall was
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what your limiting factor of
growth is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a detective when you walk into a
when you walk into a grow room or into a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or whatever that scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it may be soil,
it may be your watering, it may be your
[SPEAKER_00]: light, it may be your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really have to figure that out
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like your your big push on
you need to identify that bug before you
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same sort of mentality like
you've got to you've really got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: detective and figure that out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if people can start thinking
like that, it goes a long, long way to
[SPEAKER_00]: making like good decisions in your garden
and really just paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people really have an eye
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to really stop myself and slow down
and take a look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I have other growers that I work
with that, like they can walk into a room
[SPEAKER_00]: and instantly spot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have that skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have to like pause myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably my biggest piece of
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other things that I thought about is
like, try not to fall for marketing hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see these feeding schedules
and organics that require people to use
[SPEAKER_00]: like multiple products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are like popular companies with
popular products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like to me,
that's no better than feeding a bottle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just you're throwing away
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need all these products with
these enzymes and ferments and teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, like if that's it's
all about that limiting factor of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do get a response from
whatever you're adding, then you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and figure out why and figure out
what it is that's lacking in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it's not a
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something with your watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other things is like, read the
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like know what's going on with the product
and realize that when you read a label,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting all the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not even getting half the
information that you need on that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's important to do your
own sort of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trust manufacturers on things that
could ruin your livelihood, like heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen I've seen heavy metal tests on
reports that people put out on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've had growers send me heavy
metal tests on that same product that were
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they send it to me because they're
like, hey, we failed for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tested everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing was nowhere near what we
thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really sad because they lose
their crop on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think as a grower, you have to do
your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trust anyone when it comes to
something that could ruin your livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big fan of soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that it tells the whole
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to rely on strictly on
calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can point you in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still think you need to talk to an
actual agronomist or a person who
[SPEAKER_00]: understands a soil test and can put that
into a context that makes sense within the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow itself, because just looking at the
mineral balancing of a soil does not tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to look at the environment,
the watering, all these other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this just gives you another tool,
but it's not the full picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to do more than just a
soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have someone looking at the
soil test in relation to your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health, in relation to your bug pressure,
in relation to your environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting and CO2 levels, and then make a
fertility recommendation around all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing would be don't
fall for simplistic models of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different camps right
now, just on the organic side,
[SPEAKER_00]: like not even talking about people who are
using salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the organic side, there's
regenerative guys, there's KNF guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's soil food web guys, there's,
oh boy, I could go, biodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this huge list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people who are using the
so-and-so's grow method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, they're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to caution folks that it's
never just microbes or enzymes or
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentations or nutrient-like plants or
lighting brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those things are keys to a good
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to a good grow is getting all of
these things correct within the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say, you just need these
microbes, that's not the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking into account your
temperature, humidity, your lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just say, at the end of the
day, just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate that I think that all
of these camps, they almost feel a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cultish to a certain extent, where if
you're growing in a different method,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, especially on
the organic side, man, I feel like we
[SPEAKER_00]: should all be on the same side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all trying to do right by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all trying to grow safe cannabis,
healthy medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy how much infighting that we
have going on, because everyone wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I, we talk about this a fair
bit off air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be the pieces of advice
that I've learned over the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, how many years of doing
this, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's super helpful
information, because again, I think all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us are, like you said, are heading for the
same goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's challenging when you feel like
everybody's not moving together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, for some reason, people have to go
against each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I appreciate about
you, because you are a very calm,
[SPEAKER_01]: reasoning voice for me when I'm having
some challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will call you my industry therapist to
help me get through things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been, again, not only super
great for the industry, but as a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, I've really enjoyed being friends
with you and learning from you and looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: To being friends for many more years and
hopefully working together in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, move all in the same direction
so we can take care of this planet and
[SPEAKER_01]: leave behind a great place for your
daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very lucky to have this opportunity
with the podcast and with the business to
[SPEAKER_00]: do what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of the people we work with are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is that 1% that sometimes just
makes you just throw your hands up and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder why you're doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's any industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, are we allowed to talk about your new
poster that's coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something I can mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can throw that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, speaking of things that I'm
excited about in terms of collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with you is this poster that you're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to get my hands on it and to
be able to get it out to growers through
[SPEAKER_00]: Catchmasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to keep my business to just my
business and don't do cross marketing or
[SPEAKER_01]: branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Catchmaster people, such nice guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to do a collaboration of
making the first poster we're doing is for
[SPEAKER_01]: what insects look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like on sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they a pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they a beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it something you don't have to worry
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because looking at pests or insects
beneficial on leaves sometimes can look a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different on sticky cards because
they can change colors and reflections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'll be a poster growers can hang
up at the facilities to help them with
[SPEAKER_01]: identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've been on me for years about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it almost ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to check back because I'm not doing
any of the graphics design.
[SPEAKER_01]: I provided them all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the idea is to have it at the MJ
BizCon in Las Vegas this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I'm going to be in the bios
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning on being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll definitely have to see you there
and right in the Tesla loop, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was out there last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, I think it's going to be a
good show this year again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I think that answers a lot of
the key questions I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, people that listen to
you interview other people are curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about you and gives them a little more
insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, about you, a little bit about
your personal life, where you came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I again, I can't say it enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful for your friendship and
looking forward to learning more from you
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, here's to another another
hundred podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been too kind and way too
complimentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got a taste of what hosting
is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise we'll get back to our
regular scheduled podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already recorded two with some
awesome university professors that I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be releasing for 101 and 102.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know what's up next,
but I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess since I'm supposed to close
this out, thank you again, Tad Hussey from
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiss Organics for attending the podcast
today and answering questions for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking forward to talking to you in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Suzanne.
