[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a friendly reminder for folks who
enjoy the podcast content and want to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the podcast, we have a Patreon
where we do a book club, hangouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and share private content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also offer a wider range of products
ranging from living soils, LED lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, organic fertilizers,
and professional consulting on the Kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Julie Gresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie has 18 years of experience as a
biological scientist, practiced in
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory, greenhouse, and field
research, as well as technical service
[SPEAKER_00]: support for the integrated pest management
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been with BioWorks for five years
and has previously held positions at BASF,
[SPEAKER_00]: Becker Underwood, and Iowa State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Tad, for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt so fortunate to have met you at a
couple of trade shows now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a good friend of Suzanne
Wainwright Evans, who's also a good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine, and she speaks so highly of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited we managed to figure
out a time to get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Suzanne is a fantastic friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about everything
professionally, but also a lot of personal
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are very good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's just great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition with Suzanne, the other
good thing is we talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges that growers are having in the
field, and we bounce ideas off of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and we'll look for research together
to solve particular problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're very much a team in that
sense in trying to come up with the best
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give listeners a quick intro into
your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you came into this role at
Bioworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been with Bioworks since June of
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for about four years, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should have done the math on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little while since I looked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so right before covid and at Bioworks,
I I started off as a bio a biological
[SPEAKER_01]: program manager responsible for the our
insect management portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year we had some rearranging of
our technical services department and I
[SPEAKER_01]: switched roles to a technical services
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I am more generalist instead of
just focusing on the insect side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also help growers with the disease
management and plant nutrition to a lesser
[SPEAKER_01]: extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not where my strength
lies, but I can speak to it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But diseases and insects are where my
passion lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I so in terms of what I do as a technical
services manager, I we have a tech emails
[SPEAKER_01]: and phone calls hotline that we always
have someone on there paying attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: any calls and emails that come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I help out with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also go and visit growers in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also I work also very closely with
our regulatory marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research and development departments in
terms internally to bring new products to
[SPEAKER_01]: the market and improve on the products
that we currently have in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wear a lot of hats in that sense and
help out where I can and when I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my main my main priority is working
with the growers and helping them solve
[SPEAKER_01]: disease and arthropod issues that they're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as my history prior to Bioworks,
I was with BASF and I was in seed
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mainly did a lot of work on corn,
soybeans, wheat and cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a research greenhouse where I
treated seeds and then planted those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: into the greenhouse and then infected
those plants with soybean cyst nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or with corn rootworm to see how the seed
treatments performed on those insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was still insect focused,
even though it was in seed solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: BASF bought the company that I was working
for originally called Becker Underwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was with Becker Underwood for about
six years and with BASF for about seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Becker Underwood, I was in quality
control, regulatory, and I was also a
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode field development specialist
where I worked specifically with the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much doing the same thing that I am
doing now, but focused specifically on
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have a lot of experience working
with many of the nematode species that are
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially produced and used by growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's pretty much me in a
nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for folks that are listening,
if you are interested, you can also check
[SPEAKER_00]: out the podcast I've done with Chris Hayes
and Michael Brownbridge, who are both also
[SPEAKER_00]: at Bioworks and offer a really unique
perspective around talking about pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: and insect control and pest management,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those podcasts were recorded a while
ago, so people can check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why don't we start off talking about
nematodes since you do have a background
[SPEAKER_00]: in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I myself have only used SF nematodes
and I tend to say SF because I always
[SPEAKER_00]: mispronounce the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could start off talking a little
bit about SF nematodes and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I found them to be very
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe what other commercially
reared nematodes might a cannabis grower
[SPEAKER_00]: consider in their program?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SF stands for Steiner Nema Feltii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steiner Nema Feltii is probably one of
the most common nematodes that you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is often considered a specialist in
some fly species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is very commonly used for fungus
snap management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steiner Nema Feltii is also used for
thrips management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thrips pupae that fall pre pupae and
pupae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to note that not all
thrips pupate in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to use nematodes,
Steiner Nema Feltii or Steiner Nema
[SPEAKER_01]: carbocapsi for management of thrips,
you do need to make sure that you identify
[SPEAKER_01]: the thrips species that you have and
confirm if that thrips species is in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: pupating in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's not, you can throw all of
the beneficials in the soil that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to work because they're
pupating on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips are an interesting species in that
they are sort of an intermediate between a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete and an incomplete metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pupae still kind of have legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you poke them, they can actually
still move around, which is unlike what
[SPEAKER_01]: you would think of when you think of a
pupae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we kind of consider thrips
as an oddball in that it has this odd
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, that's why the pupa
can sometimes will stay on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, they still have legs to
grip onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few species of thrips that
do continue to pupate on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those being Echinothrips are a good
example of a thrips that would pupate on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now something like an onion or a Western
Flower Thrip, onion probably being the
[SPEAKER_01]: more common species in cannabis and hemp,
are often pupating in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a really thick, say,
flower or bud, sometimes they may get
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck in those and not come out and pupate
in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, they're going to
drop to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can use beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also a couple of other soils
that are real based beneficials,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as Stratiolalaps and Delocia,
which are predatory mite in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: Stratiolalaps and Delocia is a beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do fly at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that Delocia isn't something
that a lot of cannabis growers use because
[SPEAKER_01]: they might not want to get that in their
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, there are a
couple of beneficials that are used for
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnat management.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those being Steinonymophilti.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you that there is
research, probably the most research has
[SPEAKER_01]: been done on Steinonymophilti and
Steinonymocarpalcapsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steinonymocarpalcapsi can also be used
for management of thrips and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is research that suggests that both
of those are OK to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, we use Steinonymophilti
because we have seen really good
[SPEAKER_01]: management with that nematode species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be both of those species are
fairly robust nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, what happens is if you were
going to use nematodes for management of,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, let's say fungus gnats, really fungus
gnats or thrips, say you had onion or
[SPEAKER_01]: Western flower thrips and you have fungus
gnats, which is very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very, very common insect species
that happen almost ubiquitously across all
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were going to use
Steinonymophilti, there are a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that sell nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can come in a variety of
formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a much longer conversation that if
we want to go down that path, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, there's a number of
formulations and a number of ways that the
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes may come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they come in bags, sometimes
they come in trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in almost all cases, it's either
crumbly or more of a sugar cookie batter
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll want to keep those in the
refrigerator because those nematodes are
[SPEAKER_01]: in an infective juvenile stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them that you receive are
infective juveniles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the other life stages are going to
occur in an insect host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those infective juveniles, their only
way to survive is if they find a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very driven to find this host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't find a host,
they die because they are a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: life stage in the beneficial nematode life
cycle, where they are free living,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that they're found outside of the
host.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the other life stages of the
nematode are inside the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important to know because this
adaptation of the infective juvenile,
[SPEAKER_01]: they retain the molt from the previous
juvenile nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sort of creates this jacket on
the nematode that helps it when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the host prevent or at least
decrease the chances of quick desiccation
[SPEAKER_01]: or drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of creates this jacket of
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it may also help with
compatibility because we've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: compatibility results out there with a
number of the nematode companies will
[SPEAKER_01]: provide compatibility with tank mixes that
you can apply with the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nematodes are fairly compatible with a
number of chemistries and biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give an example of something that
you may want to tank mix with a nematode
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing an application?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more common ones, maybe in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So another pest that is commonly found in
cannabis and hemp is the rice root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rice root aphid is a tough one to
control once you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, sanitation and quarantine
are incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we don't want to necessarily go
down that rabbit hole unless we want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were, many growers use enema
pathogenic fungus for management of rice
[SPEAKER_01]: root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enema pathogenic fungus, genus species,
Bavaria bassiana, Isaria, Formosa rosa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Isaria has now been renamed,
by the way, to cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see cordyceps, it is now the new
Isaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll see it sometimes
interchangeably, but the new language is
[SPEAKER_01]: cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Isaria slash cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a number of metarysiums,
which is another enema pathogenic fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three main fungal enema
pathogens that are used by growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one of those are, I mean,
they're good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of companies that sell a
number of these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the same genus species,
but different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all pretty good at management
of various soil and foliar-based insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get back to your question,
Tad, you could tank mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you also had rice root aphid,
you could tank mix your nematodes with a,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the Bavaria metarysiums or
cordyceps species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would be targeting more,
more pests, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes those are going to work
synergistically together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, the enema pathogenic
fungus, and enema pathogenic simply means
[SPEAKER_01]: insect killing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the beneficial nematodes,
although that's the easier way to say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: technically they're entomopathogenic
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of these are insect killing fungus
and insect killing nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could tank mix these two species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get additional benefits in
management of your thrips and the fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: These enema pathogenic fungus are
typically not that specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, you know, we often have labeled
pests, but you can get additional efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: by using some of the enema pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be one obvious one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that azadirachtin is a good one to
use with your enema pathogenic fungus or
[SPEAKER_01]: the enema pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's often synergy or additive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that not all cannabis growers will
use azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insect growth regulators in general are a
good thing to pair with nematodes and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus because it will slow down or stop
the life cycle and which is incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important if you're dealing with aphids or
other arthropods that have very fast life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the fungus takes typically 24 to
48 hours to adhere to the surface of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle, to germinate, to put out the
apisorium, which is the infection body
[SPEAKER_01]: that creates the metabolites and pressure
that punches into the insect's cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that hyphae goes down into the
insect's hemicele or blood and then kills
[SPEAKER_01]: the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that process to get into the insect
typically takes 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you apply one of the
fungal-based products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any aphid that molts within that 24 to 48
hour period may not be killed because they
[SPEAKER_01]: are shedding off those spores and they
don't move around very much, aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not going to crawl around and
get more spores typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you apply initially is oftentimes
going to be what you're going to contact
[SPEAKER_01]: them with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can slow down the insect's life
cycle with an insect growth regulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will very, very commonly have higher
efficacy when targeting pests like aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips, whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to make sure, just to reiterate,
you're saying using a product like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe like Azagard or Azamax is
brands that I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's others out there on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something azadirachtin, Jackson-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at a Bavaria product,
obviously with BioWorks, you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanogard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also familiar with BioSaris is another
Bavaria product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially, people could look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then combining those two along with a
nematode and specifically SF nematodes or
[SPEAKER_00]: steinonymic carpocapsia, if I said that
somewhat close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we, one thing I wanted to touch on
with you, and we talked about this a
[SPEAKER_00]: little ahead of time, was this is
something that I learned from Suzanne that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is really important to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that these different species
are within, let me back up, within like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take Bavaria as an example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioWorks through Botanogard has a very
specific species of or strain of Bavaria
[SPEAKER_00]: bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what gets commercially
reproduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They discovered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has very unique special properties
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so successful,
because it can survive in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different media, different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be different than,
say, the product from BioSaris or another
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a different strain or
species of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Bavaria bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to the idea that not all
Bavaria is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because, and this is the same for
mycorrhizal fungi, this is the same for,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I understand, pretty much all of
these beneficial microbial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growers may want to, rather than
saying Bavaria doesn't work or Bavaria
[SPEAKER_00]: does work, they need to find a specific,
they need to try maybe a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different brands to figure out what works
in their environment, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, you know, biotic and abiotic
factors they may have in their growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their cultivation facility or space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to add to that
or touch on in regards to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have a number of things to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, I want to mention that
Botanigard is no longer sold by BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now marketed by OHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this year we are planning on
launching our own product and we hope to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that at Cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still waiting on our EPA
registration, which should be soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, so let's talk
about a few of the products that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Botanigard, which is a Bavaria
bassiana strain GHA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is BioCyrus that is ANT03 strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Velifer, which is PPR,
RI5339 strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those are the main ones,
at least those are the ones that come to
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our strain that we are going to be
commercializing is also a Bavaria
[SPEAKER_01]: bassiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these are Bavaria bassiana
species, but they're different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll say about that is oftentimes
all of these different strains have been
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated initially from an insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So researchers in the field, they see
these mycoast or fuzzy bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the mycelium and the spores
that are produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they take those mycoast insects into
the lab and they culture them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since they were on a bug in the field,
is that something that's just advantageous
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus or is that something that actually
killed the bug?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will take those spores that they
get from their culturing and try to infect
[SPEAKER_01]: other bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they kill, then it's likely that it
is an enema pathogenic fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, there are a ton out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just the ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot more that is known than
is commercialized for a number of reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly, you know, are these particular
fungal strains capable of being mass
[SPEAKER_01]: produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not all of them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, with the botanogard
being a GHA, GHA actually stands for
[SPEAKER_01]: grasshopper A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was isolated initially from
grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other ones no fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fly is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cordyceps, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Iceria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting a little off base,
but similar concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just continue on with the
Bavarias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these different Bavarias were
isolated from different insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we can see improved efficacy
on, say, the tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'd have to go and look how ANT03
was isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that was from a plant bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I haven't looked recently,
so don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can have strengths and weaknesses
from all of your fungal strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes I will tell growers that you
don't necessarily have to use just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a couple of the fungal
strains in your arsenal within the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genus species, but you could also have
within the same gene in a different genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bavaria, Iceria, cordyceps,
or Metarysium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could rotate, say, a Bavaria with a
cordyceps or a Bavaria with a Metarysium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, each one of those individual
fungal genus species and strains are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have different strengths and
weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get potentially more out of your
enema pathogens by rotating them,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is generally a good strategy to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, thanks for correcting me
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had known that about
botanogard, and I just completely spaced
[SPEAKER_00]: in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm excited that BioWorks is going to
have their own product or strain coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently have in my indoor garden,
I have the granulated Bioseris product as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as their liquid product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would suggest for growers that
the ones that you listed is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point for people in terms of
looking for commercially produced high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only say this because I know there's
some other ones out there that Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Brownbridge has tested in conjunction with
Suzanne that either, I think it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Metarysium product that had claimed names
of spores that was higher than physically
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to fit into a container,
as well as another one that had spore
[SPEAKER_00]: count so low that there was no way you
could get efficacy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you can source,
I could source Bavaria from China right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could buy it, get it shipped in and sell
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not, probably doesn't have the
same efficacy or quality that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use in our garden, as well as
potentially containing heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: other microbial contamination and other
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just caution listeners to make
sure you go with a company that's done a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of research and has a good reputation
in the industry for these specific
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to everything that Tad just
said, so the products that I've mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's the Botanigard, the Bioseris,
Velifer, Botanigard, the Lalagard M52,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Isaria or Cordyceps products,
NoFly, Isorid, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all EPA registered,
Environmental Protection Agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to get registration,
you have to have a lot of eco-ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity and to know how it's going to
behave or break down in the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and if there is any harm to say humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes through all of that testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a lot of quality testing that
goes on to make sure that quality
[SPEAKER_01]: standards are met when these fungal
products are produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of data that went behind it,
knowing that these particular genus
[SPEAKER_01]: species and strains are highly efficacious
to the pests that are labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you bring in a product from
China or from some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries that are offering these
microbes, there is no guarantee that what
[SPEAKER_01]: they say is in that container is actually
in that container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tad mentioned microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be human pathogens in those
formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come from overseas and probably
not refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as those spores die off,
it could then be a breeding ground for
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and other fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who knows what you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, as Tad mentioned, be very
cautious about bringing something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that into your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the EPA registered products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may cost you a little bit more than
the ones that you get, but you know it has
[SPEAKER_01]: valid data behind it, backing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that you will get a good
result where you don't have that with the
[SPEAKER_01]: off market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not off market, but black market microbes,
which we sometimes call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are technically black market because
they're not legally allowed to be sold in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US, but they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also mentioned about formulation,
and I think that's important to mention
[SPEAKER_01]: with the enema pathogen fungus
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's granules, there's liquids,
and there's wettable powders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three most common
formulations with probably the wettable
[SPEAKER_01]: powder typically being the most commonly
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that that's probably the
most common because, well, it's got a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of proven efficacy, but it's got really
good crop tolerance profiles too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wettable powders are very crop safe
typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that's probably the second
most common is a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be in a typically an
oil-based formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have water in your
formulation because that will make the
[SPEAKER_01]: spores germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in oil that has very low water content,
think honey basically, that honey has very
[SPEAKER_01]: low water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oils typically have very low water
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can formulate in oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those formulations are going to be
horticultural mineral oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those are going to be seed
oil-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll see that as OD,
oil dispersion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's an ES, emulsifiable
concentrate or suspension.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically those are liquid
formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are really, really good
formulations to use, especially outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have some rain fastness with
that that you typically don't with a
[SPEAKER_01]: wettable powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are strengths and weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you want to be careful by putting oil
in say the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, or the media where the roots are,
because you don't want to suffocate the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some formulations that are
labeled for drench and in which case
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that you may get
additional efficacy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that it's labeled for the
particular application that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the liquid formulations are excellent
in that in addition to the efficacy you
[SPEAKER_01]: get from the fungus, you also get
additional efficacy from typically
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a couple of different mode of
actions with the oil-based formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one that I will mention is the
granule formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had them on the market and then for
a while we didn't have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're starting to come back
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the granule-based formulations
of enema pathogenic fungus are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you are targeting insects in
the soil, indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because basically when you pot up your
media, you are incorporating these
[SPEAKER_01]: granules into the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're basically landmines in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, as insects come into the soil
profile or are moving around potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil profile, they'll encounter
these balls of spores and get infected
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you water, those spores will also
disseminate throughout the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other benefit to having a granule
formulation in the soil is, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a lot of microbes in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot now about regenerative soil
and having all those microbes in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that have a healthy soil environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all of the things that you could have
in those soils, you can also have
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially, depending on what's in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibition effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that may cause Bavaria or a
fungus to not germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, with a granule,
the granule typically has some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: food associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it is a rice grain, that rice is
no longer alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry or mill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are no longer alive,
but it's food for the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by having that food source
available in that granule, if there are
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that are now competing for
resources and space, by having that food
[SPEAKER_01]: source in the granule, you actually get
that fungus is able to then outcompete
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the other soil microbes,
at least in its general vicinity,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can get increased efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also longevity wise, if you did a
wettable powder drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are studies, there's a study by,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to think of out of Vermont,
there was a study that was done where the
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher did a drench of wettable powder
versus the granule formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got good efficacy from both,
but they found that longevity wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: the granules lasted a lot longer than the
wettable powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again- What was the target insect
in that study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I don't remember what the
target insect was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were, actually it might have
been thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tad, I can get you a copy of that
study if you're- Yeah, I think listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: might find that interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that from talking to Suzanne,
one of the things she was most excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which got me excited, was using the
granule formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I specifically, like I said,
I have the one from Bioceris, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for treating root aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't have root aphid in my garden
currently, but I am incorporating a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of the granules in at transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, root aphids are the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a precautionary preventative for
thrips, and I believe it works on fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: nets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a really easy, formulation to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that idea of increased persistence,
or also the idea that when you have a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: that has holes on the bottom, knowing that
those root aphids can reach those holes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, it's really hard to get spores
all the way down there, and good efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're doing a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is where these granules
could really shine as a formulation option
[SPEAKER_00]: for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see these companies,
and I'm gonna throw BioWorks under the bus
[SPEAKER_00]: here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see them come up with
smaller sizing, because it's so hard as a
[SPEAKER_00]: home grower, whether for my vegetable
garden, or for my indoor garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: to find products in sizing that make the
sort of sense that I can use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you, and we do get that question
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these commercial formulations,
again, because they're EPA registered,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have very strict label language
requirements, and personal protective
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, and very strict use
requirements, and reapplication intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of all of that, it can be more
challenging to sell that to the homeowner
[SPEAKER_01]: or the small grower, because they may not
have the understanding that the label is
[SPEAKER_01]: the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why oftentimes in, say,
Home Depot, you still have products like
[SPEAKER_01]: seven that you can buy off of the shelf,
that have these same active ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use in commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you look at the active
ingredient concentration, it's very often
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly less than what you would get
in these EPA registered products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sold to large operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part, I think, of why you don't
see as much of the companies supplying to
[SPEAKER_01]: homeowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with that being said, there is,
I don't know if, there are distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: that do cater to homeowners and smaller
growers, and do offer smaller pack sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: or not case quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some options out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember that if you're going to be
using a microbial or a live organism,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nematode, or a fungus, or a
bacteria, that if you're buying those off,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, Amazon or something like that,
you and the manufacturing companies don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how those products necessarily have
been stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the shelf life, has been expired,
so you may get expired product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not saying that you will,
but I'm just cautioning you that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to buy a live product,
please consider going through a
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor that is reputable in the sense
of they know how to handle, store,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ship these live organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that you get the best
possible product that will kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: arthropods or diseases that you are
targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a dead nematode, or a dead fungus,
or bacteria is not going to control your
[SPEAKER_01]: pest populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important on how it's stored and
shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's something that Suzanne's
really drilled in my head on the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now offer insects, through BioB,
but we ship everything overnight,
[SPEAKER_00]: directly from the insectory, so we never
touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know on the insect side,
some folks are repacking into smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities for homeowners, which is nice,
but that can also impact the quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of the actual product when it
arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I learned with nematodes,
and maybe you can validate this or tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wrong, but essentially, the reason
these quantities are so high with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes is there's sort of a critical
mass, kind of like a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a minimum needed to maintain the
viability that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're sold in these fairly
large quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with nematodes, there is a ton of
research out there on a plethora of
[SPEAKER_01]: arthropods, and the research that has been
conducted are using a quantity of
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes to kill said pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the rates that we're recommending
for nematodes are based on research
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say for the in vitro-produced
nematodes, or nematodes that are produced
[SPEAKER_01]: in, say, fermentation, the rates for those
types of nematodes are typically in the
[SPEAKER_01]: one billion nematodes per acre rate,
sometimes less, sometimes more,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, depending on the species of pest
that you're targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use, for an example, there is a
nematode, I would say lesser known,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still very commonly used, called
heteroarbidus bacteriofora.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a nematode that is very commonly
available and can work better on say
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good beetle nematode species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple of beetles on the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Japanese beetle, there's one that many
of us are familiar with, and those
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles, the grubs, are easier to kill
than, say, a European chaffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a Japanese beetle, we're going at
a half to one billion nematodes per acre
[SPEAKER_01]: versus a European chaffer that may go up
to four billion per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why you see differences in
rate often, again, goes back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: research in how many nematodes were
required to kill that particular pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a nematode, an infected juvenile,
you apply via spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broadcast is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dripper can work, but you have a single
point, and those nematodes then need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: out from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can still work, but you need to
provide the moisture for them to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it contacts, let's say, the Japanese
beetle grub, and really insert pests here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using beetles as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that particular pest does not
recognize that nematode as self,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you only really need a couple of
nematodes to get in to overwhelm its
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes also carry a bacteria,
and in the case of Steiner Nema,
[SPEAKER_01]: they regurgitate that bacteria,
and it's actually the bacteria that does
[SPEAKER_01]: the killing of the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It multiplies, and then the nematodes are
actually eating the bacteria that was
[SPEAKER_01]: killed by the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Heterorhabditis nematodes
actually defecate or regurgitate the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: into the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a couple of nematodes to get
in, say that Japanese beetle, to release
[SPEAKER_01]: that bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not recognize that there is an
invasion going on, and pretty soon it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through septicemia, blood poisoning,
because of the bacteria, and it dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's say the European Chaffer,
it does recognize the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I am being infected by nematodes,
and it will launch an immune response that
[SPEAKER_01]: is much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have a lot more nematodes
being applied to the soil in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelm that particular insect,
or in this case, grub immune system to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill that insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you see the difference in
rate with nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, typically with the rate being
around a billion nematodes per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously that's per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes on labels, you'll see that
more in the per thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you work that up two acre,
it's going to be in that general vicinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware that it was the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nematode, take me through that,
the nematode penetrates the grub,
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin of the grub essentially,
and then deposits the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the bacteria reproduces,
and then it re-eats the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that essentially what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is essentially what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for Steiner Neman nematodes,
they have to enter through natural body
[SPEAKER_01]: openings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the mouth, the anus,
and the sphericals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once in, they release the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shed that jacket that we talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They release the bacteria, and then the
bacteria kills the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the soup that is produced from the
death of that insect will be the food
[SPEAKER_01]: source for the nematodes to go through a
couple of generations of nematodes inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the particular host.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger the host, the more generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller the host, the fewer
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once food starts to become limited,
that next generation of nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of going into the next juvenile,
the juvenile stage will then, once the
[SPEAKER_01]: food is limited, will go into the
infective juvenile stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the stage that leaves the host
in search of more hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically the life cycle of,
general life cycle of the nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would go for both Steiner Neman as
well as Heterorhabditis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you though that
Heterorhabditis nematodes also have a hook
[SPEAKER_01]: on the end of their nose or their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for insects with very thin cuticles,
they can actually direct penetrate into,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a grub, because a grub would have a
very thin cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have direct penetration,
which may be why we see it being a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit better for, say, grubs than,
say, a Steiner Nema would be that would
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go through the mouth, the anus,
or the spiracles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's also, I mean, if you want to
get into all the different nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Steiner Nema Feltii,
we have Steiner Nema Carbocapsi,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have Heterorhabditis Bacteriophora.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other really cool thing about
nematodes is they have different foraging
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with Heterorhabditis,
they are what we call a cruiser,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are a very active nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put them into the soil and they go
crazy using up their energy until they
[SPEAKER_01]: find that host or they don't and they die,
or they continue on their life cycle in a
[SPEAKER_01]: host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're go, go, go nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have Steiner Nema Carbocapsi that
have an ambush foraging strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a nematode that has been
adapted to the surface of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you find them in the upper soil layer
and the soil surface, and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: after more of your mobile insects that are
going to be on the soil surface or in that
[SPEAKER_01]: upper layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can do this thing where they can
actually lift their bodies up off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate and they sort of wait to wave
around and if they sense a host that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming either through vibrations or
through volatile cues that are given off
[SPEAKER_01]: by the insects, and they sort of curl
themselves up into a ball and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: flick themselves at their host to improve
their success into contacting that host.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called nictation, and that's done
by our ambush nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going after a pest that is a
surface pest, you might want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pick Steiner Nema Carbocapsi,
because in addition to what I just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are also a little bit more
desiccation tolerant and sometimes also
[SPEAKER_01]: heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Sanderson from Cornell, who just
retired, did a study on these nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and found that Carbocapsi is a little bit
more heat tolerant than, say, Steiner Nema
[SPEAKER_01]: Feltii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, finally, Steiner Nema Feltii is an
intermediate nematode, so its foraging
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy is somewhere in between that of
the cruiser and the ambusher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a very large nematode,
whereas Steiner Nema Carbocapsi is a much
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can have Steiner Nema Feltii
sort of hanging out or cruising around for
[SPEAKER_01]: a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically you'll find that in the upper
soil profile, but typically much lower in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil than, say, that of Carbocapsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your Heterobditis nematodes,
with it being very active, has the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: range where you may find it throughout
that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a little bit more in potentially
in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, when you're growing in pots,
the type of media does have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more dense and compact the soil,
the harder the nematodes get through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had, say, Cocoa Choir or a
peat-based media or mixture, as many of us
[SPEAKER_01]: do, that is a really an excellent media to
use beneficial nematodes in, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the beneficial fungus that we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also a good media.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use nematodes and fungus in
say a Rockwool or Oasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the spores don't live as long and
the nematodes will often get pushed out
[SPEAKER_01]: from subsequent waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have to do more frequent
waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, more frequent applications in
that type of media than if you were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil-less based media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those types of medias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really interesting because I was
going to ask you how the heck do these
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes survive if most of their life
cycle is inside an insect?
[SPEAKER_00]: How in nature are they surviving?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any way we can apply that
knowledge to say an indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: CEA environment, where we're trying to
kill off all insect hosts and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: assume the persistence is not great in
terms of these nematodes surviving beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: the initial application very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a couple other nematode
questions since we seem to be going down
[SPEAKER_00]: the nematode and entomopathic fungi rabbit
hole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to have to have you back on,
I think, to ask you the actual bulk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that I'd originally planned for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just stick with the nematodes for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematode survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest factor, I think,
in nematode survival is to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you give them enough soil moisture in
order to not only survive, but move in
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have, say, a lot of
flushing and a lot of that water that the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequent waterings where you have a lot
of water that's coming out the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot after, you know, a nematode
application, because you could be pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: them through, especially if you have,
say, a pure coco coir.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty porous media and you could
wash them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, think about your waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you still want to water,
but not to the point of a lot of run
[SPEAKER_01]: through through the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of survival, as long as they
have moisture and you don't dry it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to search for hosts and
either find them and infect or perish
[SPEAKER_01]: because they only have as they are feeding
in the host, they are gaining the lipids
[SPEAKER_01]: or the fats that they need in order to
find a host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they only have a finite storage of
their lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that's run out, the nematode no
longer has energy to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the faster those nematodes can find
hosts, the better, which is why doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: app, you know, a broadcast application to,
you know, get those nematodes all over in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot and then down from there is
generally a better strategy than doing
[SPEAKER_01]: drip irrigation and where they get in one
spot and then they have to move out from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will, but it will take longer to get
to those, you know, outside areas of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot where a lot of the fungus nests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just that's a good application tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I answer that question or?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think application method is important to
probably touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I had to lean heavily on Suzanne
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're looking at this at a
very much larger scale, but I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, you know, there's people like
myself that are also using them in home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens or house plants or situations
where, you know, we don't, we don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode bucket like that cool product
from DRAM that's going to keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: agitated and stirred without heating it up
and killing the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I helped them develop that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Julie, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a commercial facility that's
using a lot of nematodes, absolutely check
[SPEAKER_00]: out the, the nematode bucket from DRAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very cool product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very simple, but it's actually
quite complicated because you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them in suspension evenly,
but also not allowed any extra heat to end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And may I mention that it is not just used
for nematodes, but if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation injection, you could,
you could put your enema pathogenic fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do your nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do many of your other
applications and it, there is a swirling
[SPEAKER_01]: factor, but you can also turn on air that
will, that will increase the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the oxygen in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes aren't aquatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually they do drown, especially if
you don't have agitation, they fall to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all still consuming oxygen in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they don't have oxygen, then that's
a, that's a really good way to kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, cold water holds more oxygen than
warm water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very important to keep those
solutions as cool as possible and apply
[SPEAKER_01]: them as quickly as possible so that those
solutions don't heat up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually just did a podcast
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come out before this one,
but with less over at DRAM talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved oxygen specifically,
because it is an important topic and yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature plays a huge role in dissolved
oxygen capabilities of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did, and you can correct this,
but essentially I took the nematodes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them warm up a little bit in the
room for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then added some water to a, just a water
and can, cause I just even idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two four by four beds that I use
for sort of a test garden here at my
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled up a watering can a little bit
with a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I added the nematodes,
stirred them all in, add a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: water on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure that water was just
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it might've been a little bit too
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in retrospect, I might've been able to
go a little bit colder, but I also didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to pour a bunch of cold water on my
soil knowing that I have plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, you don't want to shock
the plants with cold water either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I then applied, it took me about five
minutes to apply my nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stirring and dumping it out,
making sure to cover as much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the soil as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, so I did this last cycle in the
room and I had, I knew that the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had came in with thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, but there was some damage and
the grower who I got them from pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: warned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, by the way, I did not know,
but I gave you thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, so I released some, some road
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe some strats and then also the,
the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not see any thrips damage
throughout that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in regards to the nematodes,
how is that as just a real basic
[SPEAKER_00]: application method for home growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any, also, are there any
sprayers that we need to watch out for
[SPEAKER_00]: when we do, if we were to put it through a
sprayer rather than just the water and can
[SPEAKER_00]: method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I just threw a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably for your, for your homeowner or
small grower based application equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, probably it shouldn't be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your simple venturi type water
displacement sprayer, like a, like a hose
[SPEAKER_01]: end sprayer, that's a pretty good method
for applying beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going, you know, it's a little bit
harder to control the amount that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying in that type of system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be aware of that,
but that's a good system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the biggest thing to be aware of
with nematodes temperature, which we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about, if there are filters in the
system that the nematodes will pass
[SPEAKER_01]: through, they tend to get caught up on
filters of 50 mesh or finer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so during the nematodes, in a nematode
application, you want to remove those
[SPEAKER_01]: filters or put in a larger filter size so
that they don't get caught up and shred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also PSI pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't want to go over 300 PSI as
long as you're below 300 PSI, which
[SPEAKER_01]: typically isn't a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the nematode should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you know, in the system,
they're subjected to a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if say it's above 300, and then they
go through the nozzle and they go from
[SPEAKER_01]: very high to very low pressure,
that is detrimental to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you're below 300 PSI should
be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say the last thing is you
don't want to have like a missed nozzle on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a nozzle that's large
enough that you have, especially since
[SPEAKER_01]: we're applying it to the soil typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have a larger nozzle on
your sprayer so that those nematodes can
[SPEAKER_01]: freely pass through and get into the soil
with the moisture that you're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about a one time pass through
like an impeller pump, like a sump pump?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had like a 50 gallon garbage can
filled with water and I added the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes to that and then applied that
through a hose and sprayer with either a
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple, you know, spray gun on the
end of that hose or even just my thumb and
[SPEAKER_00]: finger over the end, like how is that as
an option?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually did a study back in my
Becker Underfoot days where I did the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between no agitation,
aeration, and basically the bilge pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an impeller that is swirling the water
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the worst option is the no
agitation because everything falls to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it takes you a while to apply that,
the nematodes are all sinking to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically your intake is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the nematodes get applied first
and very few nematodes get applied at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have a bad distribution of the
nematodes in the grow or wherever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're applying those nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the worst option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's the difference between having
agitation and not have agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the bilge pump and the aeration,
obviously aeration was better and you had
[SPEAKER_01]: a much longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nematodes stayed viable in that
solution for I think it was an eight hour
[SPEAKER_01]: period that I did the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing, I was taking samples at
the top of the solution every hour for
[SPEAKER_01]: eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the bilge pump and this was in a
five gallon bucket, it did a really great
[SPEAKER_01]: job of keeping the nematodes in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within that first four hours,
the nematodes still looked good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that bilge pump that you put into
that, in my case, it was a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, it is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bilge pump will start to heat up
the water over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the study that I did in a five
gallon bucket, the recommendation was four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get those nematodes applied
within four hours using that bilge pump,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nematodes should stay viable,
assuming that the water temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally staying cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we throw a number to quantify cool
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 60, 65 below that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you thinking in terms of
temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me, I got, oh wait, no,
it's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess around 60 degrees would be a
good, a Fahrenheit would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematodes are going to be happiest in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their ideal range is 54 to 86 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if, once you sort of, if you're
heating up that water, slowly and not say
[SPEAKER_01]: beating them over the head with the,
you know, with an impeller, it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an easy way to check on that,
which is pull the nematodes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a sample of the solution and look at
the nematodes with a hand lens or more or
[SPEAKER_01]: better a dissecting microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the nematodes are still squiggling
around, it's a pretty, pretty easy way to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell if they're viable or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not, they're basically
pencils.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a bunch of pencils,
bad things have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's what I saw with my study.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it got past that four hour mark in
the bilge pump, I also measured
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a document on this and I would
be happy to share that with you as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: showing the pictures of the nematodes and
whatnot from this test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll get that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically after that four hour mark,
the nematodes started going to pencils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our recommendation currently is
under four hours for a bilge impeller type
[SPEAKER_01]: pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes with aeration by itself,
it's sometimes depending, let's say you
[SPEAKER_01]: just have a single stone in a five gallon
bucket and that stone isn't very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them oxygen, but you're not
necessarily getting good agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the DRAM bucket, they have both
swirling motion as well as aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your particular operation,
you'll just have to do some testing of
[SPEAKER_01]: your particular setup to see if the
nematodes are surviving that application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you start to see pencils,
then start switching up, apply it faster,
[SPEAKER_01]: apply with cooler water to begin with,
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can start to troubleshoot and
figure out ways that work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like a one time pass through
an impeller if we were to use it to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should in theory be fine, but we could
test it by just taking a look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've already been talking for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we didn't even get to the,
I really wanted to talk about Epishield
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of what you're seeing in big
issues on pest management or pathogen side
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love to get you back on to talk
about those topics sometime here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we didn't even get to talk about
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think was our main goal other than
talking about nematodes and enema
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic fungus, which I think we
covered quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you wanted to have me back,
I would be happy to come back and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about some of the differences between
horticultural mineral oils versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oil based products, the 25Bs,
the difference between a 25B product and
[SPEAKER_01]: an EPA product, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Tad, I would love that if you wanted
to have me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time today and I
will reach out and talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
