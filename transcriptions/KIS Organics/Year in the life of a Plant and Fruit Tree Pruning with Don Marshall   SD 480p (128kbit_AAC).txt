[SPEAKER_06]: So yesterday, I recorded a presentation
for our local sand and soil garden club
[SPEAKER_06]: that I'm a member at of a good friend of
mine, Don Marshall, came out to speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, the quality of the
video is not that great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have the camera in a very good
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna get better at this as I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the audio is excellent and the content
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've known Don since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, he was good friends with my
parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually is the reason I went back to
school to take courses in botany was
[SPEAKER_06]: because I knew he was retiring and I
wanted to take his classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is one of the most amazing
educators I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, I'm actually working on an
online botany course with him that we hope
[SPEAKER_06]: to release soon for folks like myself and
other gardeners who want to learn this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff but don't have the time or frankly,
the inclination to go back to school to
[SPEAKER_06]: take these classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have some notes here from my
introduction that I cut off when I did
[SPEAKER_06]: this recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna do it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don is dedicated his life to teaching
students about how plants grow and
[SPEAKER_06]: bridging the gap between botany and
practical horticulture applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don is the founder of the environmental
horticultural program at Lake Washington
[SPEAKER_06]: Institute where he taught for over 40
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to teaching, Don is a
certified professional horticulturalist,
[SPEAKER_06]: eco-pro and certified arborist.
[SPEAKER_06]: He owned and operated plant designs,
a landscape design installation
[SPEAKER_06]: maintenance firm specialized in organic
fine gardening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don also co-authored Home Landscaping
Northwest Region published by Creative
[SPEAKER_06]: Homeowner now in its fourth printing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I just wanna say I know this
isn't the best angle on the recording but
[SPEAKER_06]: the audio is excellent and Don is amazing
so I hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy running around at his parents'
nursery and stuff and so it's so fun to
[SPEAKER_09]: work with him and so fun to see him doing
gardening and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even my kids are now starting to garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughter asked me if tomatoes were
coming back next year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to say, where did you grow up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say that, I just said wow,
no I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so Ted asked me to speak on fruit
tree pruning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_09]: In November?
[SPEAKER_09]: He said November?
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that's not the time to talk about,
he said well that's what they want,
[SPEAKER_09]: they wanna hear about fruit tree pruning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, is that what you really wanna
hear about is fruit tree pruning?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any pruning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, any.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make things look nicer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well to make things look nicer,
well even fruit tree pruning can do that
[SPEAKER_09]: as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I've done is I'm a teacher and
everything I do is that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought a quiz for you and so it's on
the side board right over there labeled
[SPEAKER_09]: one through six and you can take the test,
the answer's on the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I thought, okay when we're talking
fruit trees, unless you know what it is,
[SPEAKER_09]: how can you prune it?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've gotta know what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I started thinking about,
okay if we're gonna talk fruit trees,
[SPEAKER_09]: no I don't wanna talk fruit trees yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna go through the seasons,
I wanna go through a year and a half in
[SPEAKER_09]: the life of a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because unless you really understand what
is a plant and what is this organism
[SPEAKER_09]: doing, and this would take like 10 minutes
to just get you all on ground zero.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it really came home to me when my next
door neighbor, those are often the most
[SPEAKER_09]: difficult aren't they?
[SPEAKER_09]: Said to me, well you know my prune tree
has never fruited.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't fruit at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yours fruit, I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, well let's have this
conversation again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said the reason your tree is not
fruiting is because you have people come
[SPEAKER_09]: and shear them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when did they come and shear them?
[SPEAKER_09]: Two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fruit trees bloom on last year's wood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you prune all last year's wood off,
then the stupid tree won't fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the stupid tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I go through this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said you need to think about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to think about when you prune
determines when you have fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would run across this many,
many times when I was consulting,
[SPEAKER_09]: when I had my own business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my head, I never said it to
clients, but in my head I was thinking,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not thinking like a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not thinking like what is going on
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, so I thought, I try to teach
people to think critically.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna do that for you today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look on your handout,
some of the things got cut off.
[SPEAKER_09]: But go to the back page that starts with,
starts with I think when to lightly prune,
[SPEAKER_09]: hard prune, fertilize, transplant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see that at the top of one page?
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's extra handouts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are the extras?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't, I should have.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is my, I don't have any copy.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could just look on with somebody
and she'll, out of copies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you guys could share a little.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So on, on the top of that page somewhere,
write the months of the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know, this is January,
represents January, February, March,
[SPEAKER_09]: April, May, June, July, August,
September.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause what, what we're going to do is
we're going to say, all right,
[SPEAKER_09]: let's think about a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in my yard, I'm in my garden and
there's my rose bush or there's my YG or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever you want to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's really going on with you?
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's start.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the answers are down on this
column.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you could also put the months by
those also, if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to, we're going to talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so dormancy, when is dormancy?
[SPEAKER_09]: Winter, which is let's say January.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So January we're in winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to talk about an average
year, which I know with climate change,
[SPEAKER_09]: there is no average year anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year is a hundred year flood or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to basically talk about,
okay, what's, what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, January, it's dormant.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant is dormant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the plant dead?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant is still respiring, meaning it's
still carrying on growth processes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Root growth may be growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's above freezing, if it's like
40, 42 degrees in the soil, roots continue
[SPEAKER_09]: to grow, even though there's not top
growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's still interactions going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that plant is alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you know if something's alive or
dead?
[SPEAKER_09]: You scratch the bark with your fingernail,
it comes up brown, it's dead.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it comes up green, it's alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many times you looked at your
raspberries and thought, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_09]: this is alive or dead, and you scratch it
and go, whoa, it's alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have cut that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so we're dormant here.
[SPEAKER_09]: In February, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dormancy and maybe by the end of February,
things are starting to come out of
[SPEAKER_09]: dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking internally within the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not be seeing it, but internally
the plant is starving.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's starting to go through dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant is a responder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Responder to what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Day length, temperature, day temperature,
night temperature, light intensity,
[SPEAKER_09]: those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the plant's a responder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the end of January,
you know, don't you always think if I
[SPEAKER_09]: could just get through January 31st,
I'm home free?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because November and December can be so
gray and so dark.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so really the plant is feeling that
way also.
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting in February, it's getting a
little warmer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plant processes are starting to kick in
gear.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying, well, I don't see anything
growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not seeing anything growing at that
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting in about March, we start to get a
growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Buds start to swell.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see it in your plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Buds start to swell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, bulbs are blooming,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: We start to get this growth surge in March
and in April.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, in April, we get a growth surge,
don't we?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, whoa, things start to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they start to move.
[SPEAKER_09]: They start to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the new growth coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: We may get in April and in May,
we may get some flowers if it's a spring
[SPEAKER_09]: bloomer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You start to get the azaleas and the
rhodes and the early rhodes and all kinds
[SPEAKER_09]: of things starting to come in.
[SPEAKER_09]: The forsythia in February, you know,
the epimedium, the plums start to bloom
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty early.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cherries bloom early.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going on in March and in April
and in May.
[SPEAKER_09]: And possibly if it was an early spring
bloomer in May, we start to get to a
[SPEAKER_09]: little fruit set.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you may get some fruit setting after
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the fruit is very, very small,
not talking about edible, but even maple
[SPEAKER_09]: trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a red maple blooms in February.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sets its fruit in April and in May.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by June, it drops it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of your maple trees, put on fruit,
drop them off right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you may be getting fruits dropping
at this time of year as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not if you're a big leaf maple,
you hold those on for a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what's going on in June?
[SPEAKER_09]: June, you know, I love June.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like green month.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so electric green.
[SPEAKER_09]: The vine maples are so bright.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Douglas firs are so bright.
[SPEAKER_09]: All this new growth has come.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took all this time to start to grow,
break dormancy, start to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leaves are expanding.
[SPEAKER_09]: By June, the leaves are just really
expanding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, often June used to be a very rainy
month.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we would get cool temperatures.
[SPEAKER_09]: We would get rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to call it June January,
remember?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the leaves are really expanding.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's green month.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the time it hits May and June,
the plant is exhausted.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow, that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just put out a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when my food reserves are at the
lowest ebb.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when I'm hungriest.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when if I'm going to add some
nutrients, especially synthetic,
[SPEAKER_09]: but if you're adding organic, the organic
nutrients are going to be tied into the
[SPEAKER_09]: microbial activity, which as it starts to
warm up and moisture is available,
[SPEAKER_09]: it starts releasing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plant says, oh good, I am ready for some.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it will start absorbing a lot
during this time, okay, during May and in
[SPEAKER_09]: June.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have blueberries, for instance,
you know, by June, they're starting to put
[SPEAKER_09]: on fruit and the fruit's starting to
expand because in July they're going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: ripe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens in July?
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts to get hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts to get hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we start to get drought.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started to get some dry periods.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last couple years, we've had that a lot
earlier, haven't we?
[SPEAKER_09]: June's been very hot and sunny.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in average years, you know,
in average years, July 4th holiday is
[SPEAKER_09]: ruined by the rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then July 5th, it turns nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're back to work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great holiday in the rain in the tent,
but you know, you're now back to work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant starts to go through a little
bit of beginning of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_09]: drought stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: By August, we're in drought stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: By August, we've, you know, the end of
July can be very sunny, very bright,
[SPEAKER_09]: very hot, not a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant is starting to experience
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: August, it can be drought stressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen some years it's been so hot
that in August some plants kind of give up
[SPEAKER_09]: and just say, I'm going to lose,
we're done.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't support you anymore, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they've dropped, some plants drop
leaves in August.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the end of August, there's all kinds of
hormonal changes going on in the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plant is saying, prepare for
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Daylight is shrinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Woop, woop, woop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Downstream.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't even see it, but by the end
of August, the plant is now going,
[SPEAKER_09]: okay, day length is shorter.
[SPEAKER_09]: We might even put in a few blossoms
because as you look at, you look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: distance from June, out here and here some
spring bloomers put on a secondary bloom.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not global warming or the sky is
falling.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get these things.
[SPEAKER_09]: My, my dogwood's blooming and it's
September.
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew the world was screwed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, well, no, actually they do put
on a secondary bloom and so do roadies and
[SPEAKER_09]: so do a lot of things out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The world is still screwed up,
but it's not impacting your plants that
[SPEAKER_09]: way, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You still get some blooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by September, the plant is big into
start migrating all of your nutrients and
[SPEAKER_09]: sugars and calcium magnesium back to the
plant because it's now very aware that
[SPEAKER_09]: it's going to start losing its leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plant doesn't suddenly lose its
leaves and go, Whoa, what was that about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I've lost all these leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put all that energy into them and now
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It migrates everything so that we know
October, which is what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Leaf color month.
[SPEAKER_09]: October's like leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the time you're seeing leaves,
most of those nutrients have migrated from
[SPEAKER_09]: the leaves to the petiole into the stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even scale insects are going, Ooh,
I think osmotic pressure is changing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody don't move.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to the main stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: This leaf is dropping and we're going with
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those scales can migrate back to
the stem because they know those leaves
[SPEAKER_09]: are going to drop and they don't want to
be on a sunken ship.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by the time those leaves drop,
that leaf is just a carbon vessel.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to add carbon to the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be food for microbial
activity, but it's not like, gee,
[SPEAKER_09]: we put all that energy into that leaf and
now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very planned.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a very logical thing that's
going on here in response to what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Day length, temperatures, hormones inside
the plant and outside the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: November is what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wind month, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wind and rain and cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have some beautiful leaves like
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: What a great day yesterday was,
but it's still leaves are dropping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got rid of some of my leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I went out this morning,
it's all over again.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's leaves all over my walkway.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I thought I just got rid of
those.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and then what happens in December?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're back into dormancy, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is the year in the life of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Knowing that, knowing the year in the life
of plant can help you make decisions on
[SPEAKER_09]: your fruit trees, on your raspberries,
on whatever, on whatever you're pruning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if I'm going to, okay,
here's an example.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I have a laurel hedge that's 30 by 30,
it's gotten way too big and I want to do
[SPEAKER_09]: some drastic pruning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to take it out, but it's just
gotten way too big and I'm going to cut it
[SPEAKER_09]: down to stumps.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've done some research and I know
that I can do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take a laurel down to wood and it
will sprout from there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when should I do this?
[SPEAKER_09]: When is the best time to cut my laurel
hedge based on the year in the life of a
[SPEAKER_09]: plant?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can anyone venture?
[SPEAKER_09]: When would be good?
[SPEAKER_09]: December, January, January, February.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys are right on in terms of your
processing of this information.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to want to do it during
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right before growth surge, February,
March, right before your growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because by removing all that stuff,
the plant has all this stored food,
[SPEAKER_09]: which it's going to use to rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've taken off two thirds of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: That means this extensive root system,
which has a lot of stored food in it,
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to go, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to come right back.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to go right back.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could conceivably by July have
enough growth where you're actually
[SPEAKER_09]: cutting some of it back and redirecting
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had a neighbor, my old house,
I'm always thinking of neighbors because
[SPEAKER_09]: they make sins, mistakes, I don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, I had a neighbor who pruned a
laurel hedge just like that and he pruned
[SPEAKER_09]: it in October.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were taking a walk and I said,
oh, great.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be looking at those stumps for the
next year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know those stumps didn't come
back.
[SPEAKER_09]: It ended up those stumps died down,
ended up sending shoots.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, laurel is pretty hardy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sending shoots from the base.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe one of them sprouted, but an awful
lot of them died down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus they were looking at it, October,
November, December, January, February,
[SPEAKER_09]: March.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time you look at it, you go,
what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_09]: What were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_09]: What were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's because they didn't understand
the year of a life of a plant really when
[SPEAKER_09]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's talk another example.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about fertilizing?
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm going to fertilize my blueberries
or my strawberries, you start hearing on
[SPEAKER_09]: the radio in February, oh, time to
fertilize, time to fertilize, get your
[SPEAKER_09]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you throw all this fertilizer out in
February, especially if it's synthetic
[SPEAKER_09]: because synthetic is just going to be very
movable with the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still raining.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant doesn't need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant doesn't want it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant uses all its energy and its
growth surge with stored food.
[SPEAKER_09]: When does the plant need it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right after its growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right after its growth surge when it's
like, that was a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh good, look what's here.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just put some composted chicken
manure on here and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: nitrogen on here and I can use that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, you're asking yourself when to
do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's take another example.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a client once who said, this small
hedge outside my office, I was maintaining
[SPEAKER_09]: his office commercially every week.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there and he said, can you cut this
hedge back?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a secondary walkway.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a private walkway for him going to
his office.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't like a main walkway where there
were customers coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I said, well, and this was like
May.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, yeah, I can do that right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was April.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, I could do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I said, in two months, you're going to
have to pay me to do it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I don't want to pay you to do it
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, well, right now, the plant is
going through a growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I prune that right now, it's going
to respond by going, and then you're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be unhappy again in a couple months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, well, what do you suggest?
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, can we wait till July 1st?
[SPEAKER_09]: July 1st, the plant has grown through its
growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any pruning you do in July, guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: It stays there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any pruning of that hedge you do in April
and it goes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, wait, I just pruned you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I just paid to have you pruned.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I got to pay again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, thinking about, OK,
if I'm going to pay somebody once a year
[SPEAKER_09]: to prune my hedge, then I'm going to do it
after its growth surge when it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: When it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I actually was taught,
I grew up in New England, and I was taught
[SPEAKER_09]: as a kid, you don't prune things in the
fall because then they sprout new growth
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it gets frozen off.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all folklore.
[SPEAKER_09]: The plant doesn't suddenly undo nighttime
temperature, day length, all this other
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff, and go, oh, let's start to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you really want to think about,
all right, so what am I trying to do with
[SPEAKER_09]: those plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of brings us back to fruit
trees and where I started.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first thing on any plant in your
landscape that you're going to want to do
[SPEAKER_09]: before you prune it is you're going to
want to say, what's my objective here?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if my objective is flowers or fruit,
which it usually is on a fruit tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we grow fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want the apples.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I want the plums.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not because the flowers are pretty,
which they are pretty, but on the other
[SPEAKER_09]: hand, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to ask yourself, on what wood
does it fruit?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it fruits on spurs, and a spur is a
short and compressed stem, it's a little
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it fruits on spurs, then it has to take
a couple of years, a year or two,
[SPEAKER_09]: certainly by year two, to produce the
spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you go in there and you do all this
pruning, and then the stupid tree doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what you did to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the time of year that you pruned it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, peach, on the other hand,
blooms on second year wood, but only
[SPEAKER_09]: second year wood.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you do a lot of heavy pruning on
peaches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's going to put out new growth,
and that's going to fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just depends on what type of wood
the tree fruits on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions on the year and life of a
plant?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is helpful, because next time
when you prune, you can think,
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, what's going on with this plant here?
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do I want it to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: And some plants are different.
[SPEAKER_09]: Roses, for instance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do we keep pruning roses?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we want lots of flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they do grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: They bloom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut it back.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: They bloom.
[SPEAKER_09]: They cut it back.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do a lot of cutting.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when do you do your extensive pruning
on roses?
[SPEAKER_09]: March, after we've had some hard freezes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ted?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk about your fertilizing
strategy for your property, like how you
[SPEAKER_07]: manage your fertility?
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so fertilizing strategy for me,
the question was, how do I manage
[SPEAKER_09]: fertilizing strategy?
[SPEAKER_09]: My desire is to not fertilize once
established.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to put that in our head.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even drought-tolerant plants are not
drought-tolerant the first couple years.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to go through a couple winters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because remember, plants, that's why this
is such a great time of year to plant,
[SPEAKER_09]: because plants are going to continue to
establish.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a son-in-law who's putting in new
grass seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, you got till October 15 to get
that grass seed in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, why?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, because October 15 gives you
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have our first frost in November,
which we've already had our first frost.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it will grow all winter long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And grass that you plant in October,
you'll be playing on in June.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grass that you plant in April,
May, you'll be playing on the following
[SPEAKER_09]: April or May.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why it's important.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a really bird walk, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: My fertilizing strategy in my yard is once
things are established, I don't fertilize
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't rake off leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: I add a lot of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: I use chips as mulch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm trying to improve soil
structure in my gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do fertilize with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do restore nutrients in my vegetable
garden, in my berry patches, my apples.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do some, very little, because they're
established trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I test soil once a year, see what's
going on, where there's deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then add nutrients to the vegetable
garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what we're doing in a vegetable
garden is really we're taking off,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're taking off, we're taking off.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just say, well, the leaves will
take care of it, or the grass clippings
[SPEAKER_09]: will take care of it, or the organic
matter will take care of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're adding nutrients to round them out
and get better production.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my goal for my vegetable garden is
production, not because I want to weed my
[SPEAKER_09]: vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: When do you apply them to your vegetable
garden?
[SPEAKER_09]: So when do I apply to my vegetable garden?
[SPEAKER_09]: So the really thing you want to think
about is two major categories,
[SPEAKER_09]: synthetic fertilizers and organic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Organic fertilizers, much of what's in an
organic fertilizer is tied up in microbial
[SPEAKER_09]: activity in your soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Microbial activity is tied up in what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water availability, oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, good soil structure improves
microbial activity, which is going to
[SPEAKER_09]: help.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the funny thing about this microbial
activity is that they're most active
[SPEAKER_09]: during the active growing season.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when are the plants in need?
[SPEAKER_09]: During the active growing season.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas if you put on a bag of triple 16
and you put it on now, plants don't really
[SPEAKER_09]: need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The nitrates will make them green up,
but most of it's going to be washed down
[SPEAKER_09]: through the ground profile, through the
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that where you're going with that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so for your vegetable garden,
do you wait until April?
[SPEAKER_08]: To test?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, to start applying your... Right,
I start applying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, I do a lot of planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do some early planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I've done garlics and stuff
already.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do the bulk of the planting in
April.
[SPEAKER_09]: So probably right around April is when...
I've done my testing earlier and I've
[SPEAKER_09]: gotten my nutrients from you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I apply them probably April,
working them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not a big till person.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not tilling them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just working them in and scratching
them in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
Any other questions?
Yes.
Now, do you ever use Osmocote?
[SPEAKER_09]: I do use Osmocote in container plants,
like fuchsias that are in a basket,
[SPEAKER_09]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually a container that I really want a
lot of color in or something like that,
[SPEAKER_09]: I may use Osmocote in something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's really... I don't use it in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't use it in ornamental plantings per
se.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I use it in fuchsias.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some of those are pretty heavy
feeders and it's a little 12 inch
[SPEAKER_09]: container.
[SPEAKER_09]: Needs a lot of nutrients.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so let's talk about pruning in
general and we'll keep tying it back to
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pruning in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's... Let me talk about this for
one more second.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this year was a good year for
fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had good fruit this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, not so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year was horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a terrible month of March where we
had a lot of things blooming and the bees
[SPEAKER_09]: just said, that's too cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had a lot of fruit that never got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of flowers that never got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_09]: So last year was a terrible year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, there's pockets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, some of my fruit trees,
I have 50 fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the fruit trees did produce
fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was light and it was always the later
blooming apples that did produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: The early blooming apples, the plums,
the cherries, some of the pears.
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: On some trees there was nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was because of the climate,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That was because of what was going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a year about 10 years ago where
we had a very, very bad fruit year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was living on the east side,
had a horrible, horrible fruit year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kept thinking, why?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had such a great spring.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a great spring.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bees were out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was warm and it was sunny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I went back and looked at my notes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had had a very hard freeze in November.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when the leaves were like this,
even before this, when the leaves were
[SPEAKER_09]: turning yellow and stuff, we had a killing
frost and we had snow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it lasted about a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you thought, oh no, winter is going to
be horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turned out winter wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was interrupting this reclamation
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: That totally impacted the following
spring's produce.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that interesting when you think
about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so weather, climate, temperatures are
so impactful on a fruit tree, particularly
[SPEAKER_09]: on a fruit tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, it's kind of a side note.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so this is an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know, I'm going to try to follow my
notes here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that many plants have an apical
bud, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a terminal bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this terminal bud has hormones in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these hormones control all the growth
down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This hormone in here says, hey,
I'm in charge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody goes out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got me?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so these guys grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And eventually, when they get farther
away, their impact on the lower lateral
[SPEAKER_09]: buds is lessened and lessened to the point
where they produce these little shoots.
[SPEAKER_09]: By removing this terminal bud,
what do you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: You remove that hormone that's in that
bud, and the branch sprouts, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, take a fuchsia.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, I want it to bush out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You pinch it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes poof.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all those little branches have
terminal buds as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it controls that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they're controlling their own side
branch and their own side branch,
[SPEAKER_09]: their own side branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we know we've got a terminal
bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got lateral buds in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have nodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The node is where the bud meets the stem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've got the inner node, which is the
distance between nodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so this is an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm going to bounce around a
little.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope this is OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most apples produce fruit on spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, and you're comfortable with that word,
spur.
[SPEAKER_09]: And cherries produce on spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plums produce on spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pears produce on spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the biggest frustrating thing that
people don't understand is that apples
[SPEAKER_09]: produce fruit on spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you get a spur to produce?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how do you get it to create spurs?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, plants have a growth surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is my apple branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because you can't see it from where
you're sitting, here's a terminal bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's side buds, side buds, side buds,
side buds, side buds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then as you go down the stem, you see a
group of concentric circles right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't see it, but I can see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I go from tip to this little
concentric.
[SPEAKER_09]: This little concentric is called bud scale
scars.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the bud scale scar,
or scars.
[SPEAKER_09]: The terminal bud, keep in mind the
terminal bud is what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Enclosed in bud scales.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the spring, the bud scales all drop
off, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the terminal starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is last year's growth where the bud
scale scars were, where the terminal bud
[SPEAKER_09]: scale scars were.
[SPEAKER_09]: So from here to here is how much it grew
last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So from here to here is how much it grew
last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now notice this branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys in the back see that against
the whiteboard maybe?
[SPEAKER_09]: Notice on this branch, we're starting to
get these little spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spurs, really keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is a spur?
[SPEAKER_09]: A short and compressed stem, meaning it
took a stem that's growing and someone
[SPEAKER_09]: went, it looks like someone squashed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have very close nodes,
inner nodes, nodes, inner nodes,
[SPEAKER_09]: nodes, inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spurs are built scientifically to hold
weight, like an apple, an apple's heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, if you put an apple here,
it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why these spurs are built
tougher, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: So terminal to bud scale scars.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I tip this, I go in the spring and I
go, oh yeah, I don't know how to prune my
[SPEAKER_09]: apples, but I love my new shears that I
got.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think tip, tip, tip, tip,
tip, tip, tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tip, tip, tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we tip that whole plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: How does the plant respond if we tip that?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, is it going to grow spurs?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to grow like that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it stops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so if I leave it untipped,
if I leave it untipped, the farther away
[SPEAKER_09]: this apical meristem, now it's starting to
grow in the spring.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, hey, guys, we can grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_09]: You start to get spur growth right here,
spur growth right here, spur growth right
[SPEAKER_09]: here, spur growth right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once a spur, always a spur.
[SPEAKER_09]: A spur is anatomically different than a
branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your goal with your fruit trees is to
produce spurs, because if you produce
[SPEAKER_09]: spurs, you're producing fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once a spur, always a spur.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, you're saying, yeah,
but then you've got this branch,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's going to be kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if this gets heavily weighted with
fruit, it's going to start bending down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the next year I can go back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Say I haven't tipped, just like the one in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not tipped this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here it is, March, April, May.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let this thing grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: These things will start to produce spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I keep letting this grow, I'll get
spurs on here, but then I can go back and
[SPEAKER_09]: I can actually cut it to here to firm up,
to toughen up this wood, to make this wood
[SPEAKER_09]: thicker, to be able to handle the weight
of the fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how's the plant going to respond?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's going to grow some here,
grow some here.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are going to spurs on here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spurs grow, you know what spurs grow?
[SPEAKER_09]: They grow more spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you end up with a spur network in this
whole area.
[SPEAKER_09]: This will eventually, over time,
seven years, 10 years, you'll start to
[SPEAKER_09]: have spurs on all of these.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you'll end up with quite a bit of
spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then you're going to get fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you walk away with nothing else,
walk away with tipping discourages,
[SPEAKER_09]: spur production.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never read that in a book, and I was
that classic organic gardener in his 20s,
[SPEAKER_09]: got his five acres, put in a ton of fruit
trees, did the thinning, read the book,
[SPEAKER_09]: degree in horticulture, the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then right before I went in,
I thought, oh, tip, tip, tip, tip,
[SPEAKER_09]: tip, tip, tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that feels better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tip, tip.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've tipped everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid plants never produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, I'm in the industry,
and I can't get my fruit trees to fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't I get?
[SPEAKER_09]: I read books.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the books look like my trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, this is really clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You stand there with your shears,
you know, I have no idea what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You read the book, I have no idea what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I learned through self-examination
was tipping discourages, spur production.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so life changing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tipping discourages, spur production.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I leave it untipped, I keep getting
more spurs and more spurs and more spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if I did tip this back, say I tipped
it all the way back and I got a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: growth here and here, well, then I can now
go back and I can remove the lower stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: let this guy grow, let him grow some spurs
up here, and then I'll tip them again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because your goal is always to raise the
head of the fruit tree, the apple tree,
[SPEAKER_09]: so they're not going like this,
which they do because the weight of the
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And initially, you may end up doing some
fruit thinning.
[SPEAKER_09]: As painful as fruit thinning is,
it's very rewarding because you're like,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, at least I'm going to get a lot of
fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did so much fruit thinning this year and
still had way too much fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so with fruit trees, if they produce
fruit on spurs, tipping discourages spur
[SPEAKER_09]: production.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_09]: The cause of those branches that go
vertical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Water sprouts and suckers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so a sucker comes from below the
graft, on the ground, from the root
[SPEAKER_09]: system, that's a sucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: A water sprout is a vertical branch
growing like that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It just comes straight up and they're like
this and you're like, man, that's not
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were called water sprouts because the
turn of the century, the last century,
[SPEAKER_09]: they thought they were hooked into the
water system of the plant and that's why
[SPEAKER_09]: they grew so fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my theory on dealing with water sprouts
and has worked, and this ties in with your
[SPEAKER_09]: year in the life of a plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got this horizontal branch and it
goes like this every year and you prune it
[SPEAKER_09]: every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when do you prune it?
[SPEAKER_09]: February.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you prune it in February?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can see branching structure.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why that's a great time of year to
plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see all the branching structure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you take this water sprout and you cut
them all off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Plant says, ha, great, and does it again,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I would do is I would take it,
all these water sprouts, and in February,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd cut them all off.
[SPEAKER_09]: It responds, doing it all over again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in July of that same year,
I go back and cut them all off again.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're thin, they're like pencils or
thick marker pens.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can be pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut them off again.
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the plant going to respond?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not putting on anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: From then on in, you will be on an every
July cycle for your water sprouts.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that July cycle will start to reduce
the number of water sprouts every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that when you're on a February
cycle of water sprouts, it just feels like
[SPEAKER_09]: it's getting worse every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just produce more and more and more
and more and you're like, stupid tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just responding.
[SPEAKER_09]: So get them done in February, March,
and then do them again when it's hot,
[SPEAKER_09]: July, August.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're cutting them all the way back
to, good question, look on your trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always look on your trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the trunk and picture the trunk
being sideways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the trunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down and you have this,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you picture that on a tree?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the same thing whether it's a
water sprout or whether it's a branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is called the branch collar,
this section right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a switching zone, a switching zone
from where the xylem and the phloem go
[SPEAKER_09]: this way and the xylem and phloem go up
this way along the side of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you get this swollen area right
here, area right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within this collar are hormones that help
the plant seal it off and start to wall
[SPEAKER_09]: off infection.
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, say this is a heavy branch,
my first cut would be here, my second cut
[SPEAKER_09]: would be here to take off the weight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the thing is done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now while I'm dealing with a little stub,
my next cut is gonna be here, just
[SPEAKER_09]: slightly, just to go through the bark
right here, use a different color.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's gonna be right here and then the
rest is gonna be right here like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm leaving on, had clients say,
you're leaving on all these stubs.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not leaving on stubs, I'm leaving
on branch collars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Branch collars contain chemical compounds
that will wall off from infection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what is fungus?
[SPEAKER_09]: Fungus uses all of this wood as sugar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if I were to cut it straight,
make a flesh cut straight down my tree and
[SPEAKER_09]: go in here, look at what goes on now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh crap, I'm past the branch, but I'm into
the main trunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have done a major wound to that plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's gonna happen is fungus is gonna
attack right in here and start to get into
[SPEAKER_09]: this wood and in this wood.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's a soft bark plant like an
alder or a cottonwood or a willow or even
[SPEAKER_09]: maples, then you're gonna get some rot in
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But by leaving the branch collar on,
and your point was, how flush do you cut
[SPEAKER_09]: those?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're cutting to collars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because really on all these little
branches right here, they all,
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll look at them, they all have
collars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even all these water sprouts have a little
bit of swollen area and then they go up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have collars too.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that if you cut to here,
well, there's buds here and instead of one
[SPEAKER_09]: cut, you'll have four next year times ten.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you got 40 cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it just exponentially starts to
increase.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the collar is a real important thing to
start looking on your tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spruce is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spruce, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a spruce.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've done a spruce and it looks
like this and you're like, you've left
[SPEAKER_09]: that eight inch stub on that tree?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the collar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I've left that eight inch stub on the
tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: No paint, no tree heel, no pruning aid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it's still on the market,
they've been shown scientifically that
[SPEAKER_09]: they trap in more moisture in organisms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let it go by itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trees bleed, don't they, in June?
[SPEAKER_09]: Maples bleed in June.
[SPEAKER_09]: If the bleeding disturbs you, then do it
in July or do it in March when they're not
[SPEAKER_09]: bleeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there is no scientific evidence that
this bleeding, which is literally water,
[SPEAKER_09]: most of it, but sweet water, if you ever
tasted it, is a problem to the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Twice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't ask you when you did it,
because anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at mine yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a beautiful lacy leaf maple that
the former owners took a chainsaw to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I either decided I was going to rip
it out because it was so horrible what
[SPEAKER_09]: they did.
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife said, no, why don't you just,
let's work with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's still a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I looked at it yesterday and thought,
you know, all the leaves are off now.
[SPEAKER_09]: From now on, I could do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I literally was combing out dead leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no foliage on it now anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I could do it now, or I could do it in
January or February.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as it's not freezing, you can do
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do it twice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do it in dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I see the branching structure,
and I can see what I want, and what is
[SPEAKER_09]: crossing is OK, what crossing is not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll do it again in July.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do it in July because, especially
lacy leaf maples turn into big mop heads.
[SPEAKER_09]: They turn into mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, what a blob.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I uplight mine at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you uplight it, you can't even
see it, because it's just like purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a blob.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a gum drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I do is in July, I go through and
I window it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I take out branches so I can see the
trunk and see the branching structure and
[SPEAKER_09]: see the uplight that I have on it at
night.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it actually gives me some texture.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I prune twice.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, I prune them in dormancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I prune in July after the growth
surge.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're talking about lacy leaf
maples, what on mine, the branches on the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, that are dying, what's causing it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Branches on the end of this Japanese maple
are dying.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's causing it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Often, Japanese maples kill parts of it
because there's so much shade.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you might have little twigs,
little branches that are dying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, usually at the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: The color of the wood is different,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a light brown.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go through and just forget even
using your shears.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just break them off with your
fingers and do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Japanese maples, lacy leaf maples,
are susceptible to crowding themselves out
[SPEAKER_09]: and shade.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, another reason to prune in July,
because you're trying to let light in,
[SPEAKER_09]: let light in, let light in.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll get less dieback.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do get verticillium, which is a
fungal disease, which is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will take out a major branch or a
major branch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have that, it's probably going
to kill the tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trees can live with it, but they become
pretty unsightly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you'll probably have to take it
out, take out some of the soil,
[SPEAKER_09]: and put in something that's resistant to
verticillium, which there are,
[SPEAKER_09]: which would not be a Japanese maple.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just depends on what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go back to pruning general and
pruning trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know there's two types of cuts in the
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is a great one I brought in.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a heading cut where, if I were to
tip this, this would be a heading cut,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I would tip it and it would respond by
going, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a heading cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: A thinning cut is where I have a branch
and I take this entire branch back to the
[SPEAKER_09]: point of origin.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I do thinning cuts, it invigorates the
rest of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I do heading cuts, I get a growth surge
right from where I cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what should be your goal with fruit
trees and many other trees in your
[SPEAKER_09]: landscape?
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be the words, light and air.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep that mantra in your head,
light and air, light and air, light and
[SPEAKER_09]: air, meaning you are doing most of your
cuts will be thinning cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of your cuts will be thinning where
you'll take the branch back to the point
[SPEAKER_09]: of origin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically what type of evergreen?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Douglas fir?
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are going to be thinning cuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge Douglas firs, you would be taking the
branch back to the point of origin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Say you wanted to make it less prone to-
Just thin it and lower a bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lowering a bit, you have to be careful in
topping a tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lowering a bit is okay if it's a young
tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a big old tree and we lowered it,
it's 100 feet tall and we lowered it by 30
[SPEAKER_09]: feet, that'd be topping, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And topping, let's talk topping for a
second.
[SPEAKER_09]: Topping is a detrimental practice to the
tree because when you've got a tree that's
[SPEAKER_09]: 100 feet tall, you've got this big old
tree and this big old tree stores a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: food in its root system.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of food in its root system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has an apical meristem and it's
growing all this way.
[SPEAKER_09]: By cutting the tree right here,
number one, it doesn't have any branch
[SPEAKER_09]: collar to heal over.
[SPEAKER_09]: And number two, the roots starve because
of lack of nutrients because all these
[SPEAKER_09]: leaves, you've taken off a third of the
plant and all these leaves can't feed the
[SPEAKER_09]: root system, so you start to get root
death.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you start to get fungal growth in the
roots, so the tree becomes unstable.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I often tell people if the tree is a
problem tree to you, then take it out and
[SPEAKER_09]: put in something that's not as much of a
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not a Douglas fir, it's just
another conifer, another evergreen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, like a hanoki cypress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a hanoki cypress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can... Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it gets too tall, sometimes we can
teach you out of a book all this stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: about why to not top a tree like a hanoki
cypress next to your house and then you
[SPEAKER_09]: say, but it gets in the gutter and it's
really annoying and I need to lower it or
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to open it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can drop crotchet, drop crotch is
where you basically, if there's a branch
[SPEAKER_09]: coming out here and a branch coming out
here, you can take it to this branch right
[SPEAKER_09]: here and let this one take over.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also reduce this one a little bit
and reduce that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get a big old tree that,
big old shrub, which is turning into a
[SPEAKER_09]: tree because it's up to your gutters and
stuff like that, you can remove branches
[SPEAKER_09]: back to their origin.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can remove the top back to a branch,
a strong branch that's going out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you want to avoid doing... Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you want to avoid doing is shearing
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to have somebody reduce it so
that when they're done with it,
[SPEAKER_09]: you go, wow, that just looks a little
smaller instead of, whoa, you really
[SPEAKER_09]: pruned that, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two different reactions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no reason why you can't take
that conifer back, have someone take it
[SPEAKER_09]: down.
[SPEAKER_09]: The root is?
[SPEAKER_09]: Might be time for a stump grinder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be time for a tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that, you know, we really have no
options.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your options are to, I mean, you have
several options, but it's just a matter of
[SPEAKER_09]: what do I want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can thin it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can lower it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want it to look nice for you still.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so get someone who's trained someone
who maybe a certified arborist,
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody who knows what they're doing,
as opposed to someone who's the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: My neighborhood is full of people that are
the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I look around and I go, wow,
they've just pruned all their heaths.
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny, they're going to bloom in the fall
and in the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've just sheared everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or what they did to my next door neighbor.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was done by a service.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they lollipopped all of her fruit
trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she does it every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you got to get people who know
what they're doing and who are
[SPEAKER_09]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay a little more for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going to have you're going to
be happier because there's no reason why
[SPEAKER_09]: that tree that you're talking to the
corner could probably still look really
[SPEAKER_09]: nice with someone knowing what they're
doing and how to prune it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could reduce it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've reduced plants easily in half and
have them still.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, you can reduce it
significantly so that it still would look
[SPEAKER_09]: good.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions at all?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting late.
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I OK?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we OK?
[SPEAKER_09]: Time wise?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm guessing people probably have
questions about rhododendrons.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's a popular plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me end with a couple things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can go from question to
question to question.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that's on here,
before I get into this one, is right
[SPEAKER_09]: plant, right place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that the truth?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to think about, OK, before I buy
something, before I plant something,
[SPEAKER_09]: how big is this going to get?
[SPEAKER_09]: How big is this going to get?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's its maturity going to be?
[SPEAKER_09]: And can I handle that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Ted said I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I really had a good time writing
page 15.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it shows that in your mind's eye,
you have this garden in your mind of what
[SPEAKER_09]: you want it to look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we plant it, it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just did a new garden installation
in my yard, in my own garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought, wow, it looks so bare.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait for five years because it
needs to grow in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, my daughter, on the other hand,
living in Woodinville, I went to her house
[SPEAKER_09]: a couple weeks ago for dinner.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's got into plants all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, they were so close together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, well, you know, these are really
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said, I know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm planning on moving every other plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love your garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the colors, all the textures,
everything was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: In three years, she's going to have to be
moving every other plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: She said, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought, well, you know, she's 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do that, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: At my age, I'm thinking, oh, I don't want
to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at mine and just think,
oh, I hope I live long enough to see this
[SPEAKER_09]: thing fill in, you know, that kind of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, so right plant, right place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This, I brought this in specifically.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a pear tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, what do you notice?
[SPEAKER_09]: Lichens, mosses, lots of spurs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: So lots of spurs, lichens, and mosses.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of you have lichens and mosses on
your fruit trees?
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm here to make you unhappy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lichens and mosses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is my observation, my theory,
my conclusion.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've listened to a lot of professionals on
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is some things that lichens and
mosses actually leach nutrients into the
[SPEAKER_09]: soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some beneficials there,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my observation is notice is that when
you see lichens and mosses, first of all,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you go to the whole rainforest,
lichens and mosses are why?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're there because of environmental.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're there because of rain,
because of shade, because of darkness.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we get a lot of moss simply due to
exposure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what do you do when you have a fruit
tree?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a fruit tree that's in full sun,
hot, blazing sun, and it's covered with
[SPEAKER_09]: lichens and mosses.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't say, well, we live in the
Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's true, but it's in full sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why do we have lichens and mosses?
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, look on your fruit trees and see if
you have a lot of cracking on your
[SPEAKER_09]: branches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, this is a thick branch, and you've
got this cracking going this way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I studied under a professor, and we were
talking about cracking of trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, I have cracking on my trees.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said root stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Root stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Root stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: Root stress that may have happened years
ago when it was transplanted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they didn't spread the roots out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they kept it in the pot and then put
the pot in the ground and didn't score the
[SPEAKER_09]: root ball.
[SPEAKER_09]: That may 20 years later be causing stress
because the roots are actually kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: girdling each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my theory on this is lichens and
mosses are a sign of stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a sign of stress of the tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be that root stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be soil compaction.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be, I took out a tree yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took this tree out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the problems was, and I did
this, is that I mounded, don't you hate
[SPEAKER_09]: when that happens?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's like, I can't get it off,
I can't get it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I did on this tree, I hadn't
thought about what I did on this tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does look pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it didn't produce fruit at all this
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what it did, I put on a foot of chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I had to get rid of them and
because there was lots of reasons,
[SPEAKER_09]: but I put a foot of chips on this tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have, on your trees,
at the base of your trees, you should have
[SPEAKER_09]: what's called trunk flare, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Trees have a trunk flare.
[SPEAKER_09]: This tree, the chips are up to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It responded this year by producing no
fruit, by getting rust, which it never got
[SPEAKER_09]: rust.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a tree that's probably 50,
60 years old and was terribly butchered.
[SPEAKER_09]: by a previous owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the tree has been stressed and has had
lichens and mosses on it for years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I made a decision, look at you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're such a mess.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I compounded it by adding all those
chips on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's time for a new tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's now took off ground level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very happy with all the light I
have there now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow, that's really much nicer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you see lichens and mosses on
trees, that are in full sun, think stress.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I do for it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can mulch it with chips,
arborist chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add some organic fertilizer to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're putting chips, don't put a
foot of chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're talking a couple inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lichens don't really hurt.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are concerned, oh,
it's killing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I better put some dormant oil on it
because it'll kill the lichens and mosses.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The lichens and mosses, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not a parasite.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: My theory is that the pH of the bark
changes when the plant is under stress,
[SPEAKER_09]: providing a good environment for these
guys to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hazel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: The older you get, the more comfortable
you get saying, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably would open it up and then thin
it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be aware.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got some really good observations
in that half of the tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that half towards?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the north side.
[SPEAKER_09]: The half on the north side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a good indicator, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's light.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think I would try to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_09]: First, this during dormancy, I would
probably take out a third of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Light and air.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those hazelnuts, is it a contorted one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's just a regular.
It's a native.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's a native one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it really thick?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real open.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so it's real open, so therefore it's
not going to be a light and air.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then go to the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on in the soil?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I might try mulching with
arborist chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might try adding some organic
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and nothing still.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the leaves coming out normal when they
come out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'd end up having, I would almost
want to, I don't know whether something's
[SPEAKER_09]: going on in the root system or if
something's going on in the top growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably would cut out the affected
areas and get rid of them off site.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?
Yes.
Good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great question, and I brought a raspberry
over here for that very reason,
[SPEAKER_09]: because I was hoping we would talk
raspberries, and then I forgot,
[SPEAKER_09]: so thanks for bringing this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first question you have to ask is,
are they ever bearing raspberries or are
[SPEAKER_09]: they single crop?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hoping you'd say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pay you later for that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really, what is the difference?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this is bearing fruit right now,
isn't it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is considered an ever bearing
raspberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever bearing raspberries produce fruit
twice a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: They produce fruit on new canes coming up
that bloom in the summer and produce fruit
[SPEAKER_09]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then if I cut this back, because the top's
going to die down, this same cane will
[SPEAKER_09]: produce fruit in June, and then that cane
will die.
[SPEAKER_09]: So raspberry roots are perennial,
the canes are biennial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning all canes of raspberries live for
two years and then they die.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk single crop raspberry real
quickly, if we're okay on time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to have you guys say get out
of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're done with him.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk raspberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk single crop raspberries,
such as what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Such as meeker, such as tulamine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tulamine is by far my most favorite
raspberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: The quality of the fruit is incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it grows its first year, that's called
the primocane, and it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just grows.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might grow six feet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't bloom, doesn't fruit,
doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might produce all these canes coming
up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got all these canes about 18
inches, and they're like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is tulamine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put in a trellis, which is a four by
four trellis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put a cross on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I put in a four by four post and a two by
four cross, and I put wires between them
[SPEAKER_09]: so it looks like a clothesline.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the time of year to do your
pruning is going to be February.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, February is when I'm going to prune
my single crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm going to do is I'm going to take
these guys and I'm going to bend them
[SPEAKER_09]: here, and I'm going to tie them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take this one, bend it here, and tie them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it here, bend it, and tie it,
okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I take this one, bend it,
tie it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take this one, bend it, tie it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Take this one, bend it, tie it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks great in a picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually does work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I only have one on this one because
it only had one cane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this one has two, and I tie it here,
and I tie it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now notice when I tie it, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tipping it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really key.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to tip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to bring this thing over.
[SPEAKER_09]: It may go all the way down to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You tip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it only goes to here, I tip it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that takes that hormone out of the
apical meristem and causes fruit to go
[SPEAKER_09]: here, here, here, here, here, here,
here, here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get fruit all the way along here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want my trellis to be, I like to be
having six feet because what happens,
[SPEAKER_09]: they come out about 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you say, well, that's too high for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be once these guys start
producing fruit coming down this way,
[SPEAKER_09]: okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: So now they produce fruit year two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're in your second year,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: While they are producing fruit,
you have new canes coming up all over the
[SPEAKER_09]: place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I try to keep them inside my box.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep them inside my box.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got new canes coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's next year's fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep those canes growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep them growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep them protected.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now in February, and I always time mine
with jute so that I can just cut it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut them and then they drop off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut and they drop off.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take these guys all the way down to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I remove all these old canes that
produce fruit and then I tie the new ones
[SPEAKER_09]: over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So every year in February, I'm cutting it
down and then I'm reattaching.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now if you're like me, as soon as I'm done
fruiting, as soon as I'm done fruiting,
[SPEAKER_09]: like in September, I like to take out the
old prima canes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I like to give the other one
space.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to give the other one some room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will prune them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll prune them also at that time in
August as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a single crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's an ever bearing, like this guy,
what I like to do, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_09]: want to hear this, I cut them to the
ground every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cut them to the ground every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have a trellis like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I cut them to the ground every year
because the taste of these in July is
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing compared to tulamines.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in September, October, who is
complaining about the taste of these?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fresh raspberry and it tastes so
good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this really came home for me when I
had five kids at home and they were little
[SPEAKER_09]: kids and they wanted dinner, they wanted
to hurry up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like go outside and eat something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go pick something.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go outside and eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go eat something.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would never pick my ever bearing
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember saying, I've got two huge
rows, 75 feet long.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't you picking the ever bearing?
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, they don't even taste good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I started thinking, they don't
even taste good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did a real taste test on the July of
an ever bearing versus July of a single
[SPEAKER_09]: crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was such a difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why am I wasting my time on these ever
bearing?
[SPEAKER_09]: However, in August and September and
October, these ever bearing are the best
[SPEAKER_09]: raspberries you'll ever have.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have the others to compare it
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I like growing both.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't co-mingle them because it's really
hard to tell which is which.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't co-mingle.
[SPEAKER_09]: But a good rule of thumb is if you have a
cane, if you say, well, I don't know
[SPEAKER_09]: whether I have ever bearing or single
crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're getting fruit right now,
it's ever bearing.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're getting fruit on it,
then it's an ever bearing raspberry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they do not produce fruit at this
time of year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And notice the position there at the
terminals.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an ever bearing raspberry versus a
single crop.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't prove just a portion of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could.
[SPEAKER_09]: You certainly could.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people who have ever,
I've talked to people with ever bearing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing you learn with gardeners is that
you don't complain with, you don't teach
[SPEAKER_09]: them how to do anything because they're
going to do what they want to do anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't argue with success.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've had people say, I have ever
bearing and they are the best raspberries
[SPEAKER_09]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep growing them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not here to convince you.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you certainly could.
[SPEAKER_09]: If this was my ever bearing, and I know
people that do this, in the spring,
[SPEAKER_09]: they just cut the tops off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because these die back to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then these are going to produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all going to produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have a variety of ever bearing
that you love, then manage it that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that works out fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just cut back to a node right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll tell you in the spring, it'll
actually die back during the winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you'll be able to say,
oh, it's dead to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's dead to here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do about the fruit fly
maggots?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, there's a little fruit fly
that's a problem with raspberries.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what I do is I do traps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I take a cottage cheese container and I
drill holes in the side, put the lid on
[SPEAKER_09]: it, and I put in apple cider vinegar and
one drop of dish soap.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go in those holes and they drown.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the dish soap keeps them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you mean on raspberries?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you talking about apple maggots?
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple maggots, another story.
[SPEAKER_09]: So apple maggots, which for me,
this was a great year for apple maggots,
[SPEAKER_09]: meaning I didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was the first year that I took
Christmas balls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you know, I bought those little
footy things that you can put them on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought, I am retired and I don't
have time for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to think, well, when I retire,
I'll have time for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it's like, this is a waste.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gave me these?
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I take red Christmas balls and I
paint them with tangle foot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hang out four of them per tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that worked great this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: The female fly, it's a fly, and she sees
the red and says, yes, red apple.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: So she dies there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what she does is she lays her
little ovipositor in the apple and puts an
[SPEAKER_09]: egg in there and the egg hatches into a
maggot, which causes apple maggot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why you don't want to transport
apple maggot fruit because the apple
[SPEAKER_09]: maggots are in there and then they hatch
and then they fly around.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's why I use bright red cheap
Christmas balls, paint it with tangle
[SPEAKER_09]: foot, hang them in your tree, around.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangle foot's a very, you can buy it,
it looks like rubber cement.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the old rubber cement days in the
little glass thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you paint it on it and it's really
sticky.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in the garden department.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they're a fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's nothing in the soil you can put
in there because this fly, you put it in
[SPEAKER_09]: the soil right around there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, you're going to, number one,
you're going to ingest the chemical that
[SPEAKER_09]: you just put in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: But number two, the fly may be coming from
your neighbors or may be coming from all
[SPEAKER_09]: around because it's a fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not a maggot living in the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangle foot?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, once a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw them all out now.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're too sticky and gross and I'm not
going to clean them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the weather has caused the red to come
off and it's just a gross mess.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangle foot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, tangle foot.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got my cue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
