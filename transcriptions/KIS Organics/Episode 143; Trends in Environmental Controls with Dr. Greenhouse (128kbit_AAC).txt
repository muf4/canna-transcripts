[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, just a

[SPEAKER_00]: For this week's podcast, I had the honor
of interviewing Dr. Nadia Saba,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the president and founder of Dr.
Greenhouse, an agricultural and mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering firm that specializes in the
design of HVAC systems for indoor plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Saba has her PhD in agricultural
engineering from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona's Controlled Environment
Agricultural Center, and she is a licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical engineer in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: For over 20 years, she has dedicated her
education and career to helping farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: control their environments, allowing them
to grow crops indoors, in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in facilities that would otherwise be
impossible or impractical to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really excited to catch up again
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been a little while since we
last chatted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been up to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's the new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with every new year,
we think about, you know, what the year
[SPEAKER_01]: before brought us or didn't bring us and
what we hope the next year will bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been thinking a lot about,
you know, about the trends in our industry
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2023 and 2024 and looking ahead and
trying to predict or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: consider, will some of those trends
continue into 2025?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently posted a blog about my
predictions today, my podcast episode
[SPEAKER_01]: going into a little bit more detail on my
predictions and trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It posted today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is January 21st.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're just we're looking
ahead to, you know, looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: more greenhouse projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the biggest trends
that we have seen in the industry across
[SPEAKER_01]: all the crops that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, growing indoors is really energy
intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the Pied Piper is is asking
to have their, you know, their dues paid
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't always panning out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a profitable
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finding new ways to, you know,
increase the bottom line, increase those
[SPEAKER_01]: margins and actually, first off,
just be profitable or at least break even,
[SPEAKER_01]: which a lot of growers haven't been able
to do or it's been very marginal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's only so much you
can do to increase your rate of growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: your your yield and your output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so more and more growers and operators
are looking at how do we cut costs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, energy is, you know,
30 to 50 percent of growers cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on where you are and depending
on what your labor situation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we're seeing a lot of
that as well as, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest in automation and A.I.,
though what I will say as a major gap in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry is is data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people aren't necessarily
collecting data or they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring with, you know, some of the the
monitoring systems that are out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not actually being recorded or
downloaded anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're kind of like kind of
guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have a feel for it on a day to
day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that doesn't necessarily
mean that over, you know, the course of a
[SPEAKER_01]: of a full harvest cycle or a full year or
season, you have more of a gut feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: than the data to support decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're hoping and encouraging
growers to implement, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more robust systems, even again,
if it's not tied into controls and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: still monitoring, like just get a
monitoring system that actually records
[SPEAKER_01]: that data so that we can then even help
you analyze that data if you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, it's, you know, 2025 is going
to be an interesting year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty twenty three and twenty four
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, the last five or seven
years were interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had covid and then we had
inflation and supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, and 280 is drowning the
cannabis industry and oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, OK, how do we sort of
course correct here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, that's what I'm up to is just
thinking about the course, the path
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and how Dr. Greenhouse can fit
into the success of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, production goals and
profitability goals and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: work life balance and, you know,
all all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's what I'm up to thinking
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who are unfamiliar,
the podcast is called The Doctor is in and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find it on all major platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nadia's website is DrGreenhouse.com and
she also I use this fairly regularly is
[SPEAKER_00]: your VPD chart and your VPD app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an app you can download from
the app store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free and you can put in your VPD and
it'll tell you where you land when you
[SPEAKER_00]: enter your your temperature and your
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of resources for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your area of expertise is probably
the area where I feel the least competent
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have a bunch of questions I want
to cover today, but let's just start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with talking about what are your sort of
initial considerations when you walk into
[SPEAKER_00]: a new grow space, like what goes through
your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I realize, like with the variety
of ways that people are growing from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an indoor tent, a four by four
tent to a garage to facilities indoors to
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see all different shapes and
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sizes and not even that, just
different ways that fans are configured
[SPEAKER_00]: and airflow in and out and sealed and
unsealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is a very complicated topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you what do you think about,
though, when you walk into a new space
[SPEAKER_00]: from an environmental perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, thank you for this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one trend of twenty twenty four is
that I was visiting a lot of sites all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the country, both greenhouses and
indoor to really help growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: operators improve the conditions of the
facility that they already have,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than helping investors figure out
where to spend their 20 or 30 million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, OK, how can we spend a few
hundred thousand dollars to improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: asset that we already have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the areas is always climate
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the the the two most
challenging areas in terms of managing the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment has remained the same for 10
or 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for 26 years now is
airflow and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two primary concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so happy that more and more people
are actually shifting away or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they're figuring out the dehumidification
question and are asking more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: about the airflow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I told you earlier, I was just at
a mushroom conference and talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mushroom growers are challenged with
good airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the first thing I look for,
quite honestly, is I am looking at your
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow devices, whether that's a duct,
whether that's a poly tube, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fan coil unit sitting in the corner of
your grow tent, you know, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fans blowing on your plants or not blowing
on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is always the first thing that I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was made fun of many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm a both an agricultural and a
mechanical engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, studied HVAC a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walk into any room and I am looking
up at where the diffusers are,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the return registers are,
where the equipment is, because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's going to affect how I feel
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is true with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the first thing that my
eyeballs go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk into some greenhouses and indoor
farms where fans are pointing in multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: directions, not working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, I mean, it's chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of the first things that
I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first things I'm looking for is how
are we moving air in this space and how
[SPEAKER_01]: are we getting air into this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we using outside air?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it 100 percent circulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it overhead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it under tables?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things, because airflow is,
you know, you can have the right size HVAC
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can have the right capacity of cooling
and dehumidification, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for an entire grow space, whether it's,
you know, 500 square feet or five thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can have the right capacity,
but if you cannot get it to where the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to circulate on itself and
it's not going to do a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we distribute that conditioned
air to a space?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the first things I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I notice right away is the
layout of the room, the plant density.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how tall the plants are,
the different ages if you have multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of times,
right, you have a one room or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that is dedicated, right,
for the next eight weeks, eight to ten
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of growing out, say, a cannabis
flower plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all the ages are the same,
but their morphology is different,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have multiple strains in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have short plants, you have
tall plants, you have medium plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more squat plants or,
you know, more narrow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how how are those plants
configured relative to each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, there are some rooms I
walk into and it looks like a wave,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like you have small plants
next to tall strains, next to small
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, next to tall cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just kind of all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think about, again,
airflow, I'm thinking, well, are those
[SPEAKER_01]: tall plants obstructing airflow to get to
the shorter plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are the shorter plants creating just
like a channel of air in between the tall
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I look for uniformity
also in crop morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to be uniform
necessarily, but it kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we can design a room both the plants
and the air distribution system that works
[SPEAKER_01]: together as opposed to in opposition of
each other or obstructing each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're going to have more uniform
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're not going to have these
hot spots or stagnant corners of the room
[SPEAKER_01]: because air will be able to move freely
within that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of the first two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm noticing if it's single
level, double level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sort of what kind of crop style or
cropping system we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't pay as much attention to
irrigation and the substrate and cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is important, especially if you're
growing, say, in, you know, living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might only be watering once every
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the dynamics of water vapor and
evaporation in that space might be
[SPEAKER_01]: different than if you are growing in
rockwool or cocoa core with drip
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those systems are meant to drain and
you might be irrigating multiple times a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would expect a different
evaporation profile in those rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that I look for
is, is there water everywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not necessarily because of irrigation,
but because of condensation and condensate
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers have dehumidifiers in the
room or fan cool units in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are condensing that water vapor
out of the air through the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And too many times we see overflow of the
drain pan, you know, just water spilling
[SPEAKER_01]: over onto the floor or into the corner of
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we see, you know, that the drain pipe
off the condensate isn't designed
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's backing up and clogging up the
drain pan or, you know, the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: drain to the floor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why that's important to me,
I mean, it's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: On an HVAC perspective, it means that I'm
not controlling the water balance in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room as well as I want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because rather than removing that water
vapor from the room, I'm now just
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroducing it to a spot on the floor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have to re-evaporate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes extra work to do that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to re-evaporate the same water over
and over because it's not leaving the
[SPEAKER_01]: building, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second concern is, you know,
that is a place where algae can grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria can grow, mold can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it becomes a contamination risk
for our growers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those plants, that's not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing is a risk to people
who are working in that space,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now that becomes a slipping
hazard, not just on the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now that slippery algae, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think a lot of people have had
that experience where you slip on that
[SPEAKER_01]: green water and, you know, woo,
kind of catch yourself as you skate
[SPEAKER_01]: across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I noticed water on the
floor and on surfaces because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to control through
dehumanification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I walk through a site,
a lot of times that's the thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: point at, that the maintenance guys come
right away and fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, honestly, I really have fun doing
the site visits and visiting facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's always something to point
out that can be fixed right there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, growers kind of become blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're so fixed on the plants
and on nutrient recipes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, these are really great things to be
focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they should be focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, you know, become blind to the
everyday things that are happening or may
[SPEAKER_01]: not realize what the risk or what the
consequences are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, the last thing I'll just
say is I look for where air is entering or
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving where it shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether it's a greenhouse or an
indoor facility, you know, sometimes we
[SPEAKER_01]: see that the building, the structure isn't
sealed well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the seal around diffusers or
penetration through a wall isn't sealed
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where heat and humidity can
come into your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where heat and humidity can leave
your space in an uncontrolled manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's not great for,
you know, for HVAC control and what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to achieve with our heating,
cooling and dehumidification systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also an energy drain on your
facility because, you know, if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: Minnesota and you're leaking out hot,
humid air, right, that's just more heat
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to have to add into that
greenhouse because there's a hole in your
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're in Arizona, right,
hot, dry air is going to come into one
[SPEAKER_01]: corner or one, you know, spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your room, and you're going to lose
control of that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, looking at the integrity of
the space, looking at the space itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at all the air devices,
it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look, I notice a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you kind of already answered my
next question, but was there anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: can elaborate on in regards to the most
common mistakes you see in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental control or airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned fans pointing in the same
direct or opposite directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of battling each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are, you know, what are some other
things that you see as just common grower
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes on this topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the most
common mistakes is not thinking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: the various pieces of equipment and
systems are going to interact with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have an air conditioning unit
sitting on the wall over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see my hand over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might have an oscillating fan
on the wall over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that oscillating fan is blowing
towards that fan coil unit, that air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning unit sitting on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that air conditioning unit is trying
to blow air away from itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the center of the room,
while that oscillating fan is trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: blow air towards the center of the room in
the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, you don't get good
airflow or good conditioning anywhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you might have good airflow near the
fan, but it's, you know, crappy
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then away from the fan where that fan
coil unit is, you might have really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: dry air over on this side of the room,
but it never makes it to the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's just kind of one
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or where your heaters are located in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have an HAF fan pointing
at the heater, you know, the heat is just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to blow right back on on top of the
heater rather than being carried away from
[SPEAKER_01]: the heater and into the greenhouse and
over the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the biggest thing that I
see is, look, you know, can you move this
[SPEAKER_01]: fan over here or can, you know,
we can't can we change the direction of of
[SPEAKER_01]: those fans, you know, rather than blowing
in that direction, can I blow in the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite direction and turn it around?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest mistakes that I
see is just not really paying attention or
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing how to sort of facilitate
conditioning the space with the fans that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, I mean, you know,
I'm just going to stick with fans for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big sort of biggest head
slappers that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, I'm like allergic to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nose is itching like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the the biggest head slappers that
I have when I walk into rooms is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: see HAF horizontal airflow fans and
vertical airflow fans or VAF fans in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same space operating at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you have these HAF fans that are
trying to blow over the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have these VAF fans that are
trying to, you know, suck air from the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the canopy and kind of
distribute it over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I can I pause you for something with
just a quick definitions for folks who may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be familiar with this terminology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about horizontal air
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airflow, which is where a fan that's your
typical oscillating fan that goes back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth or sitting there pushing air,
I guess, horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really easily defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a vertical airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those suck air up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that is that the best way to describe
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm picturing kind of like a nuclear bomb
explosion that shape mushroom cloud shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's a really good analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just you know, I'm familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't understand it and I still
don't fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm glad you brought up
oscillating fans as part of sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: HAF horizontal airflow fan community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, HAF fans are really designed to
to move air horizontally and usually over
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you see them sort of
suspended from the trusses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you see them hanging on the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it's a horizontal motion of
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vertical airflow fans really come in two
styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most common one that I see are the
ones that, like you described,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a mushroom cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They suck air from underneath them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they go through the fan,
then they blow air out the top of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: over the top, then sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some ways they act.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a horizontal airflow trajectory
as they leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that air then filters down in and
under the plant canopy and then gets
[SPEAKER_01]: sucked back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of creates like the circular
motion around the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have both fans that are
blowing horizontally and fans that are
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing vertically, what is the direction
of airflow you're going to get in the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads me to another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main reason that we don't want air
crashing into each other is the main
[SPEAKER_00]: reason just because you end up with
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't get good homogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big, big reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just get air kind of banging
into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get these erratic areas of high
velocity and low velocity and no velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like creating hot spots,
but of air motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you might have air that's moving
upwards, downwards, sideways, diagonally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so predicting where those spots are
going to be is really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, that's not the point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is to create homogeneity,
is to create uniformity in hopes that your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop is all going to grow at the same rate
and with the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If now, if you have a high velocity area
over here and a low velocity over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants are going to grow very
differently, even if the temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a wind chill factor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be outside and it's warm
outside, but if the air is still,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're so much more uncomfortable than if
there's a breeze, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it helps to basically pull heat
away from our bodies when it's windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same idea is true with circulation
fans and plants, is that if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: high velocity, then it's going to pull
more water vapor away from your plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to stress your plant
potentially and require it to use more
[SPEAKER_01]: water to deliver nutrients and to keep it
lush, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have an area of stagnant
airflow, then your plant might not
[SPEAKER_01]: evapotranspire enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it doesn't move nutrients at all
to the tips of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might see leaf tip burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked about that in the
past, Tad, is leaf tip burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see that under both
conditions, really high velocity or really
[SPEAKER_01]: low velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal is to get sort of a medium
velocity everywhere in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the biggest mistakes is
when I see a combination of fans,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen oscillating fans and vertical
fans, oscillating fans, and then those
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal fans that are kind of
positioned in a racetrack configuration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've seen all of that with also
under bench fans or under bench air tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is always, what are you
trying to accomplish with all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: fans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what so many growers say is we want to
see the plants dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where that term was coined,
but I don't necessarily want to see plants
[SPEAKER_01]: dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see maybe a little bit of
movement, but if plants are dancing,
[SPEAKER_01]: then chances are your air velocity is too
high and you're going to stress the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's interesting about this is
as you're saying this, I want to go in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room right this minute and change
some things that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing under canopy airflow at the
moment through a greenhouse convection
[SPEAKER_00]: tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have, because my room is so,
my exterior air is so cold and I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: condition it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lung room necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to limit the amount of air
exchange that I have into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to talk CO2 as well,
because I think that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that people don't necessarily talk
about enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am supplementing CO2 into the air
tube, which then pushes it up when it does
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm about a thousand PPM CO2 just to
throw out a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the under air canopy or
under canopy airflow because I'm getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger volume of air moved in probably,
I guess, a lower velocity and it's pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: the air up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting CO2 delivered where I want
it, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also have an oscillating fan
that was above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that the plants have grown,
I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hitting the canopy and I was seeing
less growth on the side where the fan was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned the fan off and now I'm
thinking I need to take it down and put a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan to get air circulation around the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I probably have stagnant air
everywhere else that the under canopy air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow is not hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard to describe these things
without a visual, but I think these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the sort of things that you should be
thinking about as you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to think it out out
loud as we're going through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love it when growers come up to
me and say, hey, you know, like I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: what your recommendations were on air
velocity and I adjusted my fans to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: that range and it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I usually expect is that they're
saying that it's too low, that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: too low of a velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I've had more people tell me
that they figured out that they had too
[SPEAKER_01]: high of a velocity and that once they
turned down the velocity of their fans or
[SPEAKER_01]: removed some fans or reconfigured them so
they weren't beating up their plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that their yield just shot through the
roof, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like their plants just thrived so much
better by not, you know, just knocking
[SPEAKER_01]: them over with wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when it comes to cannabis,
the ultimate goal, at least in the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room, is to produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have a high air speed,
what that does is that triggers the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to bulk up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to put more of its
resources into increasing its stem
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter and beefing up its, you know,
its stems and petioles and leaves to
[SPEAKER_01]: withstand, you know, this high wind
velocity rather than putting those
[SPEAKER_01]: resources into the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're stealing from the plant or from
the flower production when we have these
[SPEAKER_01]: really high air velocities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for all of you listening,
the target is 0.35 to 1 meter per second,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about 200 to 350 feet per minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you start going over that,
I mean, it's not the end of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what we don't want to see is double
that because your plants are just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, be more vegetative than
being reproductive, generative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you shared a really interesting gem
of knowledge on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years back in regards to a
photo I'd put up about I was doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: trivia questions where people try and
guess what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this photo, a fan had fallen over
and was just blasting this one area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these leaves were damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you can you talk about what was
actually going on within the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: evapotranspiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I thought that was so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so when plants take up nutrients,
usually with every nutrient except one,
[SPEAKER_01]: they move by osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go from an area of high
concentration at the root zone to low
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, which is, you know,
within the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how most of, you know,
these chemicals, that's really what they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, or molecules move through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one exception is calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium does not move through osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually gets carried by water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the water moves too quickly through
the plant because you have a high demand
[SPEAKER_01]: for evapotranspiration, then that calcium
will get left behind and won't get
[SPEAKER_01]: deposited to the ends of the plants,
to the tips of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If evapotranspiration is too slow,
then the water isn't moving fast enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry the calcium to where it needs to be
before it becomes deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that so you can see a phenomenon called
leaf tip burn, where the edges of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, of the leaves on your plant,
get crispy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower has seen a crispy leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you buy lettuce, you know,
in a clam shell, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the grocery store, you might see brown
tips on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rotted.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, you know, necessarily
wrong with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't have calcium at the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it becomes crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was your trivia
question was, you know, what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: to this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I seeing these, you know,
brown edges, you know, to the tips of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it kind of looks similar to
a nitrogen deficiency where you get
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing tips, right, and other nutrient
deficiencies, but it's that brown
[SPEAKER_01]: crispiness that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can touch the tips of that plant
and it kind of crunches, then that is leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: tip burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let me just back up for a second,
because I know I've used the term
[SPEAKER_01]: evapotranspiration, and maybe not
everybody knows what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a plant moves water and nutrients
through the process of transpiration up
[SPEAKER_01]: from the roots and to the rest of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so transpiration is literally that
motion, that movement of water and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients up and through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what drives transpiration is this term
VPD, or vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which Tad mentioned we have an app so that
you can figure out what the right VPD is
[SPEAKER_01]: or what your VPD conditions are based off
of the temperature and humidity in your
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to call VPD the pressure on a
plant to transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the drier it is in the space,
the more water is going to want to move
[SPEAKER_01]: from the roots and out into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have a high VPD,
that's a dry room or dry air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your plant will transpire a lot more,
moving water very quickly at a very rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: rate through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a low vapor pressure deficit,
that's usually a high relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the pressure on the plant to
transpire is much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so water and nutrients move much more
slowly through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you, for instance, are only
watering once every two or three days and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a really high VPD, which means a
low relative humidity, it's high and dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it high VPD and dry room condition,
then your plant is going to use a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: water to push out into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you might notice is if you have a
really dry room, that your plant over time
[SPEAKER_01]: might actually start to wilt, because now
there's not enough water at the root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to support the pressure on the
plant to transpire that water,
[SPEAKER_01]: pull it up from the soil into the roots,
through the plant and out into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might find that you need to
water more frequently if you have a high
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, if the relative humidity is really
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, what's one of
the things I love about transpiration is
[SPEAKER_01]: that for non woody plants like,
like cannabis, for example, turgor
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure is what actually holds the plant
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turgor pressure is created by the
movement of water and by the water
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing outwards on the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what holds your plant up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your plant starts to wilt,
then that means you don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration to literally hold the plant
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, one of the ways that you
can actually conserve water is by lowering
[SPEAKER_01]: your vapor pressure deficit, by increasing
your relative humidity, your plant won't
[SPEAKER_01]: demand as much water and guess what,
it also won't demand as many nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna conserve water and you're
gonna reduce your nutrient load or your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient demand for the plant,
regardless of what type of growing system
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can train a plant very young,
even, you know, at this sort of small veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: mini veg stage to be sort of drought
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start the plant with a high
relative humidity, it will teach itself to
[SPEAKER_01]: conserve water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can carry that through for
the next two to three months with that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant until you harvest it and not
require, you know, such a low relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say happily that one of the trends
I have seen in the cannabis industry is a
[SPEAKER_01]: movement away from 75 degrees and 50%
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As people are switching to LEDs or
realizing there's not as much radiant
[SPEAKER_01]: heat, so they have to raise that to the
temperature of the room and growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: learning that maybe we don't need such a
dry condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can raise that relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seeing, you know, increases,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 50%, 100% increases in yields because
they're allowing themselves to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity closer to 65 or 70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of growers are doing that,
but the ones that are are reaping the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I'm seeing more people running
higher humidities and I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that what you were describing in
the leaf scenario is that some minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: will move through the xylem, which is
where water moves, and some minerals move
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly through the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And minerals that move through the xylem
would have the effect that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium would be another one,
too, with that leaf tip scenario that you
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are familiar with the
botany side of things, I just think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a post on root hairs talking
about how root hair death is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that we see a limitation,
whether over watering or under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we're killing root
hairs and that limits the plant's ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to uptake water, uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can have a downstream effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to what you're describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that can create
the same visual symptoms from totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the better we understand the why
behind that, the better we can be as
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you were able to share
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question I have for you is
because you brought up turgor pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got absolutely roasted a year or two ago
because I made a comment that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: watching my plants and they were doing
what people call praying, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially, let's call it a 45 degree
leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made the comment, I was like,
this leaf angle to me looks to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-optimal from a solar panel
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get the most light from,
let's say, a static light, like indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our leaves are at this angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me like if they were flatter,
they would get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is the plant doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were just like, you're an
idiot's turgor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, OK, yes, I realize that turgor
pressure is determining the leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why is the plant doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen very unhealthy plants do
this, that were nutrient deficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: that had less than optimal fertility or
other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hypotheses was that it was
because the plant was trying to access
[SPEAKER_00]: more CO2 because it was a CO2 or maybe it
was a CO2, I think it was a CO2 deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're looking at me like you
may have some thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to shut up now and hear what
you have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those are all interesting theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CO2 one is actually very interesting,
but really it's to protect itself from you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned maybe a high light condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what it's doing,
is that if it is growing in a stressful
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where it's maybe really dry or
there is a nutrient deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's trying to do is protect itself
from collecting more sun than it can use
[SPEAKER_01]: and then being photo bleached or becoming
even more nutrient deficient because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to keep up with the rate of
photosynthesis that it could be doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the PAR that's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that case, if you're growing,
if you have LED lights and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: dimming controls and I would turn it down
so that the plants don't burn themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are some plants,
I'm actually curious about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone has tested this,
but you know, like if you look at like red
[SPEAKER_01]: kale or red leaf lettuce, that red pigment
is anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the scientific community basically
agrees that that is the plant's own
[SPEAKER_01]: sunscreen, that that red pigment only gets
activated when the plant is exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it produces its own sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to go out and buy some
beach bomb or, you know, some,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, why can't I think it must be
winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can't think of any product names
for sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's probably what the plant is
doing is protecting itself from
[SPEAKER_01]: overproducing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From over consuming itself, because what
will happen, kind of like what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with humans, if we're nutrient deficiency
deficient, then we start pulling from our
[SPEAKER_01]: bones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We start pulling protein from our muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we deteriorate ourselves to
keep our vital organs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the same will be true for plants is
that they're going to pull from wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: they can to keep their basic functions
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just going to perpetuate the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what plants will do in some cases
is that they will pray, they will close
[SPEAKER_01]: their leaves so that they aren't exposed
to so much sunlight so that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of forced, I guess, to
photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they have another
mechanism, I'm sure they do, to slow or
[SPEAKER_01]: stop the photosynthesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I didn't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't I didn't notice you were looking
at me slowly until I finished talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you got that recorded what I
said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, because it is recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then we'll come back to praying
plants another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have other questions about it,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to continue because I know
we're going to get a lot of pushback on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know what I said,
do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you were well, I caught some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you were saying that it was
a plant response to limit light due to
[SPEAKER_00]: other environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it can reduce or slow its
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I mentioned is that,
you know, plants will kind of do what
[SPEAKER_01]: humans do, where, you know, humans,
if we're nutrient deficient, we'll start
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling right nutrients from our bones,
you write calcium from our bones,
[SPEAKER_01]: protein and amino acids from our muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our body will start to deteriorate
in order to keep our basic organ functions
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants might do the same,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are, you know, really active and,
you know, are photosynthesizing more than
[SPEAKER_01]: their environment or their nutrients or
water can support them, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would start pulling from various
places to keep their basic functions
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants have a mechanism in order to
protect themselves from that, which is to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, close their leaves so that
they're not exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the chlorophyll is not exposed
to photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense to me, except for to
play devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see plants prey typically when,
well, at night, they'll tend to droop and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'll perk back up, you know,
when the day starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that light level increase or that
transition from night to day will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we do certain nutrient applications
or on really happy, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for many growers, I would say the
standard of a healthy plant is when they
[SPEAKER_00]: do some sort of application intervention
in the plant leaves prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like there are multiple
variables or mechanisms that can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: this leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are quite positive,
potentially, and some of them may not be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that we can't necessarily use it as a
diagnosis to say this is a healthy plan or
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a unhealthy plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know that I would
consider a praying plant healthy or
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might just be a protective
mechanism that could just be temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, it doesn't necessarily indicate
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it doesn't necessarily indicate that
there is something systemically wrong with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant or how you're growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also, you know, could be that the plant
is protecting itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just thinking about in
California poppies like clothes at night
[SPEAKER_01]: and then open during the daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of those mechanisms is to
protect itself from frost and from
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from other, you know, environmental
hazards at night when it's not active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see that being, you know,
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, you know, if a plant
is praying at night, it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, plants are respiring all the
time and, you know, are only
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesizing during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so photosynthesis exceeds the rate of
respiration during the daytime hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see, you know, an excess of oxygen
getting produced during the daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at nighttime, we actually,
you know, see more carbon dioxide getting
[SPEAKER_01]: let off by the plant at night,
which a lot of people are concerned about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, my God, my CO2 levels increased
at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that unhealthy for the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there has been no scientific research
to say that high CO2 levels at night are
[SPEAKER_01]: bad for any horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a natural process because plants
are always producing CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always respiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it could be that that shift from
photosynthesis to respiration as being the
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant process might also be affecting
this sort of praying mechanism that plants
[SPEAKER_01]: do even at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also it could be a water conservation
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, yeah, the stomata are on
the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might seem counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if we're slowing the rate of
photosynthesis, then the stomata don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to work as hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, then they might be more
closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think they're more open,
but they might be more closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like the theory of increasing
access to stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to CO2, maybe at that angle for
airflow purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also other people said maybe it's
actually an increasing the amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's able to penetrate into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually getting increased
photosynthesis by having that leaf angle
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're getting more light access
to more canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of wanted to hear what you
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are so smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still learning, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the funny thing about that I
love about what we do is we're always
[SPEAKER_00]: learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have some other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of got off topic there with
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about energy
solutions, because one of the things I see
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is something that I am dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just give you a real world example
as a way to kind of maybe bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: together for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, I mentioned that I'm in
a room, it's mostly sealed because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good lungs lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm bringing in air, it's it's
pretty cold air this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to limit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also want air exchange and my
room will get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm evacuating my hot air to bring
in cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'm losing my CO2 that I've
generated with either from the plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil or through artificial means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this dance of like, how do I
maintain the temperature and humidity that
[SPEAKER_00]: I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my room and the proper airflow and the
proper CO2 to match my light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, keep you know,
so I don't want to put in, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: my temperature is now too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have to put in an air
conditioner, which generates more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: just to lower the temperature with the
heat that I've intentionally created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see this on a, you know,
on a larger scale, say commercially where
[SPEAKER_00]: people end up essentially your equipment
just fighting itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Equipment is fighting itself all the time,
whether it's CO2 versus heating and
[SPEAKER_01]: cooling, or it's cooling versus
dehumidification, or it's heating versus
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just is kind of the nature of
the beast because for one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're asking equipment to manage energy
within the space, which we call light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're asking equipment to do all this
workload that varies over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies from hour to hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies from day to night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies from week to week, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're asking equipment to do all
this work and find the right balance so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can hit our temperature,
humidity, CO2, light, everything targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, on your specific example,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to carbon dioxide and
conditioning a space, one trick that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do is, okay, so let's say you have a,
it's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it's like 65 degrees outside and
the relative humidity is like 30 or 40 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, inside you're trying to
maintain it to be 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, 65% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know that you can use that outside
air to cool and dehumidify your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're like, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to turn on an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to turn on a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to turn on a heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can just ventilate this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're like, but I also want to enrich
this space with carbon dioxide to hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a thousand or 1300 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to dump all that CO2
outside, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm
trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep up with how much is happening is
usually first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the lights turn on and your plants
wake up, if you enrich that room with
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon dioxide for that first hour or two,
before you need, before the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiring really hard, before heat
really builds up in your greenhouse or in
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow, then you can still get a really
big benefit from enriching that space with
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 for just 30 minutes to a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a lot of research with other
horticultural crops has shown that just
[SPEAKER_01]: by, by enriching for the first hour before
you vent has an increase in yields,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, tomatoes of 10 to 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for that short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it, it's,
it's like your plants when they wake up
[SPEAKER_01]: are taking this big breath, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like think about when you wake up,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I catch myself every morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I know that I'm awake when I
take that, that big gulp of air in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, I'm awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to go now that I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same as true with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are gonna use the most CO2,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're first kind of waking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could do the same at the end
of the day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As maybe you're turning down your lights
and your plants are still
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesizing, still transpiring,
even after you turn the lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about 30 minutes for your plants
to acclimate after the lights turn on or
[SPEAKER_01]: after the lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, stomata don't just
instantaneously open and close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes 15 to 30 minutes for them to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could even after you turn off the
lights and there's still all that energy
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room and the stomata are still
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enrich with CO2, pump that room with
carbon dioxide and get it into those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those stomates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're gonna be slowing
their photosynthetic process, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be giving that CO2 to kind of boost,
give it a boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one recommendation that we give
to everyone is look, before you turn on
[SPEAKER_01]: those exhaust fans, before you open that
economizer or let in outside air,
[SPEAKER_01]: enrich with CO2, but then turn it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, unfortunately our,
you know, ambient CO2 levels are
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're still gonna get a good,
you know, you're never going to deplete
[SPEAKER_01]: your room of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using fresh air, you're just
going to be limited to whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, which right now is about 400
parts per million, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than maybe we want it to be as
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want to just reiterate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were saying that there is research
to support this idea of just adding CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first hour of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe again, the first hour of the
dark cycle and seeing increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a big one right there for
people, especially in greenhouses or other
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would add, if you are bringing
in outside air, just a friendly reminder
[SPEAKER_00]: to filter it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or use something to limit the intake of
pathogens and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you recommend a myrrh filter versus
a HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just touch on that really
quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you really need is a myrrh 11
filter to filter out mold spores and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, everything bigger than
that is going to be pollen, insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dander, dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, but really what you're
probably most concerned about are insects
[SPEAKER_01]: and mold spores and a myrrh 11 filter is
plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we usually recommend for an air
conditioning system is if you can put two
[SPEAKER_01]: filters in series with each other,
one right after the other, a myrrh of
[SPEAKER_01]: eight filter, um, which will screen out
the insects and the dust and the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: and the big stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then a myrrh of 11 or 13 filter
after that, which can then focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: filtering out the smaller stuff like the
mold spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that's all you really need,
uh, for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to touch on why not HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: HEPA filters are designed to filter out
very small, um, particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So viruses and bacteria are good examples
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all plant viruses are soil and water
born.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are or, or by surface, uh,
they are not airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are using a HEPA filter thinking
that you are filtering out viruses and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that's going to infect the
surface of your plant, you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, what you are doing is maybe
helping, you know, um, filter out viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for your staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the cold virus, the Corona viruses
and flu viruses aren't circulating around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not going to help your plants
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to help your plants is having
good water filtration, um, and good,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hygienic practices of,
of cutting and pruning and, and managing
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 question for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so for people that are not
supplementing CO2, how much air exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: do we need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think of people who have,
for example, a grow tent and maybe that
[SPEAKER_00]: air is just sitting in that grow tent in
circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they don't, maybe for odor
control or just the way they have set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have enough, maybe they just
have a passive air intake into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what sort of limitations, like I know
with my room, if I, if I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I don't bring in air, I'll get down
into the three hundreds for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to assume when I'm down in
those levels that my plant is struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, grow efficiently given the light
levels being at 900, a thousand PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not, I'm not maximizing my growth
potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CO2 would be the limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we, as we move to, you know,
a more sealed environment, how important
[SPEAKER_00]: is that supplementation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wow, there are, this is a very
multi-pronged answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, well, it, I mean, it depends on so
many factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first off, it depends on how
many plants you have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you have one plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a thousand plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's going to affect how much
CO2 those plants are going to sequester
[SPEAKER_01]: and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and so that's the first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second question is how old is your
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A younger plant is going to use less
carbon dioxide than an older plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, you know, just those two
factors alone have a big impact on how
[SPEAKER_01]: much, um, CO2 enrichment you need,
or, you know, just what the rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: really what the rate of CO2 uptake is by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know how much either, you know,
ambient 400 part per million air you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to add, or how much, you know,
enrichment you need, uh, what the rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: enrichment needs to be to achieve say a
thousand parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then there's other factors,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pushing plants with high light
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pushing plants, right, with maybe
higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so those two factors, um,
light and temperature, um, affects the
[SPEAKER_01]: rate of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have really high light and
really high temperatures, I say really
[SPEAKER_01]: high temperatures, maybe that's 83 or 85
degrees, um, and you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1500 PPFD, um, as your, your light level,
you're going to be pushing those plants a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot harder than if you're at 800 PPFD and
75 degrees, um, you know, set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the rate of CO2 uptake is
going to depend on both the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: factors and your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I can't really answer that,
um, specifically, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a case by case basis, I guess I would
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a good rule of thumb,
um, except to say that usually if you
[SPEAKER_01]: assume one air change per hour,
which is very low, this is like barely
[SPEAKER_01]: doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically just having a leaky
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's usually enough, um,
to manage uh, or maintain CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, for the majority of plant
growing environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one ACH is one air exchange of
between outside and inside air per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way that you figure that out is
you, you know, you measure the square
[SPEAKER_01]: footage of your space and then you
multiply that by the height of the room
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's your volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so you want one volume to turn
over with the outside air replenished with
[SPEAKER_01]: outside air every hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, so if you, if you exchange one
volume of inside air with outside air
[SPEAKER_01]: every hour, that's usually enough to
maintain, you know, ambient CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, okay, this is my absolute last
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when- I didn't know we're going to talk
so much about CO2, but I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and then, well, this isn't about CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more just about, so if you were,
if a company were to reach out to you or a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, what sort of services do you
offer around these sorts of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what does that process look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, cause I've been in some, some of these
meetings with you as just on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: listening in sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what sort of services does Dr.
Greenhouse offer for facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, we, we are,
you know, mechanical and agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: engineers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that focus really on environmental
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, you know, other special
specialists in those areas, including
[SPEAKER_01]: UTAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, you know, we really focus on
the air, on the aerial environment around
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so within that, one thing that we
do almost on every single project,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we're designing it, all the way
through to get a building permit for your
[SPEAKER_01]: new facility, or just doing a peer review
or a gut check of the equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thinking of installing in your grow
room, uh, is a load calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mentioned earlier, we,
you know, we call it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the energy that's in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call the load, uh, the cooling load,
the heating load, because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're then going to remove or add back
into the air with our HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the very first thing is we calculate
how much heating, cooling, and
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification or humidification you
need based off of what you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of lights you have, what your
irrigation rates are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these sorts of variables, um,
so that then we can help you pick the
[SPEAKER_01]: right equipment, the right size equipment,
the right type of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you've picked out, you know,
a dehumidifier and maybe an air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioner, uh, and you want to make sure
that you got the right size, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can calculate what the right size will
be and tell you, yep, you're on the right
[SPEAKER_01]: track or, uh, you might want to,
you know, bump the size up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it's not going to give you enough
dehumidification at your conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, or it's way oversized,
uh, cause you know, you weren't sure or
[SPEAKER_01]: the engineer wasn't sure cause they've
never done a grow room before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you can save half the
price if you just, you know, get the right
[SPEAKER_01]: size equipment, which is not going to just
help you with the first cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help you with the operating
costs cause you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: running, right, bigger equipment that has
a larger electrical or gas load,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the, and, and we're,
we do that, we do that level of work for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, every one from, you know,
500 square foot, you know, small grower
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, 50,000, a hundred thousand
square foot, uh, you know, fancy indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we've saved our clients probably
millions of dollars, um, just doing those
[SPEAKER_01]: two things, uh, beyond that we're hired a
lot to help with airflow and to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually, you know, calculate
how much CO2 your plants are going to use
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you know how much you need to then
add if you want to enrich the room with
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we can get you dialed into that
number as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have a, you know,
bigger tank outside than you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, that those canisters are
going to be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, on airflow,
we've been called a lot more, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: recently on helping with airflow design
and improving the air flow situation in
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grows, greenhouses, you know,
and, you know, if you are growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple levels, which I'm sure a lot of
your listeners are growing in two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, whether that's for clone or veg or
flower, you know, I mean, it gets really
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start working in three
dimensions, how do we get air moving down
[SPEAKER_01]: below and up above and through,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are basically the three
variables that we're trying to manage with
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there are some, um,
pre-packaged, I would say prefabricated
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there for, you know, multi-level,
uh, uh, grow racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish they were engineered a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so we've actually come through
and, and, and helped growers to improve on
[SPEAKER_01]: those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we've also custom designed those
systems, you know, and, and the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about that, you know, like, if you think
about like, you might spend 20 or $30,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Installing like an in-rack, um,
air distribution system that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: was designed to make your plants dance,
but they're only dancing in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dancing at the ends because it
wasn't really engineered, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, like you think you're
saving money because you're not hiring an
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer or consultant like us to,
you know, to, to do the calculation and
[SPEAKER_01]: the analysis, to tell you what you need to
do, to tell you how much airflow you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to move from end to end, to make sure that
it's picking up the right condition of air
[SPEAKER_01]: at the other end of the rack, um,
to size the ducks or that plenum that's
[SPEAKER_01]: running from end to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it, but again, we save our clients
a lot of money by doing that because we
[SPEAKER_01]: get it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not over-engineered.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know exactly the fan size, the duck
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have relationships with duck
providers who will design that duck to our
[SPEAKER_01]: specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we say we want an air velocity at the
plant level of 0.75 meters per second,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we get from end to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you don't have to hire a
consultant later to fix something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you were saving money on early,
um, in the, in the design and
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have a grower,
you know, we have a client that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a single level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we specialty custom designed this
fabric duct system, worked really closely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what angle do we want the air to
leave?
[SPEAKER_01]: What velocity do we want to achieve as the
plants are growing from small to big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and can we hit all angles,
um, on that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they first started it up,
that's all they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, you know, use the fabric ducks
and I walked through and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, it feels amazing in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, when you walk into a room
and it just feels like butter,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you just know it feels right,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't feel a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have air blowing on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's not like stagnant and weird
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just felt so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got a new grower and that
new grower was like, we need fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just installed fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the room is in chaos because the
fabric ducks were designed to do what they
[SPEAKER_01]: were supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they installed fans,
just like I was talking about the VAF
[SPEAKER_01]: versus HAF fans, it created a chaotic
situation above the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some plants got a lot of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other plants didn't get any air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fabric ducks were just kind of,
you know, that air was just getting kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like swirled around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without ever hitting the canopy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I asked them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I encouraged them, look, turn the fans off
in one room and see if it's any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, but it's really hard sometimes
to convince a grower who is used to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing, who didn't maybe have this
system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In their previous growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really blame them because
they're not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't there when we designed it all
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're like, hey, this is missing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked me like, what do I see when I
walk into a grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet that grower walked in and was like,
what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fans in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you moving air around,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't ask, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, you know, did what they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now they had to hire me back to fix
the problem that they didn't have in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, you know, we want to help
growers get things done right the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, I've been going to
a lot of facilities this last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping to permanently fix Band-Aids,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many growers have put Band-Aids
on top of Band-Aids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to invest in the right control system
or the right fan system or reinvest in air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's face it, after five or six
or seven years, like those units have
[SPEAKER_01]: reached their end of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've reached their end of life as we've
pushed them to run every day through snow
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we're being asked to,
hey, you know, we had this air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we want you to come back and give us
the right thing as we're considering
[SPEAKER_01]: replacing the old equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if we can get into these
facilities and help you earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better it's going to be for you in the
end because you're not going to be banging
[SPEAKER_01]: your head against the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why isn't this working?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my equipment is over cycling and
I'm over and under shooting all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing these spikes in the morning and
spikes at night when I turn the lights on
[SPEAKER_01]: and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can help you manage those variables so
that it just makes your day easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hate it when I say I walk into a
grow facility and that's what the grower's
[SPEAKER_01]: job has become, is just sitting in front
of a computer screen, watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity levels fluctuate
in, you know, multiple rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're trying to like, you know,
flip switches and turn dials, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's, you know, literally or
figuratively at the computer screen or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, trying to manage it on
almost like a minute by minute basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's maddening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the equipment is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The control systems are out there to do
the majority of that work for you so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can focus on what it is you want to be
doing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is playing with nutrient recipes,
playing with lighting recipes,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying new cultivars and strains,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, the fun stuff about growing
plants, growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I just want to say really
quickly, like I found you over a day or a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade ago through CannaCon because the
speaker that was the expert on HVAC came
[SPEAKER_00]: in and he was referencing you for all of
the research that he was sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super excited to go to the source
and meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really just grateful that you're
willing to share some of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I hope that we can catch up
again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you so much for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always have great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going on tangents because they're
always relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you talk to a lot of
growers who have these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really feel like when I talk to you,
I'm speaking to your audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: to growers out there, because you're just
sort of translating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just sort of... I try my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the opportunity again to
talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
Thank you.
