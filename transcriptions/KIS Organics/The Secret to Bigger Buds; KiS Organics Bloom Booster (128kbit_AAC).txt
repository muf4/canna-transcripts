[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tad here with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you about a new product
that we've released recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our new bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a 286 and I wanted to show you a
couple ways you can apply it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I have this jalapeno pepper,
large plant, small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got about a tablespoon of our
bloom booster and I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle it in on top and then reach in
here with my hands and scratch it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that into the top upper layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just follow it up by
watering it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even better, if you have a little bit
of soil or compost or worm castings for
[SPEAKER_00]: this cannabis plant here, this is,
this is a great example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take about a quarter
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a half a cup per five gallons
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means about a quarter cup here and
mix it with just a little bit of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can just pop dress this onto
the top of the pot and then water that in
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to give you a nice
phosphorus and potassium boost for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and allow you to grow a really
good, healthy plant, get a better yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and go all the way through to harvest in a
much smaller container with the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals of a commercially available
organic bloom booster on the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking it out.
Thanks for watching.
