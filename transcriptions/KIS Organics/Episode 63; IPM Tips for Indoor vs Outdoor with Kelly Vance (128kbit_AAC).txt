[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before starting the podcast,
I want to catch you up on a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on a seed starter mix
that is now available on the website that
[SPEAKER_00]: is affordable, and works great with both
cannabis and veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been working for the past two
years on a soil mix collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Swallow Living Soils in Canada,
and that mix is now available for folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, as well as a version of our
nutrient pack for re-amending soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since many of us are stuck at home
during this global pandemic, I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good time to do some virtual
tours of some commercial grow facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: and field live questions while we talk to
the head grower about some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be hosting these on Instagram,
and I'll be announcing the dates soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to give us a follow at KIS
Organics if you want to join in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting on with the podcast, this week's
podcast is all about pest management and
[SPEAKER_00]: is a two-part interview with Kelly Vance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly came to Beneficial Insectary in 2016
after a 17-year career in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental and landscape pest management
with a strong focus on biological controls
[SPEAKER_00]: and soft chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since joining the team in Reading,
he's worked in a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental, food, and hemp cannabis crops,
developing biocontrol programs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: myriad of crop pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has written company literature and is
developing a series of release videos for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Beneficial website as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly moved to Reading from Salem,
Oregon in November 2018 and covered the
[SPEAKER_00]: western United States for Beneficial
Insectary before moving into the IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: technical lead position, coordinating the
IPM team's support of customers all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Kelly, thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tad, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it took a little while to put this
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a very, very busy guy,
or at least you were before all this virus
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but I'm excited to get you on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off talking a little bit
about your background because I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting how you got into
working with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about,
you know, even going back to what got you
[SPEAKER_00]: into horticulture and what you did before
working at Beneficial Insectary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a little telling of my age
because it goes back about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started in pest management at
the age of 20, primarily doing turf and
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually called LNO in the state of
Florida, lawn and ornamental.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the company that I worked for,
we also did indoor pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at age 20, I was really
mainly dealing with cockroaches and ants
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of little retirement communities in
the state of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of turf pests, a lot of pests in the
landscapes that they had put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, it was all chemical approach
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned that no bug was a good bug
and we scorched the earth for many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company that I worked for was also
really big into acquiring other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually we bought the nurse tree
that we bought a lot of landscape plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from because we also had a landscape
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was just I was thrown into a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a little bit to learn,
a little bit of a learning curve for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good thing we started small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was still really going pretty hard
with chemicals up until, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started just seeing a lot of
pesticide resistance, also just dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with sometimes a supply that was limited
and not being replenished as often as it
[SPEAKER_01]: could have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of dabbling into biocontrol
back then, but I'm only going to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just releasing ladybugs,
getting disappointed when they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do some nematodes and actually did
see some action with nematodes against
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of taught me the thing can work
and maybe I'm not dedicating enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a while I left after almost nine
years at that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left and started my own pest control
company, also doing turf management,
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn service and tree work and pretty much
every kind of just general gardener work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sold that company back to the company I
worked for when I moved out west in 2011
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a grower position at Fessler
Nursery in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a professional nursery it was
800,000 square feet of greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing annuals, bedding plants,
fuchsias, huge poinsettia crop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was really a study in scaling
out for me and you never would have
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that that's when I'd go into
biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that anybody from the
Willamette Valley or the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_01]: that's growing plants knows a lot about is
thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing up in the southeast I know a lot
about spider mites and it's not that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know about thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't know that thrips could
attack the way that they do when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: out on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a reason they're western
flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gerbera daisies were the main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years in a row we could barely sell
the ones that I was putting out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were culling probably 65, 70 percent of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because I couldn't kill the thrips
and I had every chemical at my disposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was spraying everything that I could,
rotating, bringing the chemical reps out,
[SPEAKER_01]: buying more stuff, throwing more and more
plants away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just I happened to be at one of
Suzanne's talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time I saw her talk out
west.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen her talk in Florida and she was
just talking thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said you know I'm going to give this
a go on that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a smaller crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got permission to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first season that I implemented
biocontrol three ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing predatory mites in the
canopy, predatory mites in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and aureus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't using banker plants at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We maybe culled 35 percent that year and I
sprayed a lot less and then it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like that was that was I controlled thrips
with bugs instead of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was proof that this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The following season we sprayed that crop
twice and it was with IGRs both times with
[SPEAKER_01]: growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: No hard chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing that nuked my biocontrol program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like if you can grow daisies and
control thrips in them with bugs and very
[SPEAKER_01]: very soft chemistry then to me that was
all the proof that I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I know that was a long-winded
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: No that's I think that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this facility you're in 800,000
square feet is just it's it's massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the challenge of having
multiple varieties of plants in there just
[SPEAKER_00]: increases a lot of the I think the IPM
challenges because you will have plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just going to be like trap plants
for a lot of these insects it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh for sure that's a perfect way to put it
trap plants and you know one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I don't see it practiced as
heavily in cannabis or or hemp as I do in
[SPEAKER_01]: you know horticulture and just general
agriculture a lot of times too especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in tomatoes greenhouse tomatoes you see
what you call crop staging you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like what crop do I want next to this crop
and even if you're growing the same plant
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing all tomatoes you have how
many different cultivars and we know some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these are like trap plants like you
said for pests and then when you scale it
[SPEAKER_01]: out to where you're growing you know how
many different kinds of plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally you learn the hard way you
bring in a new crop that you've never
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of nobody at the nursery has ever
heard of this plant but guess what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow ten twelve thousand square
feet of crop space you know at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: the horticulture and ornamental world a
lot of times there's research out there
[SPEAKER_01]: you can look up at least brace yourself a
little bit for what you need but chances
[SPEAKER_01]: are you're not only are you bringing in
this weird plant you've never heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: you're bringing in six or seven cultivars
of it so absolutely it really changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM game and and in cannabis you see the
different cultivars different strains I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean we definitely see this big time we
see spider mites all over one variety we
[SPEAKER_01]: see you know hemp russet my aphids
preferring varieties and the crop staging
[SPEAKER_01]: was instrumental to scale my biocontrol
out bigger than just my gerber a daisy
[SPEAKER_01]: crop because 800,000 square feet it's not
you know two or three big ranges we had
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three big ranges that were a
hundred thousand square feet or so but
[SPEAKER_01]: this nursery had been built out over the
course of 60 years by the time I got there
[SPEAKER_01]: so piecemealed in a way so we'd have you
know ten greenhouses over here that are
[SPEAKER_01]: each about three thousand square feet give
or take so you know then you could do
[SPEAKER_01]: small then you could stage really
problematic crops in there and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: bomb them and to be frank I wasn't doing
bugs in all of my crops because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow that many plants you will find one
that gets a pest that you just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: control biologically but yeah that's
that's huge and sometimes when we work
[SPEAKER_01]: with these cannabis growers and I like
grit my teeth embrace for the answer when
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask them so how many strains are you
guys growing and I've had some really
[SPEAKER_01]: mind-blowing answers to that hundreds of
strains and it's like do you have any idea
[SPEAKER_00]: if these plants even want to be together
yeah well there's a challenge there so I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a few questions one what we're what
you're talking about with crop staging is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite different than companion planting
now if we're thinking of this from an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cultivation perspective and we have
you know we're paying for electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: we're paying for square footage that we're
lighting up we don't want to dedicate a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of space to non-productive plants or
you know non plants that we can't we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: crop for that for value so what I'm
wondering is you know I've always just
[SPEAKER_00]: said hey if you have a cultivar I don't
care how hot it is if it's just really
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to a particular pest just get
rid of it but have you seen anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully running something like that
as a trap plant maybe in a corner or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in a part of the room where they're
able to kind of monitor or is even like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a scouting plant like hey we know we
if we know if we're gonna get thrips in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room it's gonna go to this particular
cultivar oh you mean using an actual a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain of the crop that they're growing as
a trap plant yeah are there other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah are there other plants that you would
might suggest someone might be able to run
[SPEAKER_00]: as a trap plant or at that point are you
just creating a breeding ground for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular pest if you it's that's a
razor's edge right there and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully and unsuccessfully done trap
planting in the past trap planting is very
[SPEAKER_01]: good for and I'm gonna call it scout
planting indicator planting when I used it
[SPEAKER_01]: in Oregon we had a very large range of
azaleas that was about a hundred and forty
[SPEAKER_01]: four thousand square feet that was the
size of the Cravo that they were in and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was I would say sixty percent of the floor
space was just pot tight azaleas and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really no I mean you you can scout
physically and I did every week when I
[SPEAKER_01]: went through there but also a good way to
scout an easy way is to throw bush beans
[SPEAKER_01]: and there bush beans are huge broad leaves
much bigger than your azalea leaves if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's spider mites in those plants
they're going to go onto those bush beans
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to leave they're going to
leave the azaleas they're going to go on
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bush beans bush beans show spider
mite damage almost immediately so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have one or two spider mites feeding on a
bush bean leaf causing visible damage
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas you would need 20 or 30 of them on
a cannabis leaf to produce the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of visible damage so if you're riding
through an golf cart now again I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a huge Cravo I have encountered very
few indoor grows that are that large that
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they would need at a quick
glance to look over and say hey does that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant have spider mites and then the why I
say it's a razor's edge and how you can
[SPEAKER_01]: fail miserably at it is what you have to
realize is they like that bean plant for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason it's not just that it shows the
damage faster it's giving them I mean most
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites in in commercial biocontrol
production are produced on some bean or
[SPEAKER_01]: another leaf in the greenhouses so you
quickly have a spider mite banker plant if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't get that plant and cycle it out
so then you're also creating more work you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to keep planting new plants to bring
in most indoor to me I've not met one that
[SPEAKER_01]: I really felt like they couldn't dedicate
the time scouting necessary of physically
[SPEAKER_01]: going in and scouting as far as a plant to
pull the bad bugs off of another plant
[SPEAKER_01]: again it's something that I think is has
its place in large greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture not so much in indoor
personally that's my personal thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's it's I know the work associated
with it too it's more than just bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: in this plant and it's going to take care
of your problems like you said now you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to dedicate to a plant that you're
not going to make money on off of you will
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think of an abstract mathematics of
is this saving me on my scouting time is
[SPEAKER_01]: this saving me on my spray or even my bug
budget then yeah that plants worth a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of money and you should take care of it
sometimes it doesn't translate over and
[SPEAKER_01]: the first plant that's going to get
forgotten about is going to be that one
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the one that's going to cause
them the most problems when it's forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: now what if let's take this to an outdoor
grow situation where you're just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in under the sun no greenhouse no light
depth let's say you're in you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt or somewhere like that would you
want to plant in your garden some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential indicator or trap plants
whatever you want to call them as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of monitoring you know because some
of these plants can get huge I assume
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not scouting up on a ladder you
know seven feet higher or even taller in
[SPEAKER_01]: some cases what do you think of that and
that's where that's where this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: shines and that's really where I think
that it belongs personally or like in
[SPEAKER_01]: large greenhouses and stuff but I mean
when you see it when you see it done
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully outdoors we work with a lot
of southern Oregon outdoor growers that
[SPEAKER_01]: are they're doing this that you know they
just learned this from their from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up gardening and and and conventional
farming has been on this for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: with the sustainable approach of you know
planting insectary rose in large crops we
[SPEAKER_01]: have growers that are doing beetle banks
we have growers that like you said some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these they have these amazing these plants
are 16 17 feet tall and yeah you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get up and be able to scout that
plant thoroughly maybe you could scout
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant but you're not going to scout
your whole crop so trap plants indicator
[SPEAKER_01]: plants what people call insectary or
feeder or companion plantings you know
[SPEAKER_01]: alyssum and a lot of people plant dill and
milkweed and stuff that I mean you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: so many natural predators semi-naturally
occurring predators and mainly parasitic
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitoids you know there's so many
little parasitic wasps out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's nobody knows their name except
entomologists that you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing those in in a in an indoor
environment so to me it's not worth all
[SPEAKER_01]: that effort unless you're also getting
that extra push from mother nature yeah we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a beneficial bug mix that we have
made locally for us that we plant along
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside of our greenhouse and has
things like alyssum and dill in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I run that right on the outside of the
greenhouse and with the hope that these
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs are because we raised the sides of
the greenhouse we're not it's not a closed
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse as a way of kind of an
attractant without taking away space from
[SPEAKER_00]: inside my greenhouse that I want to use
for you know growing growing vegetables in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case but it could be it could just as
easily be cannabis yeah and depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what and depending on where you are you
know one of the last work trips that we
[SPEAKER_01]: made before the the covid shutdown one of
our new reps eric and i we were in
[SPEAKER_01]: southern oregon we're visiting these
growers and they don't have any companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plantings they have nothing but cannabis
in several greenhouses but it had been
[SPEAKER_01]: getting they've had a little indian summer
so they're keeping the sides up and we got
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they're freaked out asking us
what these bud worms are that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: and we start scouting and they were surfed
flies they were hovered fly larvae they
[SPEAKER_01]: were good bugs they were eating the aphids
that they had and this these these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: had nothing to draw them in except aphids
so sometimes that's all it takes just
[SPEAKER_00]: opening your windows yeah i think it's
it's interesting from a insect perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences in in approaches when we
talk about something that's open outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and something that's a closed environment
agriculture because you do get so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more diversity in natural predators just
in an outdoor environment that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting indoors so i think it requires a a
different ipm approach i mean would you
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with that or do you have any
thoughts on that oh for sure and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: long run as as we you know i like to say
we're all going to be learning the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry for the next 50 years
how it all pans out as you see more
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity come into uh indoor growing
where i like to say as soon as i know in
[SPEAKER_01]: my head what it's going to look like when
i hear you say indoor grow because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still kind of a roulette wheel as to the
growing style but we definitely see some
[SPEAKER_01]: styles of growing and production pushing
and becoming gaining popularity once you
[SPEAKER_01]: see a more systematic uh traditional i'll
say growth approach i think that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to have it as almost two
different schools you will have indoor ipm
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor and greenhouse ipm because it is
it's it's i mean there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities but there's a lot of
differences and that was one of the key
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges when i first started this job
and started working in cannabis is i
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have a lot of indoor growth i
didn't know indoor growing experience i
[SPEAKER_01]: had visited indoor uh you know hydroponic
lettuce facilities and and a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis spots but um it's a it's a
different animal and that's a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: the challenge that i see with indoor
grower or indoor operations that they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: lose a grower and replace them with
someone with a lot of outdoor or somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: even like me with a bunch of greenhouse
traditional conventional greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and just like some things don't
scale out sometimes they don't scale down
[SPEAKER_01]: to this almost laboratory that you're
growing in so um yeah it's it's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really interesting because i've
always thought of it the other way around
[SPEAKER_00]: as in hiring that guy that ran you know 10
lights in his basement to scale up to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's you know 30 that
definitely goes four feet that that scale
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling that direction is really
challenging you know you get the right
[SPEAKER_00]: person they can they might be able to pull
it off but i hear more horror stories than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything on that i would i would say you
have failure on both sides for different
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons i would think that the guy that
has three lights in a basement in oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: that suddenly finds himself as head grower
of a a 10 acre greenhouse in salinas he
[SPEAKER_01]: fails for obvious reasons he wasn't
qualified he has he doesn't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: crop production on that level the other
side that you'll see is a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: when you do commercial production on a
grand scale these guys scale down to work
[SPEAKER_01]: in an indoor they're still learning
involved i mean there's there's no i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to walk in because of all of my
20 plus years in a greenhouse these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't working with the same kind of
equipment it wasn't the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: control the control of the environment so
it is it's a learning curve and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: guys don't want to do it they don't want
to learn a different way and they realize
[SPEAKER_01]: how different indoor growing actually is
me i've always say if i have another life
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm going to do it just because i didn't
and i would love to learn all the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in it it's not entirely
different it's nothing i'd be afraid to do
[SPEAKER_01]: i just i always say i would not accept a
head grower position i would accept an
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant grower position and then maybe
next year i'll go for head grower i like
[SPEAKER_00]: that i like that so one question i wanted
to touch back on was you had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: working with some outdoor growers what
sorts of insects would you purchase as an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grower now i just did a podcast uh
talking about uh with jp michelle talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you don't want to buy ladybugs i
know you mentioned ladybugs at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning um when you were first getting
into it so we know ladybugs are out um
[SPEAKER_00]: what other things just don't translate to
an outdoor environment so if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grill it's just like don't don't
waste your money on these insects they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to fly away or you're not going
to get as good of control or you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: need them yeah i i would think it's if
anything maybe you may not need them um
[SPEAKER_01]: the the thing is that i like to remind
people is everything that we sell occurs
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally outdoors so in the right setting
they all work outdoors and the the thought
[SPEAKER_01]: of them flying away uh and actually it's
it's great one of the new guys some newer
[SPEAKER_01]: newer guys on our team explained this to
me uh because he has a really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: entomology background it's of a little
explanation of why ladybirds just seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you release them you love it
they're they're attacking aphids and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like good you go home and you come
back and they got half of the job done and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they left or they or they just flew
down and got lost um ladybirds have an
[SPEAKER_01]: instinct to look for a huge abundance food
sources so when they see 10 aphids that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not an abundance they want 50 aphids so
that was a good good way to clear that up
[SPEAKER_01]: for me um now again it's ladybirds show up
on their own i don't want you out there
[SPEAKER_01]: killing them um now having said all of
that like some things are just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more challenging to apply outdoors um if
you don't have a way to mass distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: like the bulk predatory mites um like a
blower or a spreader or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're dealing with several acres it can
be very daunting to be walking around
[SPEAKER_01]: shaking a bottle of mites on each and then
that's when you want growers to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on things that fly um things that
don't have to be released into every plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and then as far as the every plant
releases you get your predatory mites in
[SPEAKER_01]: there with slow release sachets so you're
getting them in you're only having to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it once every four weeks instead of weekly
shaking mites on to you know three four we
[SPEAKER_01]: work with now with hemp opening up some of
these are hundreds of acres in size um i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really feel like many of our bugs
are useless outdoors it just depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: what pest you're dealing with uh nematode
drenches and uh in in the soil can get
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely expensive when you get into
large uh farms so that might be something
[SPEAKER_01]: that a grower would consider but a lot of
times you're not running into fungus gnat
[SPEAKER_01]: issues in an outdoor farm like you are in
an indoor or a greenhouse operation yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: was i was kind of wondering about that
because i've never in my outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: experience which is fairly limited uh to
be fair i've never had issues with fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats they seem to be pretty well
controlled by the environment even even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an outdoor experience is limited
tad it's it's the experience in probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the most fungus gnat prone area in the
country too so it's incredibly wet and
[SPEAKER_01]: gloomy there so uh that's another one that
that was a a nice little kind of eye
[SPEAKER_01]: opener for me about moving to the
northwest because uh you know it rains a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot in uh florida too but not during the
winter so fungus gnats out there are uh up
[SPEAKER_01]: there i should say now because i live in
california but up there are uh they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: different animals well but they're not
really i mean fungus gnats are mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the biggest concern to me in
nursery environments where you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: plants pushing out new roots because
that's where they want to be they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be eating those root tips you know the 16
foot tall plant that's three weeks you
[SPEAKER_01]: know two weeks away from harvest it's not
really going crazy down in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time sure that makes sense though
i think uh fungus gnats are also one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the easier things to control uh physically
with sticky traps and then using you know
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes or nematodes and other other
methods for for controlling them i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: what what's your experience if we're
talking fungus gnats real quickly um one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to keep in mind stickies for fungus
gnats are just going to tell you that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have fungus gnats um there's not much
there's not much control achieved by going
[SPEAKER_01]: after the adults unfortunately um it's
kind of like getting root aphids that are
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the soil but it is good for again
as an indicator to know if you have them
[SPEAKER_01]: or not um but to me i think suzanne is the
one that probably coined the phrase that
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes are the the gateway drug for
biocontrol because even like i said that
[SPEAKER_01]: was the first thing i saw efficacy with
was steinoneumofeltae nematodes drenched
[SPEAKER_01]: into plug trays on you know new cuttings
that had been stuck that were developing
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and it worked better than chemicals
and it was cheaper so that one was a no
[SPEAKER_01]: brainer um you know for larger areas and
once we were going propagating plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: like four or five six inch pots and bigger
you know bigger than plug you know uh 52
[SPEAKER_01]: or 104 cell trays we have a bigger soil
volume we were also starting to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: the stratiolelapse then um not as often in
plug trays but um you know stratiolelapse
[SPEAKER_01]: for people that might not know their
predatory mite they live in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: they're introduced at planting at
transplant um they feed on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same things that the steinoneumofeltae
target uh they work well together as well
[SPEAKER_01]: um in some high pressure areas like when
we would propagate in a six inch seven
[SPEAKER_01]: inch pot um for a couple of weeks after we
did the stratios we're still going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing nematodes in there just because that
plant's vulnerable at that time and um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some crop when you say stratiolelapse
that's the former hypoaspis miles or right
[SPEAKER_00]: correct i want to make sure for people who
may be familiar with the old name like i
[SPEAKER_01]: was and and sometimes i and sometimes i
joke that if you really want a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: info on stratiolelapse you have to google
hypoaspis because there's more research
[SPEAKER_01]: out there under the old taxonomy and and
the same thing happened right around the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time with the delocia delocia
coriaria which is a predatory beetle uh
[SPEAKER_01]: roe beetle that we sell it was a coriaria
before that some companies still sell them
[SPEAKER_01]: as a theta and hypoaspis um we updated the
we updated it but um yeah again a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times if you want info on delocia people
will say you know what do i look up i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like well first off look up a theta not
delocia because i studied a theta for
[SPEAKER_00]: years and years yeah so one question i
have i've always thought that with fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats like uh mass trapping if you have a
really bad infestation because i've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: ones i've had ones frankly when i first
started growing they got out of control um
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i thought catching the adults that
that were coming back down and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: laying the eggs for a new larva was a good
idea or is that or do you find that it
[SPEAKER_01]: just it doesn't make a difference at that
point i wouldn't say again it's not i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm it's like killing the root aphids
above soil you're not definitely not
[SPEAKER_01]: hurting anything you are stopping an aphid
that could relocate and then again
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce and it's nothing that i would
tell growers not to do breaking a life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle again that's why i had that's why i
used three different things against thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: was to interrupt that life cycle um the
only reason that i would say don't maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: don't worry about it is if you if you
follow basically the cookbook of hit them
[SPEAKER_01]: with the strat hit them with the nematodes
hit them with the stratios in my my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion is you're not going to need to
invest in the amount of sticky cards that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes to successfully trap that many
because you're talking probably at least
[SPEAKER_01]: one per plant maybe more so just from a
production just from a production
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint but um certainly i'm not going
to beat anybody up for it if i saw
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody trapping them i'm just going to
say i hope you're doing more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: trapping and uh my thoughts are if you
really aggressively go after fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean yeah there's a reason that she
calls them the gateway drug because once
[SPEAKER_01]: you see how easy those work you're like oh
man i got this i can do this so um but
[SPEAKER_01]: again if i walk into a a grow room or a
greenhouse and a grower's got really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats that are concerning them and
that is and they feel that that's helping
[SPEAKER_01]: them by all means but i want to make sure
you're going into that soil because those
[SPEAKER_01]: are the ones that are the problem those
are the ones that are actively destroying
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants by the time you get nematodes
in there you get your stratios in there
[SPEAKER_01]: those adult fungus gnats are going to come
back to a soil that is not conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: is not welcoming for them that makes sense
that makes sense so you're you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not anti sticky traps you just see
them more at all i wish more growers use
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky traps so if i saw a grower using
more than usual i'm certainly not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get mad at them um i work with big
greenhouses that they don't have any and
[SPEAKER_01]: uh to me that's much more of a concern
than a grower who might be using too many
[SPEAKER_01]: again it's just from a just just solely if
i were to walk into one of my greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: and see a sectional grower doing it i'd
say um uh you know those things aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: free or something uh snarky like that just
that if it's within the budget and and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes i also say like man if it makes
you sleep better you're not hurting
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's for sure well let's
reiterate let's talk a little about sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: traps since since we're on the subject um
in terms of orientation in uh greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to canopy or lighting and then
also in a indoor facility where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed overhead lighting um where do you
put those sticky traps and then how
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently should you be changing those
out i know that's another thing that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers forget to do is they just put
up the trap and then they're not checking
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how quickly populations are
increasing on that trap right and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole purpose of i mean there is some
we used to put stickies near our intake
[SPEAKER_01]: fans we weren't trying to capture anything
we were just trying to see what was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in so that was kind of like we'd put it up
there we might not check it for 10 days
[SPEAKER_01]: but then we check it and it's like oh man
there's cucumber beetle on here so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in from outside so we know that
that's in our crop probably uh but as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as the one in the crop the whole point is
to go back and check it and to log what
[SPEAKER_01]: you found now it depends in a high high
pest pressure like if i put a sticky card
[SPEAKER_01]: out i mean you got to within a week you
need to be back checking it one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another um if you're in a high pressure
and you need to and you need to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: plan within the next week you need to put
a sticky out and check it three days later
[SPEAKER_01]: um now if you check it it's covered in
thrips you need to replace it if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing your due diligence and your regular
monitoring like for instance in my
[SPEAKER_01]: poinsettia crop what i would do i'd put my
stickies out i'd check them every monday
[SPEAKER_01]: this sticky might have five thrips two
white fly and you know three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: little random midges that it picked up so
what you do is you take a sharpie and you
[SPEAKER_01]: circle them or you just put a dot next to
them in some way you indicate them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you write the date on there and then
you put the card back out then that way
[SPEAKER_01]: when you check it a week later and you see
the ones with the dots on them you know
[SPEAKER_01]: not to count those so that's one way that
you can make a sticky last more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: week if if needs be but if you put a
sticky out and you just don't come back
[SPEAKER_01]: for two three months that doesn't tell you
anything it may have trapped some bugs but
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't it's not serving its purpose the
purpose of a sticky card is to come back
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor it that's how you determine your
pest populations that along with other
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting methods i like that i've never
heard of that tip that's that's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool idea uh yeah i like that a lot it's
one way it's just one way you know because
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times they we sell these stickies
in all different sizes and some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are almost as big as a sheet of notebook
paper so you're talking pretty expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: if you toss one of those out once a week
if you're in a citrus grove or something
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're going to be using these so
that's actually where i saw that initially
[SPEAKER_01]: was in florida citrus that the growers
would go and they'd monitor it and they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: pull a sharpie out and circle it and write
the date and then they'd write off and i
[SPEAKER_01]: said you're not going to replace that and
they're like no those are like three
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars a piece and we have you know how
many thousand of them out here so um but
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the uh orientation in the crop a
lot of it is going to have to do with what
[SPEAKER_01]: pest you're monitoring for um and if you
have really tall plants and you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips are an issue you're going to need a
sticky somewhere up in that canopy but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you also are monitoring for fungus gnats
you're going to or possibly potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: root aphid very rarely get onto sticky
traps but sometimes the winged ones will
[SPEAKER_01]: get lost and and end up there then you're
going to want one down in the in the base
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant one of the big mistakes i see
is growers hanging stickies like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot above the canopy oh yeah you see
them up by the lights a lot because they
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's insects are attracted to
light yeah and in some insects are but the
[SPEAKER_01]: insects you need to worry about are
attracted to your plants so that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the sticky card needs to be anything
flying two feet above your plants we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about those once we've got
everything that's flying within the canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: handled and especially with thrips is one
that i see people put the stickies down at
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil or they put them above the plant
it's like you missed the whole point
[SPEAKER_01]: there's got to be a spot thrips aren't
jumping up and flying great distances into
[SPEAKER_01]: the air if you ever seen them fly they're
not really agile flyers they're just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of getting from point a to point b so
they're flying within the canopy um but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah there's no need for stickies the only
time i ever put stickies up high like i
[SPEAKER_01]: said was by our intake fans which was just
early season or uh the greenhouses that i
[SPEAKER_01]: worked at we were surrounded by a lot of
cultivated farmland that was just rotating
[SPEAKER_01]: crops so every time they harvested it was
like okay if we can we're going to close
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouses completely for two days
because it's like the mass exodus of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything coming out of those harvested
crops um obviously when they're harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: in august we can't keep our greenhouses
closed so it's like okay put some stickies
[SPEAKER_01]: up and let's see what's showing up here
what we're going to get um some days you
[SPEAKER_01]: put the sticky up and you come back the
next day and it's black from thrips that
[SPEAKER_01]: came in from them harvesting all the
onions around you i never even thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about that usually i'm thinking about like
pesticidal drift i forget about the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of these agricultural areas will
also be cropping a lot of those insects
[SPEAKER_01]: need to go somewhere yeah we used to stand
out and watch when the when they would
[SPEAKER_01]: come out and start harvesting we could
stand at the end of some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and you would watch the birds
just like swarming down behind these
[SPEAKER_01]: machines and it's like yeah because
they're eating bugs the little bugs that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not eating are coming right over
here to the only other healthy plants they
[SPEAKER_01]: can find which we'd get movements of bugs
that came through that we'd only see for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week by the time i'm like oh god what are
we going to do about these leaf hopper
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gone um that we got some that
decided to stay like huge surges and
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips sometimes so that was a that was a
took a couple years to get on board with
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers around us to kind of keep us
in the loop about things like that so we
[SPEAKER_01]: could at least be ready for it you know
yeah all right you mentioned leaf hoppers
[SPEAKER_00]: i hate leaf hoppers is there anything you
can really do to control leaf hoppers
[SPEAKER_01]: there as far as the things with legs and
wings like what we specialize in um i can
[SPEAKER_01]: only provide anecdotal results for you um
i can show you where certain things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we produce will eat them given the
opportunity um there's also the very
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of you know look at their name leaf
hopper um you got to have something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to catch them too there's
all kinds of bugs that will prey on them
[SPEAKER_01]: um i'm sure that they have their
parasitoids as well man leaf hopper one
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't really have a realistic
solution for not one that's worth in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion not one that's worth you spending
the money you would have to do a mass
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculation with aureus or and lace wing
something that's just a real generalist
[SPEAKER_01]: predator but then it's also got to have
the opportunity to catch it and kill it
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat it um leaf hopper is one that even
sprays it's difficult to control with
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays even when i um when they would
harvest those fields and we would get the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf hopper in our poinsettias of all
things and poinsettias i wasn't doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of biocontrol ends so i could go i
could go heavy they're not a pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: producer um we didn't have a lot of
pushback from the stores about you know
[SPEAKER_01]: bees with poinsettias they're just not
really a a pollen heavy crop i mean even
[SPEAKER_01]: with hard chemistry i could not stop them
and most times it was like i said by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time i was ready to jump off a bridge over
it they were gone um so leaf hopper is
[SPEAKER_01]: something though that this past season we
saw what i would call an increase from all
[SPEAKER_01]: over people dealing with damage from them
before it was we find them in there they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really worry me now it's uh oh hey
these things actually screw up our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: now i don't know that they're doing
economical damage to the plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: long run that in my opinion remains to be
seen so it's not that i tell people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about them but uh most people have
plants that we know or most people have
[SPEAKER_01]: pests that we know for a factor going to
damage their crop that we need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tending to um with leaf hopper honestly i
might try to point in the direction of
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the bio pesticide sprays or
something like that but even then i'm i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to tell you to manage your
expectations yeah you know i when i
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed them on outdoor cannabis plants it
was more just an annoyance than i than the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual amount of damage they never they
didn't seem to like create damage
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce on the plant and then create
more damage to where i noticed it was
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically affecting the health of the
plant i've seen it once i've seen it once
[SPEAKER_01]: what i would call an manifestation of
damage that and and i had one of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: reps with me when we were visiting this
greenhouse and we're just like it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bound to happen eventually i've seen
whiteflies significantly damaging cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: one time i've seen white flying cannabis
20 times easily i've seen damage from it
[SPEAKER_01]: once so most people it's like you're
describing it's an annoyance it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a nobody likes to see these bugs in there
that we know are not uh doing the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: any good but i think the question is how
much damage in the long run leaf miner is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a pest of cannabis i have a
million pictures of leaf miner leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: little bugs bunny trails through cannabis
leaves they don't vector any they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: vector any viruses and they don't damage
the plant enough to interfere with
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis so really and my thought is
they're not a pest that's not an
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant you're not selling it for
the leaves so um you know for the now i
[SPEAKER_01]: consider leaf miner kind of in that same
category or not yeah i would just uh i
[SPEAKER_00]: would just shake the leaves usually i
would just shake the the branches or one
[SPEAKER_00]: time i had the blower out because i was
blowing my driveway and i just went yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: from a distance just kind of blew them off
because it made me feel better even though
[SPEAKER_01]: i knew they would just probably hop right
back on and that's probably and honestly
[SPEAKER_01]: man exactly what you saw them do i mean
you see most insects have a lot of a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of insects i should say have incredible
reaction time and a lot of times i would
[SPEAKER_01]: try to spray them and you just see them
flying off they're flying off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you haven't even got to yet so it's
like unless i'm really hitting this with
[SPEAKER_01]: something nasty and long residuals until
they come back to step on it like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: most soft chemistries you have to hit the
bug to kill it so even when there are
[SPEAKER_01]: spray options for them like they're just
uh yeah they're they're one that i hope
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't establish as a big-time pest
because it's one that we and the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are going to have some homework
to do on
[SPEAKER_00]: all right guys i'm pausing the interview
here and we'll continue with the second
