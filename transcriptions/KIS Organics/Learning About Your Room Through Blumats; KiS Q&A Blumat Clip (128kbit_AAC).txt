[SPEAKER_00]: that process, you're going to learn a lot
about your room just by experimenting and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out when do I put that one
question, you're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I watered these beds to 20 M bar
give, you know, for example, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: on day seven and we're, you know,
at 50, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is the kind of like,
holy smokes this, they don't need that
[SPEAKER_00]: much water or, oh my God, you know,
my room's super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on day four and I'm at 160 like,
whoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that kind of experimentation
that, you know, just the question of when
[SPEAKER_00]: do I put blue mats in and really be a very
powerful learning experience for how your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants interact with their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
