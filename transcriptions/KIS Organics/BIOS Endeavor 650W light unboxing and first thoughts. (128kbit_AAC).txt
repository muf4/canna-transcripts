[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys, Tad here with Kiss
Organics and I'm excited to give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: first look at the new BIOS Endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just open the box and let me get it out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cords are going to be extra separate
accessories when you buy the actual light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take it out and get a look at it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this new light is foldable as you
can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I notice is that it's
really well built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sturdy construction with the
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much lighter than the other BIOS
lights and basically we have everything we
[SPEAKER_00]: need here with a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a dimmer cable and then we have the
power supply which all attached to the
[SPEAKER_00]: back and then the light itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of these things are separate in
the way that you purchase the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it makes it really easy to get exactly
what you need so you're not buying
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted cables or extra parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the power supply has these nice little
clamps that fold out here and this will
[SPEAKER_00]: just clamp right onto the top of the light
and snap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these easy twist on connectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the optional dimmer cable
which I'm not going to install right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light does have these clamps so it
makes it really easy if you want to attach
[SPEAKER_00]: it directly to racking.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can extend out and that'll support
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you can use basically some
hangers, some clip hangers, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go ahead and get this light
plugged in and set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay this is a broad spectrum light with
optimal photosynthesis and coverage for a
[SPEAKER_00]: 4x4 canopy area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have 1150 average PPFD at a
foot from the canopy and 2.7 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per joule photon par efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It delivers a total of 1750 PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can be used indoors in multi-tier
systems and for your veg to flower growth
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use it full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the glass over the diodes which
makes them really easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It protects them from dust and overspray
and will actually improve your efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: over time because of the ability to clean
the glass and keep this clean in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility or in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my favorite thing about this light is
the fact that it's really robustly built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love science.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you guys know and the fact that BIOS is
founded by former NASA scientists I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is really cool and it really shows in the
build quality compared to other lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I think my favorite thing about
BIOS is the customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been wonderful working with them and
knowing that if I have any issues or if I
[SPEAKER_00]: need something right away they get it done
in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the great thing about working with
a small business that's focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering for the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you you you you
