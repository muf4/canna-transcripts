[SPEAKER_00]: So I see folks posting photos all the time
in Facebook groups or on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they send me photos saying,
hey, what's going on in my garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times I can't tell from the
photo what is going on in the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, our cell phones just
don't work well for macro photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been using this Dynolite for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry it on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run you about $200 to $300
delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're depending on the resolution that
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really the gold standard when it
comes to these USB microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an image of an aphid that I took
today just to give you an idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do a comparison because it
all starts with a good identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are like, I don't have $200,
$300 to spend on a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Suzanne Wainwright Evans, my dear
friend, the bug lady, recently recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: to a group for an affordable Wi-Fi digital
microscope, this one from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was $30 for Prime Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give you guys a little
comparison so you could kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: pros and cons because there were
definitely some things I came across with
[SPEAKER_00]: this microscope that I really didn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were some other things that
pretty much blew me away in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really quickly, it's a wireless
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hooks up via a Wi-Fi connection,
which has its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you how that process looks
here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your on-off button here,
LED adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just like a DynoLite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you focus the image that
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a digital zoom
additionally here on the back as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a nice little stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the coolest thing it comes
with is this cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand why DynoLite doesn't
send these covers with their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, really nice feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to keep my DynoLite in the bag in
order to keep dust out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne, I think, even puts like a Ziploc
baggie around it too to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope lens clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come with a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: DynoLite charges extra for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the stand, I don't really use the
stand anyway, but the stand did fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: the DynoLite too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's my charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty standard charging adapter
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes about three hours to charge,
they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long it lasts on a charge,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't used it long enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go ahead and dive into the
microscope itself and then comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: images and talk about the pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I went ahead and stole my wife's
phone and downloaded this Max-C app onto
[SPEAKER_00]: it so I can record and show you what's
going on at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about this phone is it does
require you to connect through Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have to go to my Wi-Fi
settings here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take you to the right location,
but it takes you close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to see the Wi-Fi network that
I need, I actually need to turn the light
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the LED light comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I found is it's pretty good
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, usually pretty quickly here that
Wi-Fi network will show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Max-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're connected to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to the app itself,
now we have an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that's the image of this
cover, which is a really nice feature that
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes with that cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I snap the cover off here, drop it down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see now I'm recording or
magnifying this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a couple things about this in terms of
user ability that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I'm in an outside or in a grow
room, it's kind of nice that I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a cord to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to be right next to my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all really nice features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also over here, you can zoom in
and zoom out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to zoom in, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it goes up to two times there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with the Dynalight, I adjust my
magnification and resolution over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dynalight actually has two levels of
zoom that it will focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one only has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're in focus, you're kind of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit less quality there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if I want to take a video,
I have to click over here on video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's recording a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you can know that is by
looking up here in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not quite as easy as on a
Dynalight either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the resolution I can adjust right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also rotate the image 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can snap photos on here,
or I can snap photos on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either will take a picture of the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can go back to my photos library and
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the Dynalight, you have this
really intuitive button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now yes, I can take photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: directly on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's much easier to just click this
little button here to start a video or
[SPEAKER_00]: start a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that regard, I think the
Dynalight wins as well as in the zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at the actual quality of
this camera and see if this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that will work for folks who just need a
picture of an insect to send off your ID
[SPEAKER_00]: or for scouting in their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really interested in getting
that super high resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's compare the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the video of the Wi-Fi digital
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, the quality is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the AFID itself crawling
around on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went ahead and went with video instead
of a photo because the image quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I compared them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do get a high quality photo or
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it does have this digital zoom
where you can push these buttons on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back to zoom in or out using the digital
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get quite close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get a pretty good image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, I'm pretty happy with the
resolution on this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll save some of the negatives for my
little summary at the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the image is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now compared to the Dynalight here,
which is now on the screen, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dynalight, this is the exact same
leaf, by the way, just a different section
[SPEAKER_00]: with more AFIDs, allows you to have that
second layer of optical zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can zoom in on the cornicle there or now
I can see the head of the AFIDs and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of AFIDs here crawling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you get what you pay for in
terms of the lens quality with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynalight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really, really still happy with it
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's summarize the difference
between these two microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this Dynalight, I'm gonna be paying
more, but the image quality is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have customer service and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna have updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with a good company and I've worked
with them now personally and I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is expensive and you're paying for
that quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this light on Amazon, this microscope,
let's talk about some of the cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you guys the image and again,
it's pretty good, but there are some cons
[SPEAKER_00]: that go along with it too and things need
to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I originally took some images and
I didn't wanna share my wife's photos with
[SPEAKER_00]: the app and I thought I could just share
selected photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't actually take any photos or
videos until I shared all my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was recording photos,
I wasn't recording any photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought I would send those
photos from her phone to either my MacBook
[SPEAKER_00]: or to my phone via AirDrop or email or
even Dropbox and I wasn't able to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't let me share the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll let me share the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I wanna just snap a photo in a grow
room really quickly and send that photo
[SPEAKER_00]: off to someone, I absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I take a video, the only way that I
found I was able to share the video was to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it, add it to my iPhone library on my
computer and then drag and drop it onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the desktop and then take that file and
that file was then shareable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, my wife's phone during all of
this ended up getting stuck with only Siri
[SPEAKER_00]: working and I couldn't even do a reset
until I did a force quit on the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that was related to this
either, but it seemed glitchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't too excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I have both, how often will I be
using this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll lend this one out to friends
and family and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of it is it's really
portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I break it, I'm not gonna be
heartbroken for 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm out in the field and I wanna
snap some quick photos, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need my laptop and everything like
I do with this Dynalight for a setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there are some pros and cons
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I really like taking high
quality photos, I'll probably be using my
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynalight more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a grower, you want something
quick, you're not too concerned about the
[SPEAKER_00]: privacy issues or some of the glitchiness
or necessarily being able to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, this might work great for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in the comment section
there for folks who wanna a direct link to
[SPEAKER_00]: it to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do just full disclosure, I do sell
Dynalights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know nothing about the company that
makes these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something that Suzanne put
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy growing, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, identify your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing before we
take any steps or action in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: application or pesticides or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have to start with a positive
ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
