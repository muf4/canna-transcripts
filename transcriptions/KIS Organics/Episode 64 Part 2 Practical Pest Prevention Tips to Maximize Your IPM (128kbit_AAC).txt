[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is all about pest
management and is the second part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: interview with Kelly Vance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened to the first part,
I'd suggest checking that out first and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn a bit more about Kelly and
his background in horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back, I had this list of
questions and we keep, we kind of been
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've enjoyed our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wanted to talk about your
experience in coming from large greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and production setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what practices did you see that you
were using on the horticulture side that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't really made it into cannabis that
you think should be implemented?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to say, and I will,
I'll go back and I'll just repeat the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: staging just because I believe that all
things, that fundamental things need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: repeated until you get annoyed with them
because at that point it's concreted into
[SPEAKER_02]: your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crop staging is one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to say quarantine, although I am
starting to see more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually really excited to see
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, the grower who was the
absolute best at it that I ever met after
[SPEAKER_02]: two years of practically begging him now
works for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our rep Saul, who I was working
with at the time that he was a large
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse cannabis operation in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a whole greenhouse set up for
quarantine of incoming plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: dip, dipping protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that you guys have talked about
dipping on the show by now and actual
[SPEAKER_02]: quarantine after the fact before any of
these plants go out into any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still see tons of people,
especially this time of year, the early
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of the season, they're bringing
in plant material from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I've had them tell me that,
yeah, I know that I got, I know that I got
[SPEAKER_02]: my Russet mites from XYZ and then the next
year they buy from the same person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And okay, let's pretend they're the only
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still need your plants, but you have
an implemented some kind of a quarantine
[SPEAKER_02]: when you know for a fact that you've had
issues from these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one that I see a lot of, but not
enough of too, when you consider the value
[SPEAKER_02]: of this crop is just general PPE in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what the proper term,
because all of this falls under cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: control in the tired old IPM pyramid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you just don't see any
control of who's working and what area and
[SPEAKER_02]: then moving to other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that sometimes I ask growers to
do a little more than I used to do in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, cause we didn't really,
a lot of this stuff, it wasn't like we had
[SPEAKER_02]: it running like a Swiss watch in my
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had very chaotic days where I would end
up in every greenhouse by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, we had our stock
fuchsia greenhouse, which is, those were
[SPEAKER_02]: our mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not going to go spend all day in
the suburbia, which I know are crawling
[SPEAKER_02]: with spider mites and thrips, and then go
work in the stock fuchsias, but I see
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of people in cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get into an indoor cannabis
grow, I'm sure you've been in enough of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these guys are paying a lot for that
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're trying to use every square foot
for plant canopy as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, unless you are a teeny tiny
little person, it's impossible to walk
[SPEAKER_02]: through one of those rooms without,
I like to say getting to know their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no way you're spending all day
in this room that has spider mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: has aphids, has whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to go work in the
moms for the rest of the day, taking cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That to me is just like a no-brainer,
but it's very frustrating when I see it
[SPEAKER_02]: happening and you see these small
facilities that just keep recycling their
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Justin has a good analogy for this
that I kind of liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks at it like a river.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he always starts at the head of the
river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the area that has the least amount of
pest pressure, like your mother room,
[SPEAKER_00]: in theory should be your cleanest part and
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be the cleanest part of your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the easiest area to control
because you have the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be able to keep that area
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you work your way through and
end, you always end in the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are your oldest,
probably most stressed finishing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going into senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones that are going to
have in theory, the worst amount of bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first thing that when we
visit, whether it's a farm or no matter
[SPEAKER_02]: what the crop is, no matter what the
layout is, the first thing that we ask is,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have any areas that are really
infested?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they say, yeah, we should take me
there last.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we try to stay
on top of is we try to keep our own PPE on
[SPEAKER_02]: us as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times if we show up to a
facility, a lot of times they provide you
[SPEAKER_02]: a Tyvek or at least a lab coat or
something to wear occasionally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even I've done it where even the
growers themselves aren't wearing the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw it on just because I don't want to
be, for one, I might be visiting three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four operations that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for another, I don't want to be two
months from now when you have a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: and you start thinking, yeah, I bet it was
that bug guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He walks around and bugs all day and he
came here and walked around in our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I like to tell growers try to
have, I like the river analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whose was that so I can properly credit
them if I use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Justin, I think you met him at
the biocontrol conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the guy that talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's working with Alec.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I just would add, like for me,
when I go visit these facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll only go to one in a day and I'll make
sure I'm putting on clean clothes,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh out of the laundry, clean shoes,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not going to take, I'm not going
to go walk around my farm and then go
[SPEAKER_00]: visit a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have had to visit two
facilities in one day and I literally did
[SPEAKER_00]: a full clothing change in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially my shoes, not because,
you know, like you said, you just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be a potential vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of places don't, I find don't
have Tyvek suits or PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, frankly, I don't know that
that's a complete solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's part of the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we want to do everything we can to
reduce transmission, but I think every
[SPEAKER_00]: facility should just plan on getting bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan on getting, you're going to have to
deal with root aphids and hemp rest and
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that any facility is immune
from these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better have a plan ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should, I think biocontrols are a
great preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should talk about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you don't have insects now
doesn't mean you shouldn't be using
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the perfect time for biocontrols,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Prevention is the key for us to have
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, it's one of the things that you
have to maybe slightly relearn or at least
[SPEAKER_02]: learn from a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're switching from conventional pest
management into biocontrol is,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is funny though, because I do
recall back to my days of, of doing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of spraying and a lot of the classes,
that we would take when we were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: our CEUs for our applicator license,
you know, they're telling you do
[SPEAKER_02]: preventive sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're even talking about spraying
before you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is kind of a hard thing to get a
grower used to the idea of, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I putting out bugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the challenges of that to me is
a lot of times chemicals only have one
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's the amount that you
mix, whether you have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: thrips or you have a lot of thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times chemicals will have ranges
where you have low rate, high rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I do try to put that into
perspective for growers where the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: concept of having a presence in your crop
to make it unattractive for pests in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first place is what keeps the control when
they do show up because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: outnumbered.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wait until you have a pest problem
to address it, it's all about numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about outnumbering and
overwhelming the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have five or six thrips,
and here's the thing, I have never ever in
[SPEAKER_02]: my life been in a pest free crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had growers tell me they grow
pest free crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never grown a pest free crop in my
entire career.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start out with a fresh new dip,
you need to assume that you didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: thrips eggs that might be in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to assume that you might not have
gotten all the spider mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to assume that you might not have
gotten every last hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So under that theory, there's no such
thing as a pest free crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting started early and preventive
and having these things in place is what
[SPEAKER_02]: prevents the infestation in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some pests, hemp russet mite is
the main one that I use as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a scale of one to 10, with one being
one hemp russet mite in my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse and 10 being, oh my God,
I've closed the doors where out of
[SPEAKER_02]: business, anything past three,
we can't really do much about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, but it's going to cost a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hemp russet mite is the main one that I
use as the example.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, everybody's either had them
or they're at least aware of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that did have them caught them
too late the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually a pretty common thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they saw what it cost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good one to compare it to in the
ornamentals world is in poinsettias,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody talks about whitefly the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the most prominent pest in
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where most of the research goes into.
[SPEAKER_02]: A mite that doesn't get as much coverage
as a lot of other mites is called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lewis mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lewis mite is a pest in poinsettias,
but the problem with Lewis mite in
[SPEAKER_02]: poinsettias, it doesn't show damage until
far long after the feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be attacking these Lewis
mites very, very early before you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have them, before it looks like
you have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: No visual symptoms on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, if you spray that,
if you find it early and you spray it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've now taken some of the sprays
options out that you might need later for
[SPEAKER_02]: whitefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good example right there of
like, you have to go in preventively
[SPEAKER_02]: against this almost non-pest to keep your
pest management program in place down the
[SPEAKER_02]: road for your whitefly, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to highlight something you
said back, because this was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information to me within the last year,
I didn't realize that thrips can lay eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because a plant looks clean,
even with really careful scouting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that quarantine room is super important
because thrips could still show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the, the Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mama basically has almost like a
little knife that she just opens the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: and oviposites in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's, there's, I'm sure that
there are highly skilled entomologists
[SPEAKER_02]: with keen eyes out there that can spot
what thrips eggs inside of a leaf look
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I've never seen it that I can
tell you with certainty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that is on that leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I've seen thrips emerge out of
leaves that looked 100% pest free to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one right there that even
dipping, you know, I love dips and I
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage anybody to get into doing oil
dips.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're bringing in a lot of plant
material that you just don't know why take
[SPEAKER_02]: the chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne is out there spreading the word
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's, it's a lot of info
available now about it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really have no excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still know that you might not have got
thrips eggs that might be inside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thrips are one that get overlooked in
cannabis a lot because they're not seen as
[SPEAKER_02]: as big of a pest as spider mites or aphids
or hemp russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I like to remind people of
thrips vector more pests, more plant
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses than any of those other bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking the chance with the plant virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've, I mean, I think we're all
starting to learn the impact that human
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever seen a plant virus move
through a greenhouse or move through a
[SPEAKER_02]: room, the devastation that that causes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been in a greenhouse situation
where my own negligence at treating thrips
[SPEAKER_02]: in a crop that I've, that I didn't think
they were a problem in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a problem in a crop called coleus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coleus are very colorful, leaved plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of flower production in a
coleus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thrips get on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really damage them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw what I considered significant
thrips damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't asleep at the wheel on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wasn't prioritizing them as a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, they spread INSV and patient
necrotic spot virus through that crop to
[SPEAKER_02]: the tune of about $25,000 worth of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of the season, um, stacked up
plants, wrapped, shrink wrapped in
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic, because you now have to dispose
of them in a different way because they
[SPEAKER_02]: are infected and you have to dispose of
plants that might not be infected,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that was from me not paying
attention to thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thrips eggs in the leaves, and it can
really lead to problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know that there's still a lot of
research and a lot of work being done to
[SPEAKER_02]: research this, uh, this, uh, hop latent
thyroid and cannabis, and the jury's still
[SPEAKER_02]: out on if cannabis gets certain plant
viruses, but why wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would we not assume that thrips that
vector viruses to all these other plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that they would be, that they wouldn't do
the same to this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you, you know, for a while there,
it seemed like every weird, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: display of stuff, leaf damage was being,
uh, called to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back on mosaic virus, but I've never seen
an actual pathology report confirming it
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think talking to Suzanne,
she hadn't seen it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, it's always a buddy's friend that
has the lab results, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one's ever been able to produce
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't seen them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seen it yet either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I had, I had one grow that I worked
with out in Bend, Oregon that they,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, then these guys, it's,
it's, it was such a tragedy because the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time I visited their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told them I'm going to brag about you
guys to every grower I meet from now on
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and guilt trip them for not having
the same setup that you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these guys had their PPE dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a zip up rubber doors between the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had maps in each room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you came in this door, you leave out of
this door.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was like a forced river there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't go back out the way you came
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool guys and very talented,
very smart and look forward to working
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about a month later, the guy
sends me a picture of a plant that looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like it has TMV and said, is this TMV?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very honest with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd only been working with cannabis for
about a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what it would display like
in this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, that plant looked
beautiful two days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, I was out of state
at the time and I said, I can't get out
[SPEAKER_02]: there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can come, you know, like Monday or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they get there, I said,
do me a favor, send me a picture of that
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same plant tomorrow from the same
angle and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somewhere I have those two photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them side by side in one day,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I probably won't ever know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely viral because I've never
seen anything impact a plant that fast,
[SPEAKER_02]: not even spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was, it was just, it looked
exactly like TMV, except it was starting
[SPEAKER_02]: at the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, look, you need to get a test kit
that can test for TMV, INSV, TSWV,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is tomato spotted wilt virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anything you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up connecting them with Agdia,
which is the company that produces the
[SPEAKER_02]: test kits that we always used it for years
in the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these things aren't cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to pay $1,500 to get a box of
them because they don't sell just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of their suspect crops, three tests
and negative for every one of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, they lost about, I don't know,
a hundred plants to whatever was going on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next, sometime when we see each other
again, remind me to show you the photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it looked like TMV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very decisively not TMV,
but there's also lately out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there is the only thing I've ever
seen damaged plants that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, this is an awful,
but yet kind of funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, back in the day we were, when,
uh, I was, I was growing outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with my, my brother and my father,
uh, I had taken a sprayer and filled it
[SPEAKER_00]: with bleach to bleach an old room that we
had been growing in, in, in a giant garage
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse on this property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my dad, without me knowing took
that sprayer and was like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I rinsed it out and then went and sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what it might've been
like neem oil or a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember something out of that
sprayer onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came out the next day and there was
just like necrotic damage on the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and I couldn't figure out what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally over the course of three
days, the entire crop was, was just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like the worst case of botrytis
you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was just, my brother is still mad
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I chalked it up as a learning
experience, but it was, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: these were, this was a lot of plants and
I'm not saying that's what they did,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was, it was, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: My probably biggest time of ruining,
of ruining plants from a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny cause it's actually
something that I find myself talking a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about working in cannabis is the dangers
of a sulfur and oil treatment too close
[SPEAKER_02]: together, which I learned the hard way
with a greenhouse full of African violets,
[SPEAKER_02]: which get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had sulfur burners in there
determined that that wasn't doing enough
[SPEAKER_02]: and did a very light micronized sulfur
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't five or six days later that
an oil spray was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do the oil spray, but I also
didn't communicate with the person who
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and in his defense, he, he was still
learning a lot and he didn't have any idea
[SPEAKER_02]: about the interactions between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cannabis growers have learned the
hard way about going after PM or Russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites with sulfur and oil and doing them
within 10 days of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the plants look probably
about like your, uh, your plants did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got hit with the bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so, it was so rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I did have a, I did have a hemp
Russet question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're jumping around a little bit,
but, uh, I had a, I was on the phone with
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower the other day and he was telling
me that he claims he got hemp Russet from
[SPEAKER_00]: his soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to clarify not kiss soil,
not my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't work with this grower just so I
don't get people freaking out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he claimed that the hemp Russet can
actually propagate in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I thought it was exclusively,
uh, a plant that lived in, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: an insect that lived in the canopy and
exclusive only to cannabis or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what, I mean, I'm open to being
wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Publicly, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're certainly, you're, you're certainly
right about it being exclusive to hemp and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are other area fied mites that
at a glance don't, you wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most entomologists without slide mounting
them would not be able to tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of mites that look a lot
like hemp Russet mites that are not hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the fun little things I play
with in my head sometimes is do we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that they only get hemp Russet mite?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a different one in there too,
a different area fied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but trust me, we all know that one is
as many as you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, they do all of their feeding and
their, uh, their, uh, the lively part of
[SPEAKER_02]: their life on the leaves, on the foliage,
feeding on the canopy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's where the jury's out since I'm
sure you know, and it's been said many
[SPEAKER_02]: times that, you know, a hemp and cannabis
exclusive test is going to have little to
[SPEAKER_02]: no official research done on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the actual university based
studies in the hemp Russet mite are
[SPEAKER_02]: limited to a couple of things that
Colorado States put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they haven't been studied at links to
the level of something like a spider mite
[SPEAKER_02]: where we know a lot about the two spot
spider mite, you know, so where the jury's
[SPEAKER_02]: out is the diapause part of their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So spider mites do diapause into soil or
if they have enough leaf litter,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they can't get to good soil,
if you have enough leaf litter,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, uh, you know, uh, just, just soil
litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had people tell me that they've
had people tell them that, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: they diapause in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is area fied mites, that whole
order of mites is a very, to use the same
[SPEAKER_02]: analogy to before it's like a roulette
wheel, the ones that you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: information on the full life cycle,
it doesn't help because some diapause on
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant itself, which that doesn't make
sense on an annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're diaposing, are they going
down into the soil to diapause?
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only way that this grower would be
getting area fied my hemp Russet mites in
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased soil is if he's purchasing the
soil from an old cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not just going to be naturally
occurring in soil that's being sold and
[SPEAKER_02]: being amended and all of that and sold as
commercial soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there may be some sort of
dormancy period though, where these are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive potentially in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until, until it's kind of like when
people tell me that they've seen hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: Russet mite eggs, they're like,
well, we don't have them, but I know we
[SPEAKER_02]: have them because we found their eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, take a picture and prove that
it's hemp Russet mite eggs and you'll make
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of money off of it because nobody
has a picture of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows what they look like really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they haven't been studied on the
degree that they need to be, which is in a
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory or research greenhouse
university setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until then, unfortunately, people have
a lot of theories, but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, they're just theories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chances of you vectoring hemp
Russet mite in any way, except bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: them in on plants that you bought,
um, is very low in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they can travel on gusts of wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they can get on your clothing and
then rub up against the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can they come in on other pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know for sure, but we know broad
mite do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that I've seen photos of a
citrus Russet mite, which is almost
[SPEAKER_02]: identical to, to a hemp Russet mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They jump off of plants and they can't
fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think they would jump off for
any reason, except to either catch a wind
[SPEAKER_02]: current or maybe catch a ride on a,
who knows on a, uh, broad mitle attached
[SPEAKER_02]: to a white fly and let the white fly take
it to another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but with all of those potentials,
yes, they can do all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 99% of the hemp Russet mite cases
we work with, I tell the people you bought
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you bought these, you bought these
plants that they came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, be aware that you were
killing bugs that you paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a, that's a good way to put
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple more questions for this
podcast and I think I'd like to do just a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate follow-up one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know the thing that you wanted to
talk about was the cannabis aphid and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it's, we've talked it to death this
year and the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just one that I feel like it needs to
be talked to death until growers are
[SPEAKER_02]: terrified of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually stay on top of managing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's save that one and do another
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I did have a couple other
questions that kind of fit with this sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of Q and a podcast that we're doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, one of the things we talked about
was, uh, and because of Suzanne,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell folks to work directly with
an insect or go to an insectary to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you're getting, you know,
not only just good information,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as well as fresh bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you talk a little bit about that
process or what your thoughts on are on
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, and for sure, you know,
when I used to buy a lot of bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy through resellers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then occasionally when I was lucky and
working directly with, uh, manufacturers
[SPEAKER_02]: now as times change, we do change our
business approach sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, I mean, we have a really
deadly smart, good team of guys here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's four of us and, um,
we can't really get out and, and visit
[SPEAKER_02]: growers all around the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we do work with some distributors
that usually are a larger ag distributors
[SPEAKER_02]: that are selling products that growers are
already buying already need.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they're already set up with
accounts with these companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: providing stuff like the conventional
stuff that they will use, fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, soil irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but one thing that we do is we try to,
at least with these larger companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're working with, we're doing drop
shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a grower works with this rep who
it may not this rep that they're working
[SPEAKER_02]: with may not work for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're providing our bugs directly from
our company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they, we ship them from our
facility in Redding, California to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no middle man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're coming to you absolutely as
fresh as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most times within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and also we try to work with these
distributors that are open to having us
[SPEAKER_02]: come out and visit their growers with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we make time to visit sometimes it's,
you know, we have ones that are working
[SPEAKER_02]: with growers in Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we visit out there, we'll link up
with these reps that are selling them our
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs and these other products and say,
Hey, let's go visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and so, so that way the grower still
gets direct access to our specialists.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have our contact info.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can reach out to us for technical
support and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of times we have other,
we do have a few other sellers that there
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of a middle man person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they do keep a separation between us
and their customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, most times companies like that are
going to be a lot more knowledgeable in
[SPEAKER_02]: bio control than say some of the bigger ag
companies, because you have a rep who's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much selling everything versus a
rep who's dedicated to bio control.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, those companies may not want a
direct relationship with suppliers and
[SPEAKER_02]: their customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of cut off from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is kind of at the end of the day,
I just want you to buy our bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, I want, I want to, as,
as many people to get our bugs into their
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses, to their grow rooms or to
their farms as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is kind of the growers decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want access with your reps,
um, with the technical end of what we
[SPEAKER_02]: provide and potential visits to your
location, um, you need to be working with
[SPEAKER_02]: one of these distributors that is getting
it direct from us, that is open to us
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the thing is these reps are
also selling bugs for other producers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and every chance that they're
probably, uh, working with them and
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting, but that, that's, that's how we
can connect with the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's how I'm not going to run our team
of four, just completely ragged,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to work directly with every single
grower that reaches out because it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of support involved in what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key takeaway, I think for people
listening to this podcast is make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs are being shipped direct from
insectaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's just to make sure that
they're as fresh as possible because now
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're, if you're a four by four tent
or, you know, a few lights, you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may only want a hundred, 150 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go with, uh, you know,
someone that's, that's buying the bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: as a middleman and then read, you know,
distributing them, but they may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we only go down so small in
order sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes these, the third party,
uh, that is a good, a good time for them
[SPEAKER_02]: to shine where they do, they can break
things down into smaller units and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in their defense, it's not like these
are just getting shipped to some hot
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse where they're going to sit for
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, most of these resellers have cold
rooms that they're doing all of the open,
[SPEAKER_02]: open and repackaging in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's never coming out of that target
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst case is sometimes you have an
extra day in transit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reality of all of this is,
um, to be perfectly honest, we sell some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that we don't produce some stuff
that, and, and that's the case with every
[SPEAKER_02]: producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let them tell you differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we all buy and sell bugs to each other
at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes we are buying bugs from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are six days in transit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used European bugs for years in my
greenhouses, uh, because B, I wasn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: really producing a lot of greenhouse
products back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: B, I was mainly doing lace wing and trick
a grandma and a few other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but no Aureus, no Cucumeras, nothing like
that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, for many, many years,
everybody successfully did biocontrol with
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs that were six days in transit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that, it's not that extra
transit is going to impact the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you're adding a lot more
chances for something to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we do as much on our end as we
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: These third party resellers are doing as
much as they can by having a cold room,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are totally at the mercy of UPS and
FedEx or whoever's moving those bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the quicker, the less time they have
it, the more comfortable I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you and Suzanne have both taught
classes on how to even evaluate the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are receiving to know that
they're viable, not just alive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually going to go out there and eat
a target pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole nother conversation and
class and probably better done live in
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just real quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it kind of plays into,
and I will make it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to kind of a promotion for BI,
but, um, we have been one thing that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have been working on during this downtime,
which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had developed a series of release
instruction videos in the last year and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half or so, uh, just kind of quick little
minute and a half, two minute long videos
[SPEAKER_02]: on our YouTube channel where growers can
go, if they get a bottle of what XYZ and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, cause we send printed instructions
with them, but a lot of times it's just so
[SPEAKER_02]: much easier to just watch 30 seconds of
somebody actually using it to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I'm supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, one thing that we, we have
recently been adding during this downtime,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the rep Saul that I mentioned earlier,
he's bilingual.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have gone and all of our videos,
we also now have available with Spanish
[SPEAKER_02]: audio over for Spanish speaking,
uh, IPM management, which is something
[SPEAKER_02]: we're running into a lot more often now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, but that plays into now that we've
got pretty much all of our release videos
[SPEAKER_02]: for our bugs done, we're going to move
into the next project is a series of
[SPEAKER_02]: videos on scouting and a series of videos
on QC of incoming bugs of knowing what to
[SPEAKER_02]: look for all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and moving forward now that we have
the gift of the, of a bilingual
[SPEAKER_02]: specialist, all of our videos will debut
in English and Spanish at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put a link on the podcast page to
the YouTube channel so people can check
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what bugs are you most famous for
producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I wanted to cover that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, oh man, I'm probably speaking out of
turn, but I thought I remembered it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Kukumaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the West coast, it's the
fastest, easiest way to get Kukumaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on the West coast of the United
States, um, I don't see a way for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them quicker than us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I would say BI is probably most known
historically because this BI has been
[SPEAKER_02]: around for 35 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not until the last about 12 years
that Cynthia, our owner, expanded it out
[SPEAKER_02]: and she recruited, uh, some people with a
bigger emphasis in greenhouse products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for years, BI has been a huge
producer of, Lacewing is probably what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're known the best for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we, I might be overstating,
but we've got to be one of the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: producers in North America of Lacewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we produce a lot of trichogramma
wasps, which are used to control various
[SPEAKER_02]: mobs, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as what the greenhouse is
using, they use a lot of Lacewing in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, I really fell in love with BI
when I found out about our Aureus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Aureus, Kukumaris, Stratio,
Stratiolelapse, Delocia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have 10 or 12 organisms that we
produce right here in Redding that ship
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, I don't see a way for you
to get them quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no knock against any other company,
just they have to ship in internationally
[SPEAKER_02]: to get them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, you're up in the
Seattle area, of course today's Friday,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's an exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Monday morning you call,
Hey Kelly, I've got a real problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a, I need some Kukumaris bulk and I
need some Kukumaris sachets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the very longest it's going
to take, you're going to have them on
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You call us early enough on Monday,
you might have them on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, uh, yeah, that's, and that's not
even just because you're on the West
[SPEAKER_02]: coast, it could be you're in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's overnight shipping either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get it, once we get it there,
sometimes orders come in late in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get the production and the
shipping at time, at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now, right now things are day-to-day
with the whole COVID situation just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of all the shippers that we do
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, a lot of things I will just kind
of put an asterisk on just as a,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a, you know, just a CYA type of a
situation right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, so far we've had no issues with
deliveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had no issues with our shipments
being impacted, but of course we're living
[SPEAKER_02]: in strange times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when everything's running as normal,
um, yeah, I mean, I ordered Oreos the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time from Beneficial and Secretary
and I got them the next day as I was used
[SPEAKER_02]: to placing orders on Thursday to get my
bugs the following Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's a game changer, you know,
cause a lot of times in a green,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a, in a pest management, um,
situation, if you've been gone for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: days or you just didn't scout that area
good enough and you come in and you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, look at these spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to do something in the next two
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if your bugs, if we can't get bugs to
you in two days at the most, or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if we can't get them to you any
quicker than that, you're going to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you're going to nuke your
biocontrol program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the quicker that you can say,
I need to do something about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get bugs for it and attack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, instead of setting everything
back and starting again, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other insect theories out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, beneficial is obviously a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you come highly recommended
by Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, and there's, there's a ton of
different insect theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a limited amount of insect
theories in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you actually think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I would highlight that there's a
lot of different release methods that all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these insect theories have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably a whole nother
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably better done with the
visuals as well, because there's pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons to all these different released,
you know, sachets and bulk and all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once someone gets on a program
that works for their facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to talk, I have a question for
you around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in theory, you're not having to order
these frantic, you know, orders last
[SPEAKER_00]: minute and need them in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's nice that that's a possibility,
but I know there's someone like Justin
[SPEAKER_00]: has, he has a standard order now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knows exactly when he needs
throughout the month to get these bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, just to maintain his, his
preventative IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, my note on that would be on,
on forums a lot of times, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram, social media, media,
you see a lot of people like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's this bug?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only do you see a ton of
misidentification and misinformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, around bio control advice,
but let's say someone has, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fin they say, Oh, you need, uh,
you need a Phidias or you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, lace wings or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't enough information to get good
bio control success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one thing Suzanne has really
like harped on me for is that that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing she's really drilled into my
head is that, uh, every situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and grow environment is unique
and requires a custom approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you know, these rates vary so
dramatically based on every situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you highlighted there isn't a
standard growing methodology for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would get with some of these
other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you just talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, especially, I'm glad you
used aphid as the example, because aphid
[SPEAKER_02]: is the one that, uh, I tell people,
like, if you ask me one question about
[SPEAKER_02]: your aphids, prepare for 20 out of me
before I give you an answer, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important thing is that what aphid is
it that matters?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if, if we're gonna, if we're
approaching, let's say you're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: situation where you need to use wasps,
it's critical to know which aphid you
[SPEAKER_02]: have, or if you don't know, which a lot of
growers don't, and they don't have a way
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it identified, you know,
in their defense, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Suzanne and, and me and, and I are big
about get your bug ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what it is, get it ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is I've sent bugs off for ID
from my greenhouse and, and to my
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacologist have work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get an ID about five weeks later,
uh, four and a half weeks after you
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayed, cause you had to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it is important to know which
aphid you have, um, with thrips too.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I, I, it's a bad habit that
a lot of us have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just say thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say Western flower thrips because
what's true for Western flower thrips
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't always true for chili thrips or
onion thrips or greenhouse thrips or
[SPEAKER_02]: Echino thrips or Cuban Laurel thrips or
all of the various ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that for one, you need to know
that you're using the right species to
[SPEAKER_02]: attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in the case of like lacewing larva,
that's what I love about lacewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to eat aphids if they have
access to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you in a situation where lacewing
might not be a good approach and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to use wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can release both and know that
you're controlling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you know which aphid you have,
if you know for a fact that you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: green peach aphid, there's no need to
release aphidius ervi, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can release aphidius colmani,
which are not as expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you don't get that aphid ID,
you got to release both.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know that you're covering
your butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another example of, like I said,
maybe you want to use wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now this is, this is, uh, this is
something that I have observed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field quite a lot in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of the guys at work have also
made similar observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a lot of times I like to start with a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not making a scientific statement that
I have, uh, research to show this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just field observations and feedback
from our growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that I'm starting to notice
in cannabis and hemp and not just cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and hemp, any plant that in its late
pubescent stage gets these heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good example in the ornamentals world
would be petunias, um, and, or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just greenhouse tomatoes is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, where if you're familiar with the
lacewing larva with its anatomy,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they, they, they look like little
alligators with six legs, kinda there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of drag their belly on the
ground when they walk and they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not exactly small.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do like to get into tight areas and
feed, but they don't seem to really,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not thrilled about going into
areas of hugely dense trichomes that they
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously have trouble navigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an aphid issue on a plant,
that's a week seven of flower throwing
[SPEAKER_02]: lacewing larva, and it might not be the
right approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you, then it is critical to know
that's not the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then which wasps do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whitefly is another good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whitefly, you need to know which whitefly
to know that you're using the right
[SPEAKER_02]: parasitoid for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody that just comes on a forum and
says, Hey, what do I do about aphids?
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody gives them an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they really didn't ask enough
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, almost any, almost any situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know what stage the plant's in,
what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, uh, if it's, if it's
something like thrips, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important to know, are you a
hydroponic grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you are, then we can't be putting
Stratula laps in the soil that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, uh, uh, forums, uh,
forums and social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to belong to a lot of different
insect ID groups on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got so frustrated because it's
felt like, and it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I tease Suzanne about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She spends 90% of her time online,
just having to go in and just correct all
[SPEAKER_02]: of this bad info.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great that people are out there
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just exhausting for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, at the end of the day,
when there's no research to back up some
[SPEAKER_02]: of this stuff, you get to a point where I
can say everything I just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the next guy can come in and say
something and I can't prove them wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can't prove me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, it's like when you go
on Reddit, looking for an answer to
[SPEAKER_02]: something and you read this long response
and it's like, huh, that guy sounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really making sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's probably the right answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you read the very next one and
you're like, Oh, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one makes sense too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it is a little wild west in that
area, but anybody that says, what do I do
[SPEAKER_02]: for aphids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, just throw ladybugs at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't put enough thought into it and
chances are it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that timing also is
important and application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And environment in terms of your,
your lighting, your humidity, your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperatures can all play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people get a program that's
really customized to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you've mentioned ladybugs a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure, uh, if you're
thinking about buying ladybugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: please go back and listen to the last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a lot of challenges around
these wild harvested ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, um, I hope people aren't purchasing
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some in sector reared
ladybugs, but it's really rare and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not what 99% of the population is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most times, and they're not the ones
you're going to be buying at a grow shop
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the sector reared lady beetles are not
the traditional ones that most people
[SPEAKER_02]: think of when they say ladybug.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are ones that are specialized for
going after different pests like mealy
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs, or, um, even one, there is one that
goes after spider mites, but, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: not the ones that you're buying at a grow
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those, as you said, wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things that if there's
something to get up on a soap box about
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's my soap box thing that
I get up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, look, ladybugs showing up on
their own are your friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to, you don't need to
worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not hurting anybody by letting them
come and hang out in your garden or on
[SPEAKER_02]: your crop, but buying them is just,
it's kind of spitting in the face of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it's taking them out of
where, taking them out of where we need
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to clarify that just to make
sure growers weren't buying any,
[SPEAKER_00]: any ladybirds or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to scream at you for it,
but I might wag my finger at you a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one other thing I wanted to cover
real quick was, uh, talking about your
[SPEAKER_00]: staff and how you guys work with a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we just talked about the importance
of a customized approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a little bit that some of
these, uh, some of these distributors will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow, uh, you and your staff to come in
and, you know, maybe even to a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or, or to our facility or work
directly with the grower and coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a program, you're still buying the
bugs through the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not selling direct, but,
um, how do, how do people interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: your staff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's do a quick little bio about the
four people that they may interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: over a beneficiary beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've met them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all great guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's take a moment and plug that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a great team, um,
to, to the, well, I guess three kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of had a hand in getting them on
board here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Greg, Greg Bryant, he lives in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Greg joined up with us, uh,
around summer last year or a year before,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Greg actually came to us from,
uh, uh, one of our competitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had a little bit of experience
already, um, in doing exactly what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And prior to that had experience working
with nematode colonies and did,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, he did work in, uh, efficacy trials
with pesticides and greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a really cool entomology
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we have Seoul Alba who's down
in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Seoul is the one who was, uh,
about 15 minutes into the first time I
[SPEAKER_02]: visited him as a grower, you know,
as a supplier customer relationship,
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him if he'd ever think about
coming to work for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about two years later,
he, he finally took me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Seoul is a licensed PCA in the state
of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got IPM hands-on experience in large
greenhouse cannabis, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and actually he, when I first met him,
he was working in organic herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he's grown, done IPM in mushrooms and,
uh, uh, vineyards and worked in wine
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a really incredible background
of chemical, uh, and, and
[SPEAKER_02]: macro-biological.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the licensed PCA part, not that we
sell insecticides, but it's good to have
[SPEAKER_02]: someone licensed to consult in it because
we can go a little deeper in working with
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that are coming off of
conventional programs and getting them
[SPEAKER_02]: more towards chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little friendlier to what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our most recent addition,
uh, to the team is Eric Vanderslice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives up in the Portland area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Eric was, I knew him as an IPM manager
from another, uh, very large ornamentals
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse operation up there,
very similar to the one that I worked for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the two companies did business
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but prior to that, Eric is one of the
weird ones that he crossed over from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis into ornamentals, not the other
way around because he had, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of years as head grower for a
large cannabis operation in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our team is just full of this diverse
background of experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I just had to do a little
bragging about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the way generally that they'll work
with us, it depends if, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the show that we did in Portland,
where I saw you last, a lot of times we
[SPEAKER_02]: meet people, we get their information
there and we'll reach out to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, get them connected with who they need
to, to get, uh, orders placed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's someone within driving
distance, of course we get out there as
[SPEAKER_02]: soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's someone that's in a different part
of the country, um, that we do have other
[SPEAKER_02]: areas, other stuff that we work at there,
you know, personally, I like to try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a visit to the place as soon as possible
because just like I said, with the release
[SPEAKER_02]: videos, sometimes it takes 30 minutes for
me to explain something that takes 30
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds to show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes I can, I've had growers that
I've worked with for a year or two years
[SPEAKER_02]: and never seen their facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somehow something happens where I
get a chance and you go out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Oh, this is not what I,
it's like when you're reading a book and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you watch the movie and they don't
look anything like you expected them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some growers are really bad at explaining,
and I'm not just blaming the growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some are really bad at explaining what
their greenhouses or their rooms look like
[SPEAKER_02]: or what they don't know their own square
footage a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just me putting eyes on it one time
helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with, with COVID and our travel being
very limited right now, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage more growers to be a little
active in sending us photos that works,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than explaining it to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes just walk around, take about 20
photos of your location, send them to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell me which one is greenhouse a and
greenhouse B or greenhouse 21 and
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way I have in my photos,
I have folders for each of the customers
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've visited that I put the photos in
there from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if, if Tad calls me and he's
got an issue, I can go and see what Tad's
[SPEAKER_02]: a greenhouse looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the sad truth is after four years of
working here, it gets hard to remember a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them, sometimes it's hard to even
wrap my head around how many places I've
[SPEAKER_02]: visited at this point, but the sooner we
can get a visit, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that doesn't work out if we can
get photos and get growers started.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times growers, it's how much they
want to share with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're willing to share stuff like a
production schedule with us, we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: them going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your friend, Justin, where,
okay, we know when you're going to plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're going to harvest, we know when
the plants are switching, when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be transplanted, and we can lay
out some groundwork right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's no such thing as
subscription biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set up certain things like
sachets, releases of stratios,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still, in my opinion, I think it's
like, you got to go to the doctor for a
[SPEAKER_02]: checkup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to check up every now and then and
just touch base.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have certain cultivars that get
a little bit of pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, most of the time we're just
a phone call away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do travel a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes we're unavailable
immediately, but we all will get back with
[SPEAKER_02]: you within 24 hours of an email or text or
phone call coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're constantly tweaking your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never a set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that's always being
adapted to a given, your given situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, you get better at just kind of
knowing what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some things are pretty much set it and
forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can, you can, you can forecast
out nematode drenches or like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: a stratio, lay lapse releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know, you're going to have X amount
of plants, but as far as pest pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: goes, you're not going to have consistent
spider mite pressure throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, consistent thrips pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to, but for a certain amount
of it, it can be set up ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, you know, you,
you go out and you scout, which everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: should be doing, whether you're on a
subscription biocontrol or subscription
[SPEAKER_02]: spray or whatever you're doing,
you need to be scouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You scout and you say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if you're doing really good,
you can reduce what you were going to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need that extra blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you say, oh, well, that new
strain that we have is really getting hit
[SPEAKER_02]: by spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to tack on an extra bottle of
persimilus to push those back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the most part, we're never done
communicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're never going to be done
having pest pest challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we do, we have some growers
that they can't even place an order
[SPEAKER_02]: without calling and talking to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're here for,
you know, to support them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you had your soap box moment
around ladybugs or lady beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to have a quick one around what
you just, what you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I get, I get blurry photos and
videos all the time of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just start off by saying,
I am not going to identify your insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can guess I'm pretty good at
that, but I'm not going to do that for
[SPEAKER_00]: your girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be ethical of me, but I would
happily refer you to someone like Suzanne,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone like Kelly, and they can identify,
but they're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 90% of the images I get are not
high enough resolution to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so invest in something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Suzanne loves dino lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dino light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like they're the only things that
take a good picture because that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years ago though, I gave up on trying to
not sound like I'm marketing dino light
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're, they're, they're so easy
to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many other ones out there that,
but I have bought the other ones and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really a crap shoot of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, and again, I don't get paid by
dino light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Suzanne does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really just are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like dram auto foggers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get paid by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell you what the best one
to use is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do sell dino lights now because of
Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do, I do very small margin,
but I do, I do carry them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, they're, they're, they're
indispensable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, nobody has an excuse to not have
one at this point there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the dino light basic is like
125 bucks at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what is your crop worth to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: One plant is worth, I mean, that's a
fraction of what you make off one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a slide that I do and I'll use
it in a lot of talks just called help me
[SPEAKER_02]: help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use it as a collage of all of the
just atrocious pictures that I've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: sent where it's like, dude, I have no idea
what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell if that's a mite or an aphid
or if it's even a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, but there's someone that will identify
that for you on a forum confidently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a root aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm trying to use COVID as a little
bit of an motivator to people like,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, you know, things, nobody could have
seen this coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we need to take into
account things happen sometimes that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just cannot come out there and see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can't come out and shake your
plants out, and identify your bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to get good pictures to me,
you got to get good at doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and we're open to doing getting on
Skype and, you know, put us on your phone
[SPEAKER_02]: and walk around your room with us where we
can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this right now should be the biggest
reason for people to start communicating,
[SPEAKER_02]: being better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all doing Zoom meetings and
stuff to, to check in and most people are
[SPEAKER_02]: working from home if they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time, times like this,
gear up and have good ways to send us good
[SPEAKER_02]: photos, because the truth is, I've been
looking at bugs for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have, I still have to have an
incredibly clear picture for me to with
[SPEAKER_02]: certainty tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I can with certainty tell you if it's
a thrip or a spider mite, or thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne raked me over the coals for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never thrips, it's thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you if it's a thrips or a
spider mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I can tell you,
yeah, it's western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are rare when I get a photo that
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most times, it's a blurry photo of what
ends up being springtails or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a good soapbox to get up
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe was it you or Suzanne,
who did a talk specifically on that at the
[SPEAKER_02]: biocontrol show about being better at
taking photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was on evaluating products for your
garden, making good production decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of what you need to do in terms
of research and scientific method when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to bring any product into
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my talk, which was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other side I see on my side of the
industry with soil is I'll get a photo of
[SPEAKER_00]: a leaf and they want me to tell them
what's going on, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, whether it's a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you literally can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll come back and I'll need to see a
photo of the entire plant for one so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it's a mobile nutrient,
if it is a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know if there are pest pressure,
what other things you might have foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed, what kind of lighting,
what your environment looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the hydrology process with your
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge thing when it comes to
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil gets blamed for everything in
most cases or nutrient programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be fair, a lot of times it can be
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a lot of these living soil
programs, I'm finding a lot of times it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to the watering or other stuff
that they're doing that they forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where going to the facility,
like you said, you may look over in a
[SPEAKER_00]: corner and see a bottle of something and
be like, oh, are you using that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, yeah, we used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just forgot to put it on the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the kind of things that you
miss from these photos that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something that I,
that would probably be my biggest soapbox
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water management, it really is the
foundation of so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really ripples out to affecting how
effective every other thing you do is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for an instance,
like it's funny because you say the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: gets blamed for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you just can't help the soil
you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to learn how to manage the
soil that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have growers that they got in over their
heads trying to do living soil in very
[SPEAKER_02]: shallow raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they have gone a little overboard
and they've got this incredibly organic
[SPEAKER_02]: soil that, I mean, they might as well be
growing in compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's a lot of stuff,
a lot of bioactivity in there they hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: accounted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's going on,
the same one, all of their old mulch and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's in there decaying is now just
playing a huge host to isopods,
[SPEAKER_02]: rolly pollies, pill bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually starting to damage
their young plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're feeding on the skin, like
basically girdling these small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they really do need to just,
once they harvest, just change this out,
[SPEAKER_02]: this whole system out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I told them the last harvest
and they still growing in the same spot
[SPEAKER_02]: this year with some of the same problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another thing that has a lot to do
with all of that stuff happening the way
[SPEAKER_02]: it is, is the fact that they overwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underwatering is not, or, you know,
backing off the water is not going to fix
[SPEAKER_02]: that problem, but it's certainly going,
it's not going to make it worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a lot of times we have growers
who get concerned when they see huge
[SPEAKER_02]: abundance of springtails.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, springtails aren't really,
a bad bug, but I like to say springtails
[SPEAKER_02]: are good scouts because springtails like
dead roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I walk past a plant that's just
exploding with springtails, I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: springtails aren't the problem,
but I want to know why so many springtails
[SPEAKER_02]: have something to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells me there's a lot of dead roots
in this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it a soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a root disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have something going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine times out of 10, it's overwatering
because springtails, for one, are you
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I see them a lot in these grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, springtails, if you know a
little bit about them, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: technically, they're not even insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a whole separate group of
arthropods called columbula.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very, they share a common
ancestor, but they're technically not
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at them, you look at their
anatomy, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just certain things don't, don't match up,
you know, totally wingless, very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very primitive compared to an insect when
it comes down to their actual physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main way is insects have very,
very primitive kind of lungs that I like
[SPEAKER_02]: to compare it to like the chambers inside
of like a harmonica or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isopods or a columbula, even less,
they have to diffuse water, oxygen out of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to have, they have to be wet
to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you want to send their numbers
out, they cannot live in dry soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have growers that just keep battling
springtails, not battling them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't, you know, they're saying,
well, why do we have so many of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have any diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're overwatering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't breathe if you take that water
out of there, but they'll blame the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: the blame, you know, the roots or the,
you know, what do I need to spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you need to spray less water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was under the impression that
springtails not only ate at roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but other forms of organic matter as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a soil that has high
levels of compost or you're recycling soil
[SPEAKER_00]: beds with these, you know, uh,
flower rooms, you're going to have root
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs that are just leftover from the
previous grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my, my, my thought on the other
side of this is, well, if we start having
[SPEAKER_00]: wet dry cycles or allow the soil to dry
out too much, then we're reducing our
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient cycling on a microbial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that balance lie?
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the, and you are right about them
being kind of a, a little more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: generalist detrivore that they're going to
feed on other stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concern with it, um, that I have
actually seen this in person and it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like the, the, the pill bugs damaging
these, these plants, usually pill bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck trying to find any information
on control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling pill bugs, um, because all of
everything you're going to find that
[SPEAKER_02]: Reed's going to say they feed on rotting
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't feed on new cannabis plants,
but here they are feeding on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of times when you get an
abundance of something and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have, it has way too much competition for
its preferred food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not, you know, infest a plant
like they're going to, if they were aphids
[SPEAKER_02]: or thrips or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my case, it was a crop of dianthus
of carnations that was just, they're very
[SPEAKER_02]: tricky plant to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you're not careful,
you'll overwater them and people weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: careful and they're pretty much constantly
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my little, I called it the
popcorn because it's like just springtails
[SPEAKER_02]: jumping out of every pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I would pull the roots out to make
sure, you know, that they're, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the damage that, that I assume they
could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lo and behold, we start finding
them feeding on live roots and damaging
[SPEAKER_02]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only because I had,
they're so untended that they're running
[SPEAKER_02]: out of dead roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this place is so abundantly
good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's too many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point you have to back off of
the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you want springtails in your soil,
you know, you want isopods in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them to the point that
they're so hungry that they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start costing you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen the, the roly poly bugs,
uh, girdling plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never, I'd never seen that until
working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things I had never seen
until working in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to poke fun or
anything, but a lot of times growers like
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a lot of growers that are big
into, you know, Korean natural,
[SPEAKER_02]: the K and F growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's one like you can really screw it
up if you don't follow the fundamentals of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can end up with a really funky
soil going on that like you might've just
[SPEAKER_02]: created a whole lot of problems for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I, I, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, there's certain things about no till
growing and, uh, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that I don't believe translate
well to controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you know, I'm a big proponent of
living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, however, don't believe in
using cover crops indoors and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, living mulches or even mulches in
general, because of the, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that you mentioned,
we just don't have the diversity about
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that you see outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for these things to be really
effective, but some people do it
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to say that there's only
one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know them, but, and, and I,
I have, we have a grow that we work with
[SPEAKER_02]: up in Northern Washington, like in the
Northern Okanagan Valley that right when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was starting to kind of almost think like,
God, I hate these, these no-till growers
[SPEAKER_02]: cause they're not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and visited this farm and it's to
this day, I use them as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of the healthiest,
just like most kick-ass farms I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: been to is because these guys are
committed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in biocontrol is very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you commit to it and you see
what it can do, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go in half-hearted and you're
not going to stick to it, it's the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing with something as involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And time and with as much time involved as
building a good no-till environment for
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would assume much like ours,
you have a better chance of succeeding
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have access to people who know
about it and can support you with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil much the same approach, I would
assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, I find that running a
cover crop, just, it creates another crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is challenging indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's potentially going to be another
vector for anything from pathogens to
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these mulches, I think you can
get carried away with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already going to be really high if
you're running a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they, they all are very cool,
sustainable concepts that I a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent believe in when it comes to
agriculture or outdoors, but indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same level of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of no-till, I get this
question a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a blog post on it with my
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all of my, just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I like to mix nutrients into
the soil and disturb the soil when I
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amend a living soil bed, because we are
cropping so rapidly that I want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients down into the rhizosphere
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, if we're using organic amendments
and we're not using mineral salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the.
[SPEAKER_00]: The luxury of that time for that to break
down like I would outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause outdoors, you know, if you're
growing in agricultural lands,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to till you can top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can allow, you can run, you know,
other crops during off crop cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can allow that soil to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these other things,
but if you're trying to bring in your next
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, 24 to 36 hours later into a flower
room, I like to get those nutrients mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get these questions a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to mention them on the end
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you, you got to take into account
you're growing a crop that you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a crop that right out of the gate is just
a very hungry crop that is that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: deliberately trying to give it as much as
possible to produce as healthy of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you said, outdoors, you have all of
these, all of these processes working that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have working indoors that,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with production, I mean, we can do it
as natural and as, as by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: by mother nature's guide as possible,
but I've said this many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no such thing as natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to accept that when we decide to
put in a big mass quantity of a crop that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't just spring up out of the earth on
its own, we have to do some things
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can keep it as close to, you know,
what mother nature's providing us,
[SPEAKER_02]: but mother nature, this spot didn't evolve
over the last million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking that I was going to plant a
cannabis crop here, or even, even a field
[SPEAKER_02]: of corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we can do what was naturally in
place here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can amend the soil naturally,
but we do have to take some steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to ramp up some numbers,
whether it's predators or whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, especially when we're
growing at such an, uh, uh, borderline
[SPEAKER_02]: unrealistic level of quality, you know,
that's, that's it's growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like everybody's trying to
grow orchids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing perfect plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have the nutrition in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that I will never shake from
working in such large environments and
[SPEAKER_02]: with such large crops and working,
selling to box stores is there was an
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasis on uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hanging baskets had to be identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, sometimes plants,
there were no visual flaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't the right shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get, you very early learn the
importance of the assurance of knowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what you're saying, putting those
nutrients back in the soil, knowing that
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, um, you know, in an ornamentals
world, you have to produce little cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: cutter plants that look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to do that without knowing,
okay, I'm putting enough in for this crop
[SPEAKER_02]: at each turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the, the breakdown of these cover
crops, like let's say we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to control the amount of
nitrogen we're getting from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Rezovia and the clover,
the clover that may be, it may be living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so managing nitrogen levels becomes
more challenging, especially as we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to senesce towards the end of its
life cycle as we go to harvest it for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it's, it's additional
variability that personally, I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, even though it sounds really good
and cool and fits with my ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it creates challenges on a
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a small four by four tent
by all means, like I think it was great in
[SPEAKER_00]: those situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about scale, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try our hardest to not become
factory farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but at a certain point you production
dictates the way some things have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it's like I say,
there's always a place for craft growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the reason there's still craft
brewery and there's there's craft brews
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's Budweiser, you know,
um, there is a place for those true
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when, you know, I come from the
background of, uh, for many years,
[SPEAKER_02]: punching a clock and then getting in a
golf cart to drive around my greenhouses
[SPEAKER_02]: because there was no way I could walk them
all and realistically scout them in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you scale out to a certain point,
yeah, you do have to, but still,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as long as you're coming into it
with that approach of doing as much as you
[SPEAKER_02]: can and only only adding what you have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you do add, it's like with
biocontrol, we're just putting in stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're amending soil, you're,
you're, you're amending it with organic
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people that get stuck in no-till
and they refuse to do, uh, make changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a grower who's dealing with some
phylons every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that you don't ever barely ever
hear about some phylons.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like little teeny tiny
centipedes that live down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they're an annual pest every year
in the exact same spot on their farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a huge issue with the roots being
damaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you have to do something
about problems like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, with some phylons, a lot of times
people plant potatoes as a, as a crop to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of get them out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's what they're going to start
doing next season.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this season, they didn't get to it
in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the end of the season, I'll have
some good pictures for you of what they do
[SPEAKER_02]: to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like you and I could talk all
day and I know you have other stuff to
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta get back to helping out with my
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, let's catch up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you taking this much time and
yeah, I could talk about this stuff all
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anytime you want to talk about the,
the foradon, the cannabis aphid,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is one I could probably focus on and
just stay on topic for an entire show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, I'll do a follow-up with you
here on the cannabis aphid, but thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: so much for your time today and you and,
uh, you and your family stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very dated podcast
cause we're talking about this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, hopefully six months a year,
six months a year from now, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't be nearly the impact that we're
all seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, well, man, thank you so much
for having me and I'm sorry it took so
[SPEAKER_02]: long to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but yeah, let's stay in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to hearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks dad.
