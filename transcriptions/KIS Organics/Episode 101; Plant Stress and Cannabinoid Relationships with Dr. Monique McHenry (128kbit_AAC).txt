[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Monique McHenry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monique is a botanist with a background in
plant diversity and evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the director of the University of
Vermont, the Cannabis Science and Medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and Plant Biology Certificate programs,
director of the Medical Cannabis Center
[SPEAKER_00]: for Research and Education, and
co-director of the Cannabis Pharmacology
[SPEAKER_00]: course at the University of Vermont
Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also co-founder of the CASE
Institute, a plant-based pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: research enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. McHenry completed her bachelor's and
master's of science at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and her Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Monique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start off with a little bit of your
background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little about yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my background is in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I am a professor in the
pharmacology department at the Law and
[SPEAKER_02]: Reconciliation of Medicine at the
University of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was one of those interdisciplinary
hires so I could teach about the different
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals found in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how they affect the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am the director of the Medical
Cannabis Center for Research and Education
[SPEAKER_02]: at UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I run a bunch of our educational
programs in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to talk some more about
what you have going on at UVM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we start off with just a real
basic foundation here in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different classes of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, there's three classes of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes people misspeak about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the top level scientists can
interchangeably use the word cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can really mean all three.
[SPEAKER_02]: But specifically, there's endocannabinoids
that are produced and found in the human
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the phyto cannabinoids that are
produced by the plant, hence the phyto in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are produced in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes used for therapeutic
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a cultivator, we're obviously most
interested in phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different types of
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how might we cultivate for best
practice in terms of selecting for not
[SPEAKER_00]: just better yields, but also consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you take a step back and we
think about what phyto cannabinoids are,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're a secondary metabolite that the
plant produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant produces tons of secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondary metabolites are usually
synthesized for specific functions where
[SPEAKER_02]: your primary metabolites are synthesized
for essential functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these secondary metabolites can often
be produced very inconsistently between
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that are genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sometimes due to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we don't know why the plants
produce different chemicals at different
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with phyto cannabinoids,
the research has been going on for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's papers back into the 70s as to why
different climates have plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing different amounts of THC,
Delta 9 THC, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to be that different
stressors sometimes cause the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce more phyto cannabinoid,
especially Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other environments can seem to make
more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant actually produces more,
in this case, biomass being flour of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the chemicals might be at lower
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the percentage of THC per gram might be
lower in those plants in different growing
[SPEAKER_02]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on that with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a sort of a genetic maximum in
terms of the amount of THC a plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore the variance in vegetative
biomass would determine the concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC in the flour?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ted, I mean, I think that's probably
a million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse the cliche there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there has been some hypotheses in the
literature that there is this dilution
[SPEAKER_02]: effect where, yeah, there is a maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether it's a genetic component or
something else in the biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a maximum of what the plant
can produce in terms of particular phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't seem like anybody has
really had solid evidence to say yes to
[SPEAKER_02]: that or no to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's a possibility, but we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a big buzzword lately in the
last year or two has been crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of sort of targeted plant stress
for selecting is a way of increasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, cannabinoid production and THC
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been of the impression that
every real life facility has plant stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still at the point where we want to
reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do we know enough from a research
perspective to really figure out like what
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers really work across the wide range
of genetics that we see in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can I can give you some
literature out, you know, that's out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in the 70s, actually specifically
in 1975, Kaufman and Gentner, these two
[SPEAKER_02]: authors published a report and they found
that low magnesium increases the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC and CBD content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think, you know, a lot of
cultivators out there right now play with
[SPEAKER_02]: their calcium and magnesium ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is published literature out there
that suggests you lower the magnesium,
[SPEAKER_02]: you increase the THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have been shown to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, increase the amount of THC is UVB
radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the 80s, a paper by Linden and
colleagues that that plants with higher
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of UVB radiation had higher amounts
of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can go to recent papers like I
think I've actually had a podcast with
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a graduate student up in Canada and
he has a lot of work published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so his stuff from 2018 where he
intentionally applied drought stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he found that that if you increase
intentional drought seven weeks into
[SPEAKER_02]: reproductive age, you have these major
phyto cannabinoids with THC again
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did have I had Darren Kaplan on the
show a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to see the new research
that's that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the more common
practices that I've seen are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more more extreme pruning, removing all of
the the fan leaves and also targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: drought or nutrient stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some sort of osmotic shock
towards the very end near closer to a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest date, maybe anywhere from a week
out from harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any research on on either of
those topics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intentional drought was the cat was
that Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen any published
literature on selective pruning yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't want to doubt that it's that
it's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done anything like that at UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've definitely done you know,
played with amount of nitrogen and found
[SPEAKER_02]: just Kaplan again during his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did another study on changing the amount
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a sweet spot where you get,
you know, a maximum biomass yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: highest percentage of of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he published that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And UVM has put out reports on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nutrients are key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the work we did at UVM showed
that, you know, if you if you add too much
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, kind of premixed bottle made
nutrients, sometimes it's just leaching
[SPEAKER_02]: right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We checked our runoff and we found,
well, that was pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do increase the biomass of the
plants, but you see that dilution effect
[SPEAKER_02]: with THC where you don't have the same
percentage of THC per gram that you would
[SPEAKER_02]: have in plants that are actually producing
less biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had two genetically identical
plants and one produced significantly more
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass than the other under, you know,
slightly different nutrient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw that with THC, with CBD,
it was a little bit more consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like when we applied some
stresses to the plant or change the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, the nutrient regime with CBD,
we can see that dilution effect as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, genetically identical plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were clones of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with THC, we definitely saw that,
you know, you hit a point where you seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of maximize the amount of THC the
plant would produce, even though it would
[SPEAKER_02]: produce more plant matter in dried
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with CBD, we didn't we didn't quite
see that in a couple of years of trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a published accessible paper or is
this one that has not been published yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the CBD that work, you can find
it's Dr. Heather Darby writes reports
[SPEAKER_02]: every year and she puts them up on the
industrial hemp website at the UVM through
[SPEAKER_02]: UVM extension program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see the results of,
you know, the different nutrient gradients
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as everything I mentioned there
for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: For THC, that work isn't published because
it was done in conjunction with a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It couldn't be done at at UVM because of
the legality issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can you talk to me a little bit
about the UVM program and what sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: offerings you guys have as well as some of
the research that you're currently doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to mention there was one other
thing, hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want to get into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are also, I think, applying
jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there has been a paper recently
published by Epiccola and colleagues in
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just last year and and that they show
that jasmonic acid, so J.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: as a lot of people know it as after two
weeks can increase the amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another I think that's another
thing some cultivators have been doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: using these plant morphogenes or plant
hormones applied to different stages of
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering to see what changes the amounts
of phyto cannabinoids there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sorry for that interruption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'd love to talk about the UVM
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we talk a little more about the
hormones while we're on the topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because we have plenty of time
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really I actually just saw
an interesting paper on triacontinol from
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty twenty by I'm going to mispronounce
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shia still Islam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to him directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the challenges is since he's
not working in cannabis and he's in
[SPEAKER_00]: another country, it's sometimes hard to
get those folks to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what what's sort of research are you
seeing around plant growth hormones or
[SPEAKER_00]: what sort of maybe speculation do you have
of what might work well with cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if I think about the plant's
reaction to, you know, different plant
[SPEAKER_02]: morphogenes or wounding, so like you said,
selective pruning, there's usually a spike
[SPEAKER_02]: in calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that's almost a stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a calcium spike in
plants, just like you can have in humans
[SPEAKER_02]: as a stress, you know, I would hypothesize
that that that could increase the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't really seen anyone delve
into that science yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that seems to be an
expectation, you know, at at a more
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific level of what is going on
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what hormones would
would cause that reaction in the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jasmine, I ask it seems to,
you know, oxygen is another huge plant
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone or morphogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people like to refer to it as and it's
responsible for cool things like
[SPEAKER_02]: sunflowers turning towards the lights,
you know, it collects in the bending side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps, you know, hormones or
morphogens like that are involved in some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cytokinabinoid inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't seen much in the literature
on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what other hormones,
you know, I would suggest besides the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for folks that I guess as an organic
producer myself, it's hard to find organic
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of a lot of these hormones that
will actually translate into a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available in another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know for a long time I just I would
apply a file for me a meal to myself
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking I was getting triacontinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, from talking to a plant
hormone expert, it sounds like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: quite difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it decomposes rather rapidly unless
applied at high levels like an alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: How as an organic producer might we access
some of these tools or if at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, be the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Ted, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might you might have stumped me at
that one because I was so thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens in the lab, you know,
where we're wearing purple gloves and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're using special hoods with
special flows that aren't worrying about
[SPEAKER_02]: what the chemical would do to us as humans
because we're not ingesting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to grow something
organically, you know, what what would be
[SPEAKER_02]: a good source?
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that and talk to some of the
people at UVM Extension to see what ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: they would have, because I don't know,
because we're we're not necessarily doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these papers that I'm talking about,
these other researchers aren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to translate that into a field
science, I'd have to have to think about
[SPEAKER_02]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, no, that's that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get you an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's sometimes I don't know is the
best answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I know, like, for example,
with jasmonic acid, there's commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go buy jazz spray for roses today
and go spray it on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there other potential risks
associated with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be an off label use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to I don't want people
listening to podcasts to necessarily get
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of themselves and end up in a
situation where they may be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that could be unsafe for
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that a little bit before
we get too far ahead of the on into
[SPEAKER_00]: another topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think that's a great
emphasis point is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people listening to this podcast from
agricultural perspective or even from a
[SPEAKER_02]: production or a medical perspective,
you know, some of the things we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about are done in scientific settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean they should be applied to
something for human consumption.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yes, you know, there are synthetic
cannabinoids out there that people use off
[SPEAKER_02]: label, you know, approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are using off label.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I definitely don't encourage people to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with pesticide applications is,
you know, there's not that many pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis on their label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't want to encourage anyone to
use things off label.
[SPEAKER_02]: What harm could it do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't know because there
haven't been those same kind of studies or
[SPEAKER_02]: if they are there in their infancy,
you know, a couple of years in of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at what point is it safe to
apply certain pesticides to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, it will be inhaled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people say, well,
why can't you just compare it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's a whole can of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we really want to compare it to the
tobacco industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's safe to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard because you can't really
compare cannabis to lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, probably 10 years ago,
we were writing white papers to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: help legislatures determine, you know,
what levels of pesticides are safe and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when can they be applied?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what levels of residues?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, you can suggest what is
known about other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with cannabis, there's not enough
quite known yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you all know, especially people in
different states, every state has its own
[SPEAKER_02]: list of allowable levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's not based on science,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that brings up another question for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've listed some great
research to support some of these ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: and concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a curious grower, I'm always
looking for more information, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where what resources does the average
layman have for, you know, finding
[SPEAKER_00]: information like some of the ones you
listed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go searching for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if I go to Google
Scholar, I can type in magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and THC and get probably like
a ton of different hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any like publications to follow
or anything that you that you really like
[SPEAKER_00]: to use for that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ted, I think you you kind of hit
the, you know, snail on its head there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is the most, you know,
path of least resistance is to look in
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a trick there is to
once you find a publication that's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting, if it's older and look at the
papers that are citing it, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: our public libraries or, you know,
if you're connected at all to any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: research institute or or university,
then you have the availability to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called cross library loan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if your public library doesn't
have that resource electronically,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could ask the librarian, the reference
librarian usually, to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ask for that from a library that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it is a little more
challenging to get access to some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately, a lot of things are open
source now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're still peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they still go through that scientific
rigor, you know, to get up to publication
[SPEAKER_02]: status.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't cost money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unfortunately, the ones that
aren't, you know, it's quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like $35 to download a PDF of an
article that I'm referencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for the for the lay person,
I think Google Scholar is a great start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're looking at the sources
that cite it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Review articles are a treasure,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a scientist that basically
compiles the literature and finds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, everything they can,
publishes it as a review, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little slice for that particular time of
all the past research done, those are
[SPEAKER_02]: those are huge finds, you know,
as well as textbooks, too, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: textbooks that are going to have a
reference list so that you know somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: took the time to actually find if this
information was scientific or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there are some some up and
coming, you know, cultivation books out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that are helping the old kind of
Bibles that people have used in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of any upcoming books.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I thought about as I was
listening to you talk about research is
[SPEAKER_00]: how does one extrapolate research
effectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I realize what happens in the lab
doesn't necessarily translate to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production or, you know,
real life, real life production.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how do we take, you know, say some of
these ideas and translate them into actual
[SPEAKER_00]: production in a way that makes sense
without drawing too many conclusions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, like I did with the
alfalfa and trichontinol would be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see that trichontinol has these
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make this assumption the work wasn't
done on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, what what can we really do
there as from a from a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think there's there's one
way for for the brave people.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any article, you're going to see a
corresponding author and it will have
[SPEAKER_02]: their contact information using an email
address and just ask the author first if
[SPEAKER_02]: they know a different a different way or
how to translate what they did in the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: to the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not you know, you can you can ask the
knowledgeable people at at your local
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic or garden store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they know a particular methodology to
utilize, you know, jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like like we talked about with
cannabis, it is harder because again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll probably be using things off label
and perhaps like you were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, really, the best answer is for
people like you to have these awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasts where you have researchers who
say, oh, yeah, this is exactly how you
[SPEAKER_02]: should do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But or you you you take a class,
you know, there there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis classes out there where like
ours, we bring in subject matter experts
[SPEAKER_02]: who go into detail and you know,
you have question and answer sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's basically getting the
scientists behind a microphone so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: help answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to caution people from
drawing too many inferences from a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: like even just, for example, the Kaplan
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: On drought stress would be an example of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, he got a very
statistically significant response with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very particular cultivar under very
specific conditions that may lead us to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe there's a trend there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's absolutely room for
replication over time with various
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars under various conditions to see
if this is actually the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're still in our infancy in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just hear a lot of people
confidently saying things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation space based off of one paper
or one idea that maybe we need to just
[SPEAKER_00]: take a step back and, you know,
take a little more of a wait and see
[SPEAKER_00]: process as we do more research,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to throw that out there for
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Chad, I would I would
really encourage anyone working for you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, a larger cannabis company to
encourage the company to have a small side
[SPEAKER_02]: R &D room, right, so that you can explore
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, if you had a huge cultivation
facility or field, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: want to blindly apply a stressor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it will affect your yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's what I was saying and what we
were seeing is your yield does go down,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though your percent of THC goes up in
lots of cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it would be great if
everyone had the ability to do a trial run
[SPEAKER_02]: before they applied some of this on their
whole crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in our infancy and people shouldn't
get carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the biggest challenge I see with
facilities is one, they're just swamped
[SPEAKER_00]: with the day to day and two, they don't
always have the tools to apply proper
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific methodology and rigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then understand how to collect that
data in a way that they can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, accurate, statistically
significant, you know, results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's been a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are there are some in-house
researchers in some of these facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: doing amazing work that I've gotten to
talk to over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully more and more of that
information will become available over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every facility should have should
have a little R&D space because we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: continually keep improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's let's switch direction here and
talk a little bit about UVM and your
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about what
you guys have going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know it's been going on for about,
let's see, it's twenty twenty two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least since two thousand and fifty
fifteen, we've been doing educational
[SPEAKER_02]: programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that, there was hemp research
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Darby out of the UVM extension was
leading research mostly in fiber and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: crops for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in 2015, we started we developed
a program and the first program we did was
[SPEAKER_02]: an undergraduate program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a lot a lot more people
than undergraduates take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first cannabis educational
program for cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called medical cannabis and offered
by a medical school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, we had such high interest
in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a you know, it was back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually ran that January.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an in-person sat in a class.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't in front of a computer there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had so many people sign up that we
had to get a bigger classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we we kind of had to do it by
lottery because we were worried that other
[SPEAKER_02]: people would come in and take up those
seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to give a code to have people
come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had, I think, five different of our
local media channels there recording our
[SPEAKER_02]: first class.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was a scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides, I know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Seth Meyers mentioned it late night
television said something like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, UVM is offering a cannabis class.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hilariously, it did start at four
twenty, but it started at four twenty
[SPEAKER_02]: five.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that was that was a good
joke for everyone, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that interest, what we saw is a
lot of professionals took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we offered it later in the
day so that people could take it after
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we decided to develop a couple
programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one we developed was
targeted at medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cannabis science and medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it you could earn continuing medical
education, the CMEs with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I think, close to eight CMEs that
you would earn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the interest in that grew
so much that there was always a wait list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people were not in the
medical profession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people wanted to learn more
about the plant biology aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we developed a cannabis plant
biology professional certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's been filling, especially
because in Vermont, they have an upskill
[SPEAKER_02]: program where the state helps people gain
more professional skills by paying for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of their programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do offer some free webinars,
you know, not nothing as as as impressive
[SPEAKER_02]: as yours, Ted, you know, where you have
people from all over the world talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so sometimes and then there's a
community medical program where we have
[SPEAKER_02]: different professors come in and talk
about their research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with all this activity, like most
universities, we started a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ours is the is the medical center for
cannabis education and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what that does is it helps
researchers work together because we do
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of cannabis research going on
at UVM, both in the College of Medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the College of Agricultural Life
Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm focused on the education
with a little bit of research going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm, you know, to have some
administrative tasks, like directing the
[SPEAKER_02]: programs and the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's it's been really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, boy, I have things changed since
2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last seven years, we've seen an
explosion of cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and as well as laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool regulations changing all over the map
in the US and abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kudos to you guys for kind of
starting this process here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States with your courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware you were the first until I
was reading about it earlier this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me so if I was a cultivator
and I wanted to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, what what would that process
look like through your through your
school?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's there's two, I call them
in-person courses, but we can call them
[SPEAKER_02]: matriculating student courses that,
you know, you have to be a student or you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go through the continuing and
distance education, which is now called
[SPEAKER_02]: PACE program to enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and those those you need to be in
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, the last few years,
they're somewhat offered remotely as the
[SPEAKER_02]: pandemic progresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one is through the Department of Plant
and Soil Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is taught by Scott Lewin and Dr.
Heather Darby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I teach it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some a few courses in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is focused on, you know,
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other is the medical cannabis
course that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's the in-person
pharmacology course focused on the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis on the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we have online so anyone can sign
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we ask that you have a bachelor
degree in science, but we waive that
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement frequently for people that are
willing to make the effort to get up to
[SPEAKER_02]: speed so that they understand the science
enough in the courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people definitely do, you know,
a diverse background.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of, you know, we have
pharmacologists and retired medical
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals as well as lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And business people and even have media
fellows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we give out media scholarships,
each program for members of the media to
[SPEAKER_02]: take the course for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have to contribute after the
course a little bit in that they might
[SPEAKER_02]: come be a guest speaker for the next
course and share what they've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so those courses are wildly accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have run them twice a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the fall and in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, it's basically there are
pre-recorded lectures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's asynchronous, as well as
synchronous live sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you miss them, that's OK,
because they're recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be something that, you know,
we've had people from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand, you know, all over South America
take these courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do get a diverse group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, there's sometimes
there's webinars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of pre-recorded webinars
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have community medical school
programs, but those, again, are in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't think they're remote anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots of ways to get involved
and take these courses at UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nice thing about UVM versus other
programs out there is that we stick to
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in class, we're only presenting peer
reviewed published literature or
[SPEAKER_02]: literature that or research that's ongoing
at UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to not present anecdotal and we try
to discourage you know, students from from
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing their anecdotal knowledge without
saying this is anecdotal knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's the research that's
backing it up, because that's what's so
[SPEAKER_02]: cool is, you know, people do discover
things on their own and they have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's this wealth of knowledge
from people that have been growing for 50
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then nowadays, it seems like some of
the research is really backing up what
[SPEAKER_02]: they've already found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking specifically at the
cultivation one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a professional certificate in
cannabis plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that is that the one that you're
referencing in regards to, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cultivator who wanted to take a take a
course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the best option?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a cultivator wants to take the
course, that's the one I suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if anyone wanted to take the
course, that is the one I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is because that's the
one that dives deep into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eight weeks long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the first week is just history,
business, law and policy, the basics,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go into basic science and then
we deep dive into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a week about cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a week about post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a week about extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a week about how cannabis
affects the human body taught by
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians and pharmacologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of it is focused on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the past, then we would offer our
medical cannabis or clinical modules a la
[SPEAKER_02]: carte.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just in the process of kind of
updating those and we will be offering
[SPEAKER_02]: them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you took cannabis plant biology and
then you thought, oh, I really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: know more how cannabis affects the human
body, you could then go on and take a
[SPEAKER_02]: module called cannabis and the endocrine
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would absolutely say for anyone
interested in cultivation, start with
[SPEAKER_02]: plant biology or anyone in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with plant biology unless you're
specific, you know, and just want to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about how cannabis affects the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're recording this right now in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it starts end of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purely online and an eight week
program with a time commitment of about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 10 hours per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a non-credit professional
certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that, I'm just reading off your
website page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that all sound correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, yep, that is all correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yep, it wraps right before,
you know, the US holiday of Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it runs this fall and then it will
run again next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you mentioned here that
it's fully online evidence based program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds, that sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there, what sort of research so many of
your professors are teaching and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: doing research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a student component to the
research as well or is that, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that work at UVM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it's fully online, you know,
the participants in the program are not
[SPEAKER_02]: actively doing research at UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have had a lot of students
come and tour our glass house facility or
[SPEAKER_02]: our field research, but the student
research component of it is in the second
[SPEAKER_02]: to last week, we turn the educational
component over to the student and they
[SPEAKER_02]: design a presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we utilize a bunch of online platforms
where, you know, students are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: recording themselves doing a presentation
for their peers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people think that is the best
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their, you know, great learning
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have people that are presenting
on laws or business proposals,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of people think up research
projects and some of them actually go on
[SPEAKER_02]: to do them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're getting feedback from our
team of, you know, different subject
[SPEAKER_02]: matter experts on their particular
proposed research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously if they do them,
we want to be involved and hear about each
[SPEAKER_02]: step.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as hands on in person in the
lab, the field or the glass house,
[SPEAKER_02]: this course is not that because it's
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of feedback have you gotten
on the course or any stories of folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: have taken the class and utilize that in
their professional career?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we get, we get pretty good
feedback from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It usually fills every, every session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think people,
people like the learning experience
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people, it's,
it's new to them to learn online like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, become increasingly popular
in the last few years to learn online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and yeah, I mean, we hear,
you know, maybe what I should do is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is tell about some of the people that we
have teaching it because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that in itself is, is the value of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People really enjoy getting exposure to
the different subject matter experts and
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the other members of the
class.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in this, you know,
in this last plant biology program,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had the cultural editor from Rolling
Stones and, you know, a writer for four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, you know, we had,
we had people who hadn't ever planted a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had people that, you know, were well
entrenched in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of, a lot of times,
some of my colleagues in the industry will
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Oh, Monique, do you know so-and-so?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say, Oh yeah, they took my
course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're running, you know,
a cultivation center down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it's such a broad group of
students that enter and participate,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they do afterwards is equally as
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tell me a little bit about the
professors that you work with and in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I, I teach a couple of the lectures
and you know, my background, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really go super into it because I said I'm
a plant biologist, but it's in evolution
[SPEAKER_02]: and diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I teach the taxonomy section and I'm
really into the way cannabis is named.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, you know, love to talk
more about that if we ever had time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Dr. Linda Clumper and she
is our clinical pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the course facilitator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm the director and she's,
she plays more of an instructor role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has a whole team that she works
with out of Cannify that she brings and
[SPEAKER_02]: they are, they're all on the pharmacology
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's been working in cannabis for
cannabis research for maybe 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did her PhD in the Netherlands on
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we bring in a business professor
at UVM, Dr. William Katz Burel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an associate professor and he's,
you know, been working on the medical side
[SPEAKER_02]: of business for about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, you know, he worked with the cannabis
industry for a little while too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have people in agronomy like
Dr. Heather Darby.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an agronomic and soil specialist for
UVM extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's been doing hemp research for,
you know, probably close to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she originally had a DEI schedule one
license to, to work on hemp before it was
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to be studied without a DEA
schedule one license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I connected with you, I actually
had, I was looking through my notes and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had her name listed as someone that I had
wanted to connect with for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've, I've been hearing her name for
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I needed to reach out,
but yeah, I've heard wonderful things
[SPEAKER_00]: about, about the work that, that she's
been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the work she does is with
Scott Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he is a, you know, he does like
applied agricultural research and mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: on biological control of agricultural
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he also teaches with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Dr. John McKay and he's
a, a chemical person.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he had his PhD in organic chemistry
and he worked with the Waters Corporation
[SPEAKER_02]: early on when they were just starting to
do extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's the chief technology officer,
New Bridge Gold Ventures, and he's the
[SPEAKER_02]: founder of Synergistic Technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's very much entrenched in the
cannabis industry, as well as Dr. John
[SPEAKER_02]: McCartland, who is a family medicine
doctor associated with UVM.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he, you know, he wrote a book about
cannabis pests and diseases and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: authored a lot of papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he, he works with us in both
programs, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: With his, he has a master's in plant
sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he, you know, he, he does teach
some of the plant stuff, as well as some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the endocannabinoid stuff, because he
is a medical professional as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we combined that with some local
experts that are in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the director of one of the labs here
in Vermont and the director of cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: of one of the dispensaries who used to be
in Vermont and now is in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe moving to Rhode Island soon,
as many cultivators do, he's making the
[SPEAKER_02]: rounds at different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we blend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a medicinal chemist,
Wolfgang, Dr. Dachman, Dr. Wolfgang
[SPEAKER_02]: Dachman, and a physician scientist,
so M.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ph.D., Dr. Carlos Freeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this is all in the plant
biology program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you, as you just heard, you know,
we have kind of people from, from lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: different aspects, from business to
medical to chemistry to extraction and
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the field at plant soil
scientists and pest management people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a great group, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they're, they're all doing
cannabis research kind of on the side or
[SPEAKER_02]: have some associations with the industry,
as well as some of them have day jobs in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ER at UEM or studying traumatic brain
injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a great, a great group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all passionate about helping
people learn more, especially when you
[SPEAKER_02]: have an understudied topic like cannabis
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a wonderful group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite an extensive background and so
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that it sounds like a great course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing as you were speaking
about your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had two things I thought were
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the taxonomy thing was
interesting and I'd love to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really got me interested was your
background in, in biology and evolution in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils or the, I guess, soil this media
that we're using, what, what the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: calls living soil, but is really probably
better described as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very fertile soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a higher, at least qualitatively,
higher levels of biomass and activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: these, in these living soils than I see in
traditional agricultural soils or even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, traditional soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we reuse that media, we tend to get
better results on the second or third
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume as we're establishing more of a
functional ecosystem, can you talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about, I guess your thoughts on
any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when, when you're talking about
that, so, so here's my little secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also teach in the Galapagos,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can't not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I love the Galapagos islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you were talking, I was thinking of
island evolution Galapagos because yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: when an island emerges, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first life on it is often likens and
then you get some firm establishment,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's kind of what I would say you were
using, you know, the next round is then
[SPEAKER_02]: you start to get more and more diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as the island rises, so at some of
the highest points on the Galapagos
[SPEAKER_02]: islands is where we find the most
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because those points have been
around the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps we can relate that to what you
just said in that, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using a soil less medium and soil
less cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it, it takes a little time
to become established.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you have those pioneers that are
first colonizing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it takes those pioneers to
attract other, you know, I don't know in
[SPEAKER_02]: this case of it's microbes or,
you know, abiotic factors for those to
[SPEAKER_02]: collect, you need the pioneers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that, you know, that would make
perfect sense from an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you probably get to a point that,
you know, your, your medium is not as
[SPEAKER_02]: useful and guessing because some of the
material is used up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that too Ted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my, my bachelor's degree was in
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I love that topic though more on the
cultural side, but evolution I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the people I work with who
also works at a canvas facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ben Higgins got his PhD in functional
ecology, looking at marine systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an area that I think is just so
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbial level at the microbial
level, it's just, there's so much we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, what we find in, in these soils is we
use a large volume of soil, usually in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bed rather than a small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be critical for
establishing the right microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and as well as managing
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see is every cycle,
you know, it's since it's closed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment agriculture, we're,
you know, it's not, we're not getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: same inputs into there as we would say,
agriculturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're removing organic matter
every cycle or removing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are leaving the facility in the
form of the cannabis biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to replace those every cycle,
but we find that we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we are testing the soil and managing
the media appropriately, we can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: this process for multiple years with
multiple cycles per year, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide remanaging pests and managing
fertility correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we don't have to move the media
in and out of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know from an evolutionary
perspective, how microbially that might,
[SPEAKER_00]: may change or may have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest issue we've had to face,
at least that we're aware of is more
[SPEAKER_00]: managing, you know, sodium when the
cultivator doesn't have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a runoff based on the design of their
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a challenge or certainly
certain nutrients can build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we get something awful like a root
knot, nematode, cannabis, avid,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these things, depending on the
facility's ability to manage them can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: real challenge too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around this topic that I think is
interesting is the, the way we would
[SPEAKER_00]: research it, I think is really,
really tough because they're so,
[SPEAKER_00]: it adds such a layer of variability to,
or the number of variables and vectors to
[SPEAKER_00]: what traditional, you know, agronomy would
want to, to do at a research level versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if I can do research like,
you know, Darren Kaplan did with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was using either cocoa core or
pro mix, a fairly inert media and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a much easier experiment for
controlling variables than, using this
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active soil and managing it
cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of a situation where
infield or sorry, you know, actual
[SPEAKER_00]: production doesn't really translate well
to good research conditions for academia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it, well, it depends on the
researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, you know, people that are used to
working in labs would say there's too many
[SPEAKER_02]: variables like you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, there's a, there's also a way
to, to design your experiment to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, embrace the variables instead of
try to pinpoint them one by one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does seem like the cannabis
microbiome is becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some publications about it
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually doing some studies of it
when, in the glass houses at UVM,
[SPEAKER_02]: when COVID shut us down in March,
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually just didn't resume them
because the young man running them moved
[SPEAKER_02]: on to a different position.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but people are studying the
microbiome and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that's going to be completely
correlated to what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause as you're studying the soils and,
you know, thinking of how do you translate
[SPEAKER_02]: that into more specific laboratory
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, the progress
that's being made genetically where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can test your samples that way will help
with it because it will help eliminate
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the gas work and what variables
are affecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can know exactly what's,
what's going on in the, in the,
in the, in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so like I said, I think it
depends on the researcher and that some
[SPEAKER_02]: people would shy away from that,
but other people would, would embrace it
[SPEAKER_02]: with a different experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, I think about this topic a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it would have to be the,
the control is literally just that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what we're calling living soil
or that enriched media rather than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to define every variable within the media
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just have to be sort of the
control for the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things related to
microbiology is in and of itself is the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've saw some research a
while back around how much fluctuation you
[SPEAKER_00]: get in soils from a biological perspective
in terms of bacteria and fungi and that
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, just based on hydrology alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the only variable they were
looking at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many different things in
terms of rhizosphere interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrology, all these things that affect
tilling that affect the biology in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel like it's even possible
for us to really ever fully understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on or make assumptions based
off of the microbiome in our, in our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, you know, I think I'm going
to answer that like a politician.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what you can think is,
I mean, look at grapes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you develop a chore, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as cannabis becomes accepted as
more of an agricultural crop, you,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of trying to pinpoint exactly
what's changing, you know, the production
[SPEAKER_02]: of every secondary metabolite,
you categorize it in some way and you name
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, using some kind of system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is I think you have to create
a system and everyone has to agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to know there's going to be
some inconsistencies, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that changes when you're trying to use
something therapeutically, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, wine is not necessarily
really used therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little bit of inconsistency,
you know, they're still going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to determine the alcohol level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they slap that on the bottle,
but it might not have the same taste that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would expect, but it's not going to
change the way, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's helping somebody therapeutically
because it's not being used that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's two factors,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that if we really truly want to
understand what's going on in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, some of it is going to have to be
done in a very controlled setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we want to think of it as an
agricultural crop and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's used solely
therapeutically, then we have to embrace
[SPEAKER_02]: it and just come up with, you know,
some kind of system that can categorize it
[SPEAKER_02]: like we have with, with wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that to a microbial level,
I know right now that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications around certain bacteria,
for example, as being phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: solubilizing or nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those sort of classes already
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I understand it, a lot of times
it's a, I guess, sort of a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship where it's more than one
microbe working together that creates the
[SPEAKER_00]: sum of something greater than its parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we really begin to classify and
understand what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, I mean, I think we do
need to scale back and look at things
[SPEAKER_02]: one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, you know, people are using
mycorrhizae with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they even colonize the root?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I haven't seen publications that
say, yes, you know, you could say that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you add mycorrhizae to the soil,
that you can get more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you're saying, there's a lot
going on in the soil, so it might not just
[SPEAKER_02]: be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we go really in depth, you know,
and look microscopically at the roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: do we see colonization from mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think for that, you know,
if you, if you really want to science
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you have to, you have to do things,
you know, in a controlled method and
[SPEAKER_02]: answer the very basic questions first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like does mycorrhizae colonize cannabis
roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what about rhizobium?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are there, are there,
are there little sacs developing like they
[SPEAKER_02]: do in fabaceae?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the pea family where you're having
nitrogen-fixing bacteria, probably not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing, but just one-on-one,
like you, like, like we did with all other
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just more and more microbial
products and biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out, targeting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, agriculture in general,
it's, it seems to be the next wave of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IPM options is really the microbial
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm excited to see where it goes,
but it also seems like there's a lot we
[SPEAKER_00]: still don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may be jumping the gun like you're
suggesting on, on some of these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually fairly simple
experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing it again when we were
looking specifically and we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't seeing a ton of colonization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I bring it up of mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, but you know, we kind of,
I can't, that's not published that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hasn't been repeated and
triplicate because when the pandemic shut
[SPEAKER_02]: it down, we just never picked up that
piece of, of research, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a great question, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you compare it, it's a easy
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You plant something that you know is
colonized alongside cannabis, use the same
[SPEAKER_02]: product, look at the roots, stain them
under a microscope and see, is there,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there colonization?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there isn't, then how could you say
that that particular product is the one
[SPEAKER_02]: benefiting cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's a simple experiment and
I don't think it's been done yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a publication, but it could
have popped up recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, you know, we just,
we have publications now on cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know what's going on there at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was very skeptical of
mycorrhizal fungus in cannabis due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: short crop cycle and high P levels in our
soils and some of those, and the rampant
[SPEAKER_00]: use of various trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I spoke to Dr. Yoram Kapulnik,
I had him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a mycorrhizal research out of Israel
and he kind of changed my mind on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I haven't actually seen a lot
of public research, public published
[SPEAKER_00]: research, sorry, on this topic either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I, can you explain a little more about
what you, what you guys found?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were using a commercially available
endo mycorrhizal product, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you weren't getting infection?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I should probably take a
step back on that because again,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like such in its infancy when,
when that, when that research program got
[SPEAKER_02]: shut down, just because, you know,
people stopped coming into the glass
[SPEAKER_02]: houses and we just never took it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, we were applying,
I'd have to go back and look back in my
[SPEAKER_02]: notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my research assistant and he was
applying commercially available products
[SPEAKER_02]: and looking at them under a microscope and
comparing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the plants that he was using as
the control actually don't remember which
[SPEAKER_02]: one he was using as the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, this is something that I
probably shouldn't go into because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, I don't remember enough about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so it was seeming like whatever
product we were using was not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: really be present in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, regardless of the results
of the research, you bring up this
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting point though that,
you know, we do at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can default to available research,
that's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the research doesn't exist,
it's always something we can test
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you don't have the ability to,
you know, stain roots under a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can absolutely trial in, you know,
mycorrhizal fungus in your facility on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your crop and not on others and
see if you get a plant response in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to disease resistance or biomass increases
that make it worthwhile to use it rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than just, you know, blanketly applying
all of these products and assuming that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting a certain result based on a
sales pitch or something, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I agree with you applying the
scientific method is always a good idea
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're trying new products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that people can't always do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but yeah, I mean, I think,
you know, we had talked to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different lighting companies too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were claiming that certain spectra
did this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason research isn't really there
to back it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, using a different wavelength
on the plant definitely has an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we can't definitively say what that
effect is, you know, maybe you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go ahead and switch all your lighting
to a different wavelength.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard because this is,
you know, I feel like with the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry, everything got ahead of
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same with medicinal cannabis used
therapeutically is a lot of anecdotal
[SPEAKER_02]: information was put out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, states were making rules
and regulations and they were having to go
[SPEAKER_02]: off anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't necessarily true when it's when
it's tried and replicated using the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific method.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no scientific rigor or truth
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I know I know we're getting
short on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have time to just talk a little
bit about cannabis taxonomy and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had people on the past talking sort
of about how this idea of indica and
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa are is not accurate and sort of an
outdated terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have time to just shed a little bit
light on on that topic, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a taxonomy perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have time to talk about taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am wishing I, you know, had had
reviewed some of those earlier podcasts to
[SPEAKER_02]: see people's opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say one thing we absolutely teach in
our and all of our programs is that
[SPEAKER_02]: scientifically the species cannabis is
cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, you know, we don't we don't
teach cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We teach about it that, you know,
Lamerick used it when he named the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dr. McPartland actually gives
some taxonomy information he's published
[SPEAKER_02]: in that area as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he he goes into great
detail in one of his publications about
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the problems with those scientific
names that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, you know, it doesn't
seem like anyone has been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: morphologically, genetically or chemically
categorized plants as cannabis indica or
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis sativa in any kind of consistent
fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to use cannabis indica
and sativa in kind of this popular
[SPEAKER_02]: vernacular as it's used right now in
dispensaries, that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, you know, if you look
at the way it's used and you then try to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the chemicals that are found in
those plants, there's nothing that really
[SPEAKER_02]: is categorizing things as indica and
sativa consistently chemically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, morphologically or
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those names should really not be
applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's there's a funny
there's a funny thing we talk about in our
[SPEAKER_02]: classes, because I think Dr. McPartland
pointed it out in one of his publications
[SPEAKER_02]: is that, you know, one cannabis cup has
I'm forgetting the strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say Jack Herrera win as a sativa
and then two years later, it won as an
[SPEAKER_02]: indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's the problem right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and maybe, you know, it's a it's kind
of a placebo effect where somebody thinks
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting something uplifting
because it's sativa and then it makes them
[SPEAKER_02]: feel uplifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there just isn't really a scientific
basis to it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like genetically all these
plants are so mixed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really isn't anything that one could
say is purely one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we for years, you know,
people would say, oh, that plant is a diva
[SPEAKER_00]: based on its growth habit or based on the
the therapeutic effects they may receive
[SPEAKER_00]: from it and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always the assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't until well, frankly,
until I talked to people on this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really learned the difference
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, enough what we're
seeing from a consumer perspective with
[SPEAKER_00]: blind blind research is that folks when,
you know, people are using THC as a
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing decision in terms of higher THC
being better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when consumers, when you take away the
THC percentage and just give them the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis through a double blind study,
the ones that are having the best effects
[SPEAKER_00]: are not the highest THC price.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the products, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping the industry will change its
terminology and come up with something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some longer conversations with
folks way, way smarter on this topic than
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, when when you have an
industry that has this deep roots and some
[SPEAKER_02]: of them aren't based on, you know,
what what Nestian industries are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: based on is oversight and rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have something that's hard to get
rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, I don't know,
you know, I'm not in marketing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea how you would convince
consumers to not want strain names or
[SPEAKER_02]: indica or sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, the truth is, you know,
there's published literature out there
[SPEAKER_02]: where people have tried to separate out
indica and sativa out of dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, for example, and there's no
consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even strain names, you know,
what you're getting at one dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: under one strain name is definitely not
what you're getting at another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it goes back to the growing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you have a genetically identical
plant, but it's grown in different
[SPEAKER_02]: methodologies, even, you know,
say, nutrients, light wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_02]: time of harvest, or even post harvest,
the way it's stored, those can all affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemicals in it and make it that you
have an inconsistent product that's
[SPEAKER_02]: labeled the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem is all is all
you're labeling it is these names.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same thing, because there is
the botanical rules of nomenclature are
[SPEAKER_02]: not being followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, you know, a cold cultivated
plant code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, you know, hemp cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are not there with with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be clear, I think you can tell
apart hemp and marijuana, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our government thinks so too, by by
setting this limit on the amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there does seem to be two groupings of
plants, ones that are high in THC and ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that are low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, clearly, there's all sorts of
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But going back to the indica and sativa
debate, I think that's going to be a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: To ever really truly separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there ever were two different
cannabis species before, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were domesticated, I think it would
be really hard to to undomesticate them at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point and go back to, you know,
their ancestral forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, everything can
hybridize marijuana and hemp can
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridize, you know, every strain can
hybridize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And produce a viable offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the very basic concept of,
you know, the definition of a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the biological species concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can have two organisms mate and
produce a viable offspring, then you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have separate units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, even the use of the term
strain versus cultivar is really just an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of the nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our industry and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, you know, what's become common is not
necessarily what's botanically correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, the correct term would be
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to prove, you know,
consistency with cultivars in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're getting something
that's considered a cultivar and you plant
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you can know what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabis industry is not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this name strain which actually has no,
I don't even know the origin of why we
[SPEAKER_02]: call things strains, but it doesn't seem
there's nothing scientific about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because of things like bacteria,
it probably just was a carryover from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wouldn't it be called a cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not a variety, because it is
it is something that's been cultivated by
[SPEAKER_00]: humans with an intended purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it from a botanical
perspective, but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else would we call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with the genetic diversity we see
across, you know, a given plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll call something a cultivar once it
hits that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of standardization that a cultivar
would require, because that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't you have a you have a species,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd have a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we take corn, for example, like ZMAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're buying a cultivar of
ZMAs, you'll have that half that half
[SPEAKER_02]: parent and it will say like super sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's eventually what cannabis
should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be cannabis sativa with the
cultivar name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, that's what people
would be used to buying in current
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture is a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you plant super sweet and you're not
going to get flour corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get corn on the cob.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you eat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's that's not really
happening with with marijuana right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp, you can definitely import hemp seeds
like finiola, for example, is a cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get what you expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and I think part of that goes back to
following the rules for the botanical
[SPEAKER_02]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ones for cultivars, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then oversight of following
those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been talking for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're you're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you for your time
today on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope folks will check out the
program that you have and I'll include
[SPEAKER_00]: links to all that on the podcast page if
anyone wants to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try and track down what
research I can that you mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put that on there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
