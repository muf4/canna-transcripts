[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's topic is a bit technical,
but important for growers to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you have two plants or 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Cassandra Maffey and
she shares her experience with creating
[SPEAKER_00]: and utilizing standard operating
procedures or SOPs in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassandra is a legacy cannabis cultivator
who specializes in commercial-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: organic living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She honed her cultivation skills in the
early 2000s in Northern California's
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle, then relocated to
Colorado to co-found one of Boulder's
[SPEAKER_00]: first licensed dispensaries in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, she has helped clients across
the country establish successful
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial-scale living soil cannabis
cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with medical, recreational,
and celebrity brands, Cassandra's passion
[SPEAKER_00]: for sustainability and quality has won
numerous cannabis cups and accolades for
[SPEAKER_00]: her teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cassandra was named one of the top 50
women in cannabis by High Times Magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassandra was kind enough to share a
sample SOP as an example on our podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Cassandra, thanks for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really excited to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself to share with listeners,
please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I started out as a cultivator in the
year 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved down to Humboldt County and there
I learned outdoor cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually I moved to Colorado to found
one of the first vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed cannabis dispensaries there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been working in the industry ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I have had a lot of really
enjoyable conversations off air about a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we talked about
that we thought would be a good podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: topic was SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that I think are really
challenging for a lot of facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even having SOPs as a home grower,
I think, or a tent grower could be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach something like that
that can be really daunting for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, so you're absolutely correct
that growers, no matter if you are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in a closet or you're operating a 50,000
square foot facility, just wrapping your
[SPEAKER_01]: head around the processes and the
materials that you need for every single
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, it's really helpful to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helpful to just get organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you know what the tasks are gonna
be ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what materials you're gonna need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not in the middle of trying
to do something and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh crap, I have to go to the store or
order this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can feel really prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another piece to it also is that
if you don't really get that basic
[SPEAKER_01]: foundational calendar process,
this is organized, then it's really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to know when you innovate what it was that
worked for you or didn't work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's really good to start
with a calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wrap, if you look at it like your
SOPs, your standard operating procedures
[SPEAKER_01]: are a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calendar is sort of your skeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to know exactly how long it
takes you to root clones or to germinate
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you wanna know, okay,
like I actually break down veg into three
[SPEAKER_01]: phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know exactly how long those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have different things that I'm gonna
be doing to the plants during that period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also break flour down into
three separate cycles or three phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanna know, well, how long does
it take me to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take me to dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what does trimming look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how long do I need to cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in all, that gives you a great
skeleton to start filling in details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you sort of piqued my interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you break down veg and flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or into three sections and what are those
three sections?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have very special names,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in veg, I mean, there's actually four
because I've got my rooting phase,
[SPEAKER_01]: my veg phase one, veg phase two,
veg phase three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to veg for about eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a really long veg compared to many
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that process, veg phase one,
those are like little, little baby
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings or little baby, baby clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've just been transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really need to make sure that they're
not getting overwatered, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They really, they don't need any
additional nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they do need to be really carefully
inspected for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some basic pruning and training
and some practices that you can do at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg phase two is like really, really
vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to make sure that during that
period of time, if I'm gonna send my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants into flour, I need to make sure
that they're totally healthy and pest free
[SPEAKER_01]: in that veg phase two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we all know, if you send sick
plants into flour, you're never gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: a great result with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really, really focuses on,
that's where the bulk of the IPM happens
[SPEAKER_01]: for me, is that veg phase two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then veg phase three, we're resolving
anything that might happen in veg phase
[SPEAKER_01]: two and doing a lot of pruning and
training to prepare for transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I mean, breaking it down into
what you're focusing on in each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: phases, I think just makes it easier to
know what to prioritize because as
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, we have a million things that
we're thinking about, a million things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we wanna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're like, right, my goal during
this phase of growth is IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're gonna prioritize every
single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I find it helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then flour phase one, again,
I need to do any additional pruning during
[SPEAKER_01]: that phase before pistols emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm making sure that my canopies,
I grow in giant raised soil beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you and a lot of your listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I need to make sure that that
entire canopy is prepared to be productive
[SPEAKER_01]: and filled out and even during that veg
phase one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then veg phase two, we're just making
sure, or excuse me, flour phase two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's really, really vigorous
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm looking for plant health cues,
making sure that there's enough nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, checking for pests and just making
sure that everything's really clean and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that flour phase three is when
we're getting ready for the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that phase, you really, really wanna
check for, particularly if you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, botrytis or outdoors,
checking for any clues that your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: might need to come down a little early or
might be going a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess it's not so much about how
long each phase is, but just having
[SPEAKER_00]: something in your head that syncs up with
your cultivation schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like you said, not everyone
veggies for eight weeks, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you could do the exact same thing on a
shorter timeline, I would assume,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get similar results provided that
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're creating your SOP,
so I'm sorry, I'm all over the place here
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think about the fact that when I
walk into a facility, it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: get distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you don't have a list of things
that you need to accomplish that day or
[SPEAKER_00]: that week, it'd be very easy to forget to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about sort of prioritizing
those things on your SOP as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: building it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's sort of your framework for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the framework, I don't know if you're
familiar with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy
[SPEAKER_01]: of needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's applied to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply it to any living organism at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, obviously, that food, water,
shelter, or environmental stability for
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants is gonna be the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think superseding anything else,
it's helpful to begin the daily
[SPEAKER_01]: walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looking for number one,
is there anything that's come up in
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation like automated watering
system, which is great all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, air conditioning units,
dehumidifiers, all these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly breaking for us because we use
them so, so hard in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each day needs to begin with a daily
walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just determining,
okay, do my plants have enough food and
[SPEAKER_01]: water or are the environmental conditions
acceptable for good food and water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things obviously need to be
addressed first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, I do have, I flesh out the
calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually, I give to my row team a
harvest batch notebook, which fills in
[SPEAKER_01]: every single day, like, okay, so if we're
going to be hand watering, there are these
[SPEAKER_01]: three days that those growers are
scheduled to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they know that if the soil is too
wet, you need to push it to the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have these floating tasks that are
the basics from, again, it's really just
[SPEAKER_01]: providing food, water, shelter for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if an emergency comes up and you
shift around a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things where we know that,
you know, we don't want to be doing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of pruning like in the middle of flower,
for instance, like I've seen that really
[SPEAKER_01]: stress plants out, you know, overall lower
productivity, lower yields, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodites in the worst case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make sure that all of that is
done before really, you know, day 21 is
[SPEAKER_01]: like the last day of flower that I would
allow any significant pruning to be
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's again on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to think about those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so if you break it into chunks,
you know, okay, so, you know, from a
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling or a rooted clone, you're going
to need to transplant it by this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, the roots are going to
start, you know, especially with clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to start tangling and
braiding with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That causes all kinds of problems later
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just put it in your calendar.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in an ideal situation, I would be
transplanting a clone, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: between the 10th and the 12th day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know that's on your calendar,
whether it's a printed calendar or dry
[SPEAKER_01]: erase or on your phone or whatever,
it's there ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know the week before that you're
prepared with all of your materials and
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of wrap your head around,
okay, well, what are the things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: need?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need so many, you know, I transplant
directly into three gallon pots in bed and
[SPEAKER_01]: then go into the raised beds in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know I need X amount of three
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need this much soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've calculated how much soil is going to
be in each pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I'm going to be watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the key that I brew and this is
what I'll be watering in with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the day of that 10th to 12th day,
I have all the materials right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I've got folks helping me,
then I can say, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: trained in the same SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk about it, go over it for just a
couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that whoever's working with you
is empowered to know exactly what that
[SPEAKER_01]: process is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can all just like work
together, bust it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing is you're kind of
using a calendar system with important
[SPEAKER_00]: dates on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it sounds like you're also
referencing some sort of document that has
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more details in it or step-by-step
instructions on some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, essential tasks like
transplanting, watering, scouting,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, so every single process,
every single task that we do in the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: should have its own SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can compile that into your
SOP manual that has, I mean, my SOP manual
[SPEAKER_01]: has like over 350 different singular SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously that's not something that
most growers will ever need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that level of specificity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start doing this for a really
long time or you're leading a pretty large
[SPEAKER_01]: team, you want to make sure that all of
that knowledge is just in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going to draft a singular SOP,
let's say for transplanting, the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I'm going to have on there
would be when it needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that thing, okay, with the clone,
I need to make sure that that is between
[SPEAKER_01]: day 10, 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the materials that I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I list all of the materials that are
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I mean, things like specifying,
okay, so if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting clones, I specify that that
hose needs to be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, that's like,
one of those things where if someone was
[SPEAKER_01]: just reading your SOP, what if they take a
filthy garden hose that's been outside or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something that just hasn't been
cleaned, you know, a bunch, it's had some
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe old water from a nutrient feed in
it, you know, like, who knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like some old kelp water stuck in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hose, we could really mess things
up if the hose isn't clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of your materials and then specify
like anything that might be special about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean scissors are also a good one,
not just any old grubby pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go, okay, step one,
unplug the cloner, you know, evaluate the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an inventory of, you know,
how many plants you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes into, you know, making sure
that the pots are labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we prepare the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the inoculant that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then going into every step of
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can be just a single one-page
document if you're that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into a deep dive to make sure that if
I was across the country, someone could
[SPEAKER_01]: read this and understand like every little
potential pitfall that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: experience while transplanting,
like you open up a bag of soil and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you need to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I say, okay, stop at this phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plug the cloner back in and then go to
this SOP to, you know, rehydrate the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and then return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, yours are pretty extensive from
what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which may or may not be necessary
depending on the type of grow that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have or the facility or your personality,
but it certainly doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think though that having a system
that's replicable, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: so everyone, even if it's just you,
are transplanting the same way and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking through that process,
you may find you can cut steps out or
[SPEAKER_00]: there's things that you were doing that
you didn't need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also if you do it the same every year,
every time, now you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare data sets and say, okay,
well, this cycle I transplant this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the next cycle you transplant a
different way, it's really hard to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of differences and results,
what they're related to, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do really like that aspect of SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that's, you know, I'm sure
that that's something also that your team
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences when doing like any sort of
crop consultation with growers is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can help people who really know what their
baseline is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand what all of their inputs
are, because they know what they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, you know, it's written down to you,
then that makes it a lot easier for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, okay, well, I can see where you maybe
went wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is why we're, you know,
seeing a crazy amount of magnesium pop up
[SPEAKER_01]: in your soil or whatever it is,
you know, or this is what seems like pH
[SPEAKER_01]: has just, you know, plummeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it seems like, gosh,
you've got a lot of nitrogen in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know what that baseline is,
it makes it a lot easier for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you when you run into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that because coming in from
the outside mid cycle and getting a list
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything that's been been added as an
input is really helpful in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 100% agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and then there are, you know,
some additional things, too, that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people forget, you know,
they're that when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments, you know, and, you know,
I think a lot of your listeners and
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly, you know, you and me might
prefer to have the bulk of nutrition be
[SPEAKER_01]: present in the soil from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we get into adding, you know,
liquid feed whether that's mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: teas, even dilute teas have like,
substantial, you know, nutritive content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and oftentimes, like, if you've
gathered a bunch of plants, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: like some horsetail, you know,
this and that, and rose hips and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whoever, you know, who knows
what else, it can be really difficult then
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so like, how do we how do we move in
the right direction if you don't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what what has been in those teas
or those ferments, you know, as additional
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've noticed, like, when I've worked
with various teams, they might give me
[SPEAKER_01]: their feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't even include those teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like an additional just wild
card that hasn't really been accounted
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that it's good for biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, and some people like in the
case of, you know, FPJ, or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, maybe the growers harvesting
different input materials every single
[SPEAKER_01]: time, with really varied results,
well, it's going to be difficult for me or
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, your team, to come in and say,
Okay, I know how that affected everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and half the time, we won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't in the SOPs, if it's not,
referenced directly, it makes it harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you bring up a really
important point in the sense that these a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of teas and ferments do bring in a
level of mineral nutrition that people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're accounting for the total
load of nitrogen, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we think a plant is going to need in
its lifecycle, and then you add a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: teas, well, like you said, that's going to
drop the pH, maybe outside of a range that
[SPEAKER_00]: we want, it's going to provide more
nitrogen rates than we may want the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to have at various stages, and could limit
uptake of other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things have a place and
I'm not against them, but it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to account for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that as you add more of
these things, you are adding more
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you do have a problem,
going back and looking at the 10 different
[SPEAKER_00]: tea applications you made, it's really
hard to determine what was beneficial and
[SPEAKER_00]: what caused problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to start from a baseline
that's very simple, as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm like, hey, just start with
water, get an idea for how the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to perform, and then add from there
one at a time and get an idea of if this
[SPEAKER_00]: is beneficial or not, and then figure out
what the limiting factor of plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that this is actually addressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding calcium and you already
have sufficient calcium, then it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you any favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, wouldn't it be cool to start
out with, okay, even in a small grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could go ahead and do a side-by-side,
essentially using two or three different
[SPEAKER_01]: SOPs at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm going to have the water only
bed here, and I'm going to utilize these
[SPEAKER_01]: teas in the second one, and this in the
third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that idea of starting really
simple and just adding from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it can be so difficult if we
don't write these things down,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we don't collect data from every single
thing we've done through a harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so hard to go back later and know
what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to keep track of that,
even if it's in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to keep track of
when you water, if you're hand watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: what those days are, to track that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may be surprised with how that
ends up, if you're actually tracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you may be surprised with how that
correlates to your plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to also track, like you said,
every application that you're making of
[SPEAKER_00]: any microbial or nutrient or spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Track when you prune, track your scouting,
and keep track of any insect pressures
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of that information is really
helpful over time in figuring out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and how you can improve things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be as high tech or as low tech
as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a bunch of years, a dry erase calendar
was enough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those dry erase calendars that
are three or four months long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, okay, so at the
beginning of my harvest cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, right, so I'm cloning from here
to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's enough room to just write a
couple little notes on that dry erase
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar about what I actually did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one color, I've got what I plan to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another color, I write down what I
actually did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the harvest,
you can just take a picture with your
[SPEAKER_01]: phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be an ultra low tech way of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you've got a question,
like six months later, then you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: pull it up in your phone and be like,
oh, yeah, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what worked or that's what
didn't work, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of tools out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all helpful or necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a balance I've found over with
my business at Kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use Slack, and that works really well
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works well for day-to-day
communication, but it doesn't work well
[SPEAKER_00]: for tracking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I need to follow up with someone two
weeks from now, that's not a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's something I want to look at
and then come back to later, it's not very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a combination of Slack,
either a Google calendar or Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar, some sort of calendar where we
can put things on there that'll send us
[SPEAKER_00]: alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess those are our main
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have SOPs as a separate
document.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it were a grow, I would want
another document to track all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you're talking about,
just putting it into a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to collect data just for
the sake of collecting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have an idea prior to starting
any plans of what I want to collect data
[SPEAKER_00]: for, like what the goals are for that data
so I can make sure that it's usable and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just wasting my time, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, and perhaps a helpful way to
do that is, you know, so you collect all
[SPEAKER_01]: this data during the course of a harvest
batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want ultimately, you know,
at the end, everybody's going to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this was my yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the overall quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are two like super,
super basic things that we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, growers are going to pay
attention to every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're a home grower,
you don't necessarily have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: access to potency testing or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, if you're a commercial
grower, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, at the end of every
harvest, I sit down with my team and I
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know, we review that harvest
batch notebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single thing we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we say, okay, so we have been
tracking the yields of all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains in any given facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I work with a number of
different facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in every single one, we're keeping
data on, you know, this strain and what
[SPEAKER_01]: its average yield is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I say, you know, well,
shoot, like our average yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: like went down, you know, by, you know,
so many grams per square foot this round,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, let's, let's look at why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could say, oh, well, it was just an
environmental thing, because we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: here, okay, the air conditioning broke
from, you know, this time to this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant health suffered, it was documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can evaluate some other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we're also going to track soil
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important,
especially if you're reusing your media to
[SPEAKER_01]: test, you know, I like to send in soil
tests at least, like seven to 10 days
[SPEAKER_01]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of get, this is what the end of
harvest looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I've re-amended,
then I can also send at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: the next batch, I can get a sense for
like, okay, I've re-amended, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what the soil test looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So comparing those, and then if you're
seeing like some sort of anomaly with your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test results, that's another,
you know, hopefully you can catch that
[SPEAKER_01]: before yield is over-effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, if you see an anomaly
in your results, then you can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: look back through your data to understand
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the next question I would have
around SOPs would be, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you didn't have, if you had a
blank page and you were thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: starting this process, where would you
start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely start with that calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then you need to, to just mentally
walk yourself through every single thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do throughout the course of a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you can even start on the
fly, like as you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you've never written anything down
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well with your next harvest batch,
start, you know, okay, so today I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning and these are the things that I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just make sure that you write it
down, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, and it's Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked through, you know, I evaluated
the pH and the, you know, cloner,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I, you know, or I checked for roots on
the peat plug or, you know, whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're just, you just write down
what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it makes it, you know,
really easy for the next time to just look
[SPEAKER_01]: through and be like, okay, so this is
what, you know, this is what my schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just every time you can like add
a little bit of detail here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: something comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's really easy to just
add something in, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do something really simple and
just have it be on a dry erase calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I have a Word document for
mine just because it makes it easy to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, edit, share, and, you know,
just keeps it a little bit more organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I've got a table of contents
that I can just click through exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a chance to read The Lean
Farm by Ben Hartman or any of the lean
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing stuff with Toyota coming out
of Japan?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, yeah, I, I, I've read, you know,
the, well, I've read The Lean Startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, The Lean Farm is, is on my,
my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my list of books to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That book was really great for me because
I was familiar with sort of lean
[SPEAKER_00]: principles, but I couldn't figure out how
it really applied to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ben applying it to a small market farm
really allowed it to click for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did an interview with him years ago
now, and he's got a lot of resources out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but the highlights for me that
really stuck were thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mapping how, like, for example,
if there's a task that I'm doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say transplanting, how many steps am
I taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, moving throughout the facility
to have to get all the materials together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is my, is my soil in one place
and the pots over here, and I'm constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: having to take extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, he makes like a spaghetti diagram
of all of your, all the steps you take in
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, kind of drawn out to complete a
task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that he, he looked at was,
oh, how do we, how do we take these
[SPEAKER_00]: principles and apply them specifically to
a farm thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a whole mobile stand that goes
around with him that has all the tools
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's going to need to complete that
task, whether it's harvesting lettuce or
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those, those things all stay
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has photos up so you could
walk into an area and see a picture of,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that area is supposed to look like
when it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that at the end of the day,
anyone who walks up could make that area
[SPEAKER_00]: look exactly how it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're always starting from the
same point too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, those key thing metrics were
like really helpful for me in thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how I might do a better job of,
you know, setting up processes and SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that also brings up a
really good point about, that will be more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more relevant to cannabis is GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or good manufacturing practices or good
agricultural practices, GAP certification,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you don't double back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it's an efficiency thing too,
but it's also, you know, really important
[SPEAKER_01]: for pest management and reducing
contamination with the facilities is to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that your processes,
you're not doubling back constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not only does that waste your time
and, you know, take more effort,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also you know, if you're in an area
that has some sort of like significant
[SPEAKER_01]: pest pressure and then moving into a
common area and then back and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, into your nursery, then you're
basically spreading contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout your facility.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always want to start in our areas that
need to stay the cleanest or that are our
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest and end the day in places that
are the dirtiest or can't afford to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dirtiest, meaning our mother plants
and our veg plants cloning, those have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to have a good
facility otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving through the rest of the
rest of the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, if you know you have thrips
in room three, that's the very last place
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to visit at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not, like you said, doubling
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I had a seven acre farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would walk around that thing so much
because I'd get to the back and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I want to weed this area back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd get back and I'd be like,
oh shoot, I forgot my bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got to walk all the way back up to
the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get back up there and like,
oh, I forgot my, you know, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm doing 10 minutes, 15 minutes of
walking just to complete a silly task or
[SPEAKER_00]: start a task that could have been really
avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest, like now I think about
it with everything I do even at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll be like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, um, all right, my,
my toilet paper, I want to keep near my
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't want it on the other side of,
of the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's just inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can take five steps to get to toilet
paper instead of, you know, 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where it is in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all of these things can just be
made more efficient if we just take a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment to think about, about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we both have toddlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that toilet paper could be
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your life does not have to be
hyper efficient, but I do think,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the things that we can do to
make our cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, more efficient is, is crucial,
especially when you have so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on all the time throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is another reason why these SOPs
are so important because you really do
[SPEAKER_00]: have to prioritize your time or the next
thing you know, you'll end up spending
[SPEAKER_00]: half the day doing something that wasn't
even on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you don't have the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're, let's say your air
conditioner breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you're being pulled away from
all the things that were on your mental
[SPEAKER_00]: checklist of things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you have an SOP, you can hand those
off to someone else to complete your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go deal with the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just really common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like in commercial facilities,
you're always putting out fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the more organization you have,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and I think the beauty
about being able to hand off your SOPs to
[SPEAKER_01]: someone too, is that, um, it can also show
your team that you trust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like so, so, so often, you know,
in the early days of, uh, licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cultivation, I noticed that so
many of my peers were like, jealously
[SPEAKER_01]: guarding their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they had these teams who,
you know, maybe worshiped this like
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, like a guru.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so amazing, you know,
but at the end of the day, like these
[SPEAKER_01]: people weren't learning how to run
facilities themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ultimately they were going to be
limited by this teacher gatekeeper who was
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to entrust them with key
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always going to be a little
secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could never really know the secret
sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and, and think about what,
what kind of culture that creates in your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, I know that traditionally,
you know, a lot of teachers have really
[SPEAKER_01]: jealously guarded their knowledge,
but, um, I know I really enjoyed working
[SPEAKER_01]: with my teams because, you know,
as they move up and they're able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of their own facility, or let's say
it means that I get to step away and work
[SPEAKER_01]: on another project because this person
over here is now, you know, proficient
[SPEAKER_01]: enough and skilled enough to take the,
the simple foundation of SOPs that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I created, and then they can run
their own garden over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and in many cases,
you know, they can add a couple of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that make it their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I think having a culture of
empowered people who are actually able to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you when you're putting out fires or,
you know, or just be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a teacher, enjoy seeing people learning
new things and, um, you know, and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at an SOP and being like,
Hey, could we maybe change this one thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be more efficient to do
this, you know, and sometimes you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, no, that won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other times you'll be like,
yeah, yeah, that would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be so much more efficient if we
did it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think having extra pairs of eyes
on your SOPs can be a really beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something to be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that being a good grower does
not necessarily mean that you're a good
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher or a good manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know one of my limitations is I'm
not good at managing large groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had the farm fully running with
20, 25 people on staff, uh, that wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: skillset that I really excelled at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so I don't want to say that
all growers don't jealously guard their
[SPEAKER_00]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some growers just aren't as
organized and some growers are just very
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive and, you know, can walk into a
room and see what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they have this mental checklist,
but they haven't taken the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily organize it or get it on the
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is sort of what you're talking
about is if you have, if you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: tool, um, it's a very useful tool to be
able to share with a team for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for growers that are, you know,
head growers or, or running a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is empowering to be able to share
that totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and, and actually, I mean,
you know, like I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in, you know, in the early days of
cultivation, um, what we had like Jorge
[SPEAKER_01]: Cervantes book, which was like the only
piece of information, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really had available to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, okay, we could,
um, you know, take information from
[SPEAKER_01]: unrelated crops and integrate them into
our cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, no one was, there's,
there's no soil testing happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there, you know,
we were working blind and so a lot of it
[SPEAKER_01]: for me was intuitive for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got along like that, you know,
just great until I had to lead a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, um, you know,
if I had one message to aspiring
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators, people who really,
really want to do this as a career in one
[SPEAKER_01]: which they can hire, you're going to need
to be able to take those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: take your, your knowledge, your,
your skillset and get it organized enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can share with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do, I guess, caution cultivators
once you, if, if you draft your SOPs and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're offered your dream job,
don't sign away your IP to whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: company recruits you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can, there are a bunch of ways in
your contract that you can share that IP
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you can usually get some
money upfront in your contract for
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying those SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but don't, uh, don't give up your
right to use them in any way you want in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my one caution where in that
particular case, you should be careful of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you share with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that SOPs have value as in
monetary value because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time and energy and experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of failures and wins that go
into creating your SOPs for, for anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gone through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that has value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whether, whether it's yours or mine
or, you know, even if you're in a tent and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think that's important to protect
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say though, that as a
commercial facility, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, because you want help with SOPs,
you can't just go buy an off the shelf SOP
[SPEAKER_00]: and think it's going to work perfectly in
your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there's so many intricacies to
every facility that makes them different
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think something like broad strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff's going to be the
same, but, but individually there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: too many little things that need to be
kind of dialed in at your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cause for sure, like the SOPs that
I use in, I mean, it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: similar in like an indoor facility to an
indoor facility, but then indoor to green
[SPEAKER_01]: house is you have to make a ton of
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you're working in like a very
similar, um, you know, a similar facility
[SPEAKER_01]: to indoor facilities, for instance,
the HVAC is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in facility A, let's say
that's like some old ghetto infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: and the SOPs need to be built.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the processes that we do are sort of
compensating for that, um, HVAC that could
[SPEAKER_01]: die at any moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like, okay, facility B,
it's state of the art things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just been built out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, HVAC is different,
lighting is different, and there are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a bunch of adjustments made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, even so, I think that there
are a number of things that can stay the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, but yeah, it's, it's, it's,
it's important never to fall asleep at the
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel thinking you've got the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SOP manual, uh, to rule all others,
because even if you get it really right in
[SPEAKER_01]: one system, there's always something you
can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, again, now that we
have information or access to so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: data, we can, especially with living soil
growers, we can hone our system better and
[SPEAKER_01]: better all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, like, I'm still learning
tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've basically been running a system
that's, it's very similar for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, even so it's like,
I'm learning more and more and more all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and integrating that into the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important not to get
complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning new things every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think it makes, it makes me a
better grower or cultivator, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: over time as I, as I keep learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your SOPs are constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important for people to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing that I,
that we haven't touched on that I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: important is having an SOP around every
type of pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've properly identified fungus
gnats, root aphids, fusarium, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you're dealing with, having a,
a targeted plan before this happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you, you're not just feeling not
only just overwhelmed and behind the gun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you, you, you have a plan moving
forward that you've already sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: established as a team or even just for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, and, and even better is
if you can provide visuals, just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking, it's like, you know,
providing a picture of a room that's
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, uh, you know,
if, if you can provide your team with a
[SPEAKER_01]: visual, like this is what a fungus gnat
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I even had some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is a fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a, you know, if,
if you're not looking closely,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can look like an aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the different pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here's, you know, how you can
properly identify this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then yeah, having an SOP for like,
okay, so if any pest is found,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to like, I call it,
you know, code orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anything arises, it's like,
okay, so immediately we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more hygienic as we move throughout the
facility, we're going to be more hygienic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be suiting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be extra careful about our
tools and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then, yeah, having, having those
SOPs for every single test or pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes up is it's, it just makes it so
much easier to respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you're catching this in
like flower, you only have so much time to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond, you know, and, and also there's
how you might respond in veg versus how
[SPEAKER_01]: you might respond in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have very limited tools by the time
you get to, you know, flower or even your
[SPEAKER_00]: mid flower, you're pretty much done
spraying at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a lot of things that you
can use in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so keeping pest pressure low up until
that point is, is crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and, and it's sort of a side note
and not as related to, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put this in my SOPs for,
um, potential clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're building out a facility,
I have some SOPs for clients to help guide
[SPEAKER_01]: them through that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those components is I highly
recommend each, if you can do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: each flowering harvest batch should be in
its own room or bay, if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then if a pest arises in flower,
yeah, you shouldn't be spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you just shouldn't, um,
you know, regardless of whether,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, a certain pesticide or
fungicide has been approved for use or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just so many, so many things
that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm not sure that I'm,
um, you know, entirely confident in,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the safety of pesticides that are
combusted, um, and what those might do and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they've been evaluated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in any case, I think, you know,
best practice, don't spray in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certainly not when you have,
um, you know, significant pistols that
[SPEAKER_01]: have already emerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if a pest arises, it arises,
you can kind of write it out in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just going to be the very last
room you go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might need to, to actually just
like harvest in the room and never,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, never take that material into
your common trim space or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, was there anything else around this
topic that you wanted to share that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't ask you about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think, um, I think one of
the, um, the cautionary, the cautionary,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, like pieces I have with SOPs and like,
so on social media, I see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for an SOP for blank and just know
that every single system is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, also to be really careful
because I've seen a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers put out information that,
um, that isn't accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, even in the living soil
community, um, you know, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers, they're probably really
well-meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they might, um, suggest a feed
that's really high in arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I have talked about this offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there are some inputs out
there, even by, um, companies that have
[SPEAKER_01]: like pretty significant followings,
um, that may cause you to fail for heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so don't just trust someone else's
process ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's really, really
important to evaluate whether it works for
[SPEAKER_01]: your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also just know there's like a lot
of BS out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, it's just people,
you know, generating content to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get more followers, more likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think you just need to be really
savvy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, even some of those
people are like, the cool kids in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, I think that even
though a lot of, uh, more mature growers
[SPEAKER_01]: will say, like, you know, I might see
these things and I don't want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody out on social media, but know
that there's like a huge community of
[SPEAKER_01]: people with a lot more experience who see
these comments and just sort of cringe
[SPEAKER_01]: because, well, I might not personally want
to get into a battle with somebody about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this potentially risky practice
that they're suggesting to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I see it out there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, you know, just, just always
keep, always be cautious about the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that you see, um, you know,
that, that, um, you know, that you see in
[SPEAKER_01]: social media or, or on the internet or
even from like reputable teachers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, just, just never stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the most reputable,
uh, folks to work with are people who will
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think you said it well,
it's a tough topic because you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the bad guy, um, either at least not
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also looking is, is the
education that you're getting from this
[SPEAKER_00]: company, is it product-based or is it
educational that gives you the tools to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually improve your growing process
without those products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something people I think can
take a little closer look at too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just did a podcast with,
uh, uh, Michael Brownbridge from BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a pathologist over there and they
were looking at Bavaria from various
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and some of these companies,
like one in particular in the living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: game is selling Bavaria where the spore
count is so low that it's, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to get any efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, you know, if you were to go
online and look at the reviews of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and, and, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And such, you would think that it was
highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference between marketing
and sales and, and what's actually works
[SPEAKER_00]: or what's actually best practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as an industry, you know,
I'd like to say we're going to get there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's kind of dominated the cannabis
industry since the advanced nutrients days
[SPEAKER_00]: way back, uh, you know, 20, 20,
30 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I think it'll always be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think folks just need to be really
like you said, discerning and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and think about what they're hearing and
question things from everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and again, like the,
the more simple approach with really
[SPEAKER_01]: simple inputs, like it's been successful
for growers for a really, really long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have never found like one particular
commercial product, like formulated
[SPEAKER_01]: product that was like a silver bullet,
you know, I've never, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's like a microbial inoculant,
whether it's a pesticide or a fungicide,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I haven't found, um, anything that is
as magical as marketing would have us
[SPEAKER_01]: believe, or that works in every single
instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think, I think the more
you can focus on those core SOPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: those core really simple inputs,
you can build a system that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong and then you can play with the
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't have to rely on them
and you don't have to spend a million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can just see where,
whether they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of what works, like I get
emails from people or photos and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're crushing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real happy with their program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, their SOPs may not be the same as
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they may be doing things that I don't
necessarily choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't choose to cover crop indoors
and I have my reasons why, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say there aren't people out there
doing it successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so at the end of the day,
if your SOP is working for you and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with what you're spending on your
crop, um, who am I to tell you otherwise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a guy that sent me photos of his
greenhouse and he encourages weeds and he
[SPEAKER_00]: loves it and his plants look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for him, that's an
ecosystem that's working really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is sort of in communion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, great, you know,
that's working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the reasons where I think you could
get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's just an
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing happy, healthy
plants, that's, that's what we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: going for in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, I don't, I don't want people
to get too caught up in, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's this perfect SOP for everyone
or that one person's right, that person's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think you can look at ways to
grow more cost effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's something you could
explore, even if you're growing great
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that maybe that's the next step,
but, but yeah, you know, do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and, and, and that's what,
you know, that's where the, the art of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I don't think there should
be any just, you know, single right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think if you also are enjoying
what you're doing, if you're having fun
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and you're passionate about it,
you're going to always put in the extra
[SPEAKER_01]: effort to, to make your plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's like a secret
ingredient that, that can't be overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time
today to share some of your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we can connect again on other,
other topics, uh, from a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, which is what I think you
really bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm really honored you'd have me on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Cassandra Maffey and you were

[SPEAKER_00]: science podcast.
