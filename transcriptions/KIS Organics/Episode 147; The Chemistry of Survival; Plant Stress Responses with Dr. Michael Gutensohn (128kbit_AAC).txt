[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, I wanted to
share about the Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Conference that we are hosting in
conjunction with Collective Elevation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bozeman, Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event is happening on September 5th
through 7th, 2025, and we are kicking it
[SPEAKER_00]: off with workshops from the Bug Lady
Suzanne and Dr. Greenhouse, followed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility tour and then a bunch of
excellent speakers that were former
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast guests such as Jeremy Plum,
Dr. Michael Brownbridge, Les Evans from
[SPEAKER_00]: DRAM, and many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be three days of talks and
networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the 7th, the Montana Living Soil
Alliance is hosting a tasting event that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be included in the price of the
conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tasting event will be a private event
with cannabis donated by the Living Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance as a way to have an amazing
sensory experience and see what premium
[SPEAKER_00]: quality Montana Living Soil has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early bird tickets are $200 and limited to
200 spots, so be sure to grab a ticket if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tickets are now on sale at kisorganics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bozeman in September is pretty beautiful
and is a popular spot, so best to lock
[SPEAKER_00]: down your ticket and accommodations early
to guarantee a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Michael Guttensohn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael is an associate professor of
horticulture at West Virginia University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He earned his diploma in biology from the
Julius Maximilians University in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he specialized in plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: While pursuing his PhD at the University
of Cologne in Germany and during a
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent postdoctoral position at the
Martin Luther University in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Guttensohn worked on multiple projects
studying metabolite and protein transport
[SPEAKER_00]: processes in plants using biochemical and
genetic approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: While at Purdue University for a second
postdoctoral position, he was introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: to his current research topic,
the biosynthesis of volatile organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, VOCs, in plants and their
various biological functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research interests include
plant-insect interactions, such as plant
[SPEAKER_00]: defenses against herbivores and pollinator
attraction to flowers, flavor compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural fruit crops, specialized
metabolites in medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: classical genetic and metabolic
engineering approaches, to introduce or
[SPEAKER_00]: improve desired VOC traits into crop
plants, and mechanisms regulating the flux
[SPEAKER_00]: in complex metabolic networks involved in
terpene formation in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Guttensohn is also involved in
steering the operations of the Analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochemistry Core Lab in the Division of
Plant and Soil Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw an article about your research
and reached out to you, and you were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to get back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've we've talked a little bit
offline, but I was hoping you could share
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your research and findings with
our audience and what you've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on at West Virginia University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, I mean, basic approach of what
we're doing is, is that we take a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a step back from looking at hemp
and cannabis more from the human
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, and maybe look a little bit
more at it from the from the plant side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to understand why certain
things as terpenes and cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_02]: being produced in hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the discipline that we I and
my lab are working in is also very often
[SPEAKER_02]: called chemical ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it takes exactly this approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're trying to understand why plants
produce what on the scientific side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things is called secondary or specialized
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, define that for listeners
as to what falls under secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites within the constituents of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is probably a term that most
people are not so familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, we talk about either
primary metabolites or secondary slash
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primary metabolites is something that most
people are pretty familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your carbohydrates, your carbs,
how people call them, your lipids and your
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we need in our nutrition,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should have a little bit of a
balance there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's primary metabolites,
and they're produced by all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organisms, including plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's specific about plants is that they
also produce a large set of other
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites and very small quantities very
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are called secondary or
specialized metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has a little bit to do with the
lifestyle of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I scare you or one of your listeners,
they probably would run off and flee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing for an animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If an animal is in a stress situation,
one of the easiest ways to get out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: is just to run away and flee.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant is rooted, it can't run away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has to fight back basically at
the spot where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why plants developed into being
absolute masters in producing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting and could also say nasty
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these specialized metabolites
plant produce because they have to somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with their environment and to a large
extent with their what we call a biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically with other organisms,
with other plants, with other microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course also with animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And among animals, I think for plants,
the most important ones are the insects
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's number wise probably what
they face most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for doing that, they produce these
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's no different for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we humans use or are interested in
hemp are actually chemicals that are there
[SPEAKER_02]: for a purpose to help the plants,
not necessarily us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of a little bit the
philosophy or approach that we're taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to kind of ignore to some
extent why humans are interested in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis and rather try to understand
why is the plant producing these things in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it actually helps better
understand how these things are regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: and produced in the plant when we're
trying to understand how.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that creates a lot of very
interesting and useful basic knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: that then you can apply later on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a little bit in a nutshell our
approach there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you studied factors that increased
secondary metabolites in hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically the most common ones that I
think of when I think of that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, THC, and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would all fall as secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any others that you were looking
at in some of your research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, when we do analysis,
we generally look at cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not just the ones that you mentioned,
although those of course are the most
[SPEAKER_02]: abundant ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We simply look from the point of view of
how much amount wise is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other big group of compounds
that we're looking at are the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the essential oils basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you normally perceive as the scent or
the smell simply because they go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: gas phase and you can sniff them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the two major classes,
but we in our analytics, we inevitably
[SPEAKER_02]: don't just see a few compounds there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned THC, CBD, and some of
the other well-known cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we do an analysis, we currently
are in a situation where we can roughly
[SPEAKER_02]: see about 50 different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I mean, if you look in
literature, there's over 100 cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: known by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's technically quite challenging to
detect all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, over the last couple of years,
we've definitely improved in our analytics
[SPEAKER_02]: and can detect more things now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same applies for the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see basically everything that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is just, can we really
identify undoubtedly everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always a little bit on the
cautionary side there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to lean myself too much out
of the window and claim I can identify
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we see a lot of things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the two major groups of
compounds we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you said before that we're
particularly interested in what induces
[SPEAKER_02]: the formation of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is actually that was sort of the
onset of a USDA grant that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: awarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2020, as one of the first ones that got
actually federal funding for working on
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the major question that we were trying
to address in this project was the
[SPEAKER_02]: so-called going hot problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So environmental factors triggering an
increase in the THC content that would
[SPEAKER_02]: push industrial hemp from its legal status
to surpassing the 0.3% THC content,
[SPEAKER_02]: literally turning it from a crop into a
drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to understand or identify
some environmental factors that would do
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also start understanding a little
bit the metabolic and genetic regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: that's behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you were working on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people listening to this podcast
are growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you would be, is it fair to
assume with the similarities between the
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that there may be some overlap in
terms of your results having similar
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on cannabis plants as you're
seeing with hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to be a little bit careful there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can definitely say we also tested
seed hemp varieties and not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or CBG varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, so seed hemp and CBD varieties
behaved in the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both saw an upregulation of THC
production under certain stress
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, at completely different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the THC level in a seed hemp
variety is fairly minimal compared to what
[SPEAKER_02]: you find in a CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in principle, in both cases,
but with both different types of hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw an increase in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to run anywhere close to
being in sort of risking or surpassing the
[SPEAKER_02]: legal THC limit with a seed hemp variety
because it's so little.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in principle, the induction you could
see as well there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on that, I would probably
conclude that, yes, there's a similar
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory mechanism in play, just that
you're starting from a different base
[SPEAKER_02]: line, so to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that determines how much
you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say if that's the same thing would
happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you probably know, the problem is that
we can still not work with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's on the research side in
academia, because it's still illegal at
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we do get federal funding,
we have to follow federal rules and laws
[SPEAKER_02]: and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So working with cannabis that has higher
THC level than 0.3% is off limits for us
[SPEAKER_02]: and will stay off limits as long as
there's no change in the legislation on
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be confusing for some people
if they think of, well, but wait a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in my state where I'm operating,
I'm a grower, it's legal to grow it here
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is we get federal funding
and that determines what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically depending on our funding
status.
[SPEAKER_02]: So universities cannot work with cannabis
because of the funding situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That limits us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can't tell you anything about
cannabis because I'm simply not in a
[SPEAKER_02]: situation that I can work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're saying is it's likely,
your hypothesis is that it's likely but
[SPEAKER_00]: not definitive that you would receive
similar effects based on the similarities
[SPEAKER_00]: of the two plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, based on the results that we have,
if I would ever come in a situation that I
[SPEAKER_02]: could work on cannabis, my hypothesis
would be that I would expect the same
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory mechanism to play, but of
course that would have to be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question of course is, I mean,
what I could envision or what you could
[SPEAKER_02]: put up as a counter argument there is
like, well, in cannabis you have already
[SPEAKER_02]: such a much higher THC level, maybe you're
sort of maxing out at some point and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't increase it even more because
there is already so much that there's no,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's other limitations that really
would limit it from being further
[SPEAKER_02]: increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be one thing, but I mean,
it's pure speculation at this point before
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not in the situation to test that,
you actually won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna talk to you about plant stress,
but before we do, because you brought this
[SPEAKER_00]: up, there was some, I think it was Dr.
Daniela Vergara with Cornell, I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that I talked to that mentioned this idea
of a dilution effect where a plant has the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic capability to only produce so many
cannabinoids or so much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it reaches a certain level
of biomass, that THC level in theory would
[SPEAKER_00]: be diluted across more greater surface
area because it's producing more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, as your yields increase,
some of the concentrations of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these secondary metabolites would in
theory go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing you could envision,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the question is like, how do you
achieve your final THC yield, so to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you wanna call it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought up biomass, that's of course
one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the more biomass or flowers a
plant produces, of course, the more yield
[SPEAKER_02]: you will have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that can be influenced by
the growth habit of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would bring up one other factor or
argument in there, and that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from my background, I'm a plant
biochemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so of course, I always look like more
from that perspective at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other factors that can limit
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to think about any of these
concepts and compounds, they're produced
[SPEAKER_02]: from certain precursors that need to be
provided from the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, you might just reach a
point where there's limitations on that
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant can just provide so much
building blocks, so to say, for making
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids as it can, without at some
point sacrificing other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a trade-off between
producing more, in this case would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, versus kind of needing other
things as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very often this kind of like,
what gives the plant more of a benefit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing more cannabinoids maybe versus
producing something else in a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we very often talk in the science side
of things, when we talk about metabolism,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're very often talk about networks
rather than sort of linear pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's anyway where science has moved
on the last 10, 20 years on the
[SPEAKER_02]: biochemistry side, that we understand that
everything's kind of like a huge network
[SPEAKER_02]: connected with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although very often we just look at
one final product, because that's what in
[SPEAKER_02]: a particular project you're interested in,
but you always have to keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is not isolated from all the rest
that's going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to kind of consider that
as well, that you're rather looking at one
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny little aspect of a gigantic network
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because if you're operating,
regulating one things, there's 250 other
[SPEAKER_02]: things happening in parallel and you can't
ignore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though you're kind of interested
in bringing up the level of that one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're interested in, you have to
consider that that's happening at the
[SPEAKER_02]: backdrop of everything else that's
happening there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there might be limitations that
come rather from this whole network that
[SPEAKER_02]: say like, well, that's enough now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do other things as well here,
because otherwise the plant's not doing
[SPEAKER_02]: well either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be one other factor sort of
limiting things at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that has me thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying essentially is a
plant has a certain amount of resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: limited amount of resources, and it
allocates those resources based on its
[SPEAKER_00]: goals, either plant defense, to protect
itself in the case, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: if someone scared you, you could run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant would have to produce
these secondary metabolites to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: itself from insects, environmental
conditions, whatever, or as a way of a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuation of its species by
reproduction essentially, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm understanding correctly,
we have a limited amount of resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant is going to allocate those
resources towards one of those goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's reproduction, protection,
growth, overall growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a constant, I don't know what
the word I'm looking for here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a constant process, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Balancing these various different things
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's constantly a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you raise one thing up,
you're intimately going to lose at some
[SPEAKER_02]: other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's only so much in total
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, if you want to really go
all the way down, I mean, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately, anything that a plant produces
and does comes from photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the photosynthetic capacity of a plant
basal limits, how much is there,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much resources are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do more than what it fixes in
photosynthesis and for form of fixing
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon dioxide and producing sugar
molecules initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how much nitrogen you can take up from
the soil or other nutrients that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ultimately limits things,
how much is there, and that limits what
[SPEAKER_02]: you can make out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an input and there's an output,
so to say, and that ultimately needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these things limit in the end how
much you can produce of a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: compound, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, growth, reproduction in form of
seed production or in other crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be fruit production.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's other factors that play into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't just ignore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the examples I think of that
kind of highlights this is the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant that you threw out because it
was sickly or a seed that got lost and
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up in your compost pile and it was
neglected all season long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet this plant was able to survive and
not thrive because it probably had
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient stress and drought stress and
maybe heat stress, but it was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive through all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, when that plant is ending its
life cycle, what I've seen is higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of secondary metabolites,
higher THC, maybe higher levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, all of these secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yield is dramatically lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sickly plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But due to all of these stresses from
being neglected, we tend to see higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will say the best cannabis I ever
smoked or grew was this poor plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was horribly stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that is that sort of fit with this
idea of allocation of resources as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was just trying to survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's not necessarily just the
plant survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the species survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants don't function necessarily at the
level of individual plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to survive as a species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what plants very often do if
they're in what you describe like a
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient deficiency or so like just a not
a very good environmental condition,
[SPEAKER_02]: which yes, you can create in your
greenhouse and your growth facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you neglected it or overwatered it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the important things that plants
very often do is they try to reproduce
[SPEAKER_02]: produce seeds in the hopes that the next
generation actually finds better
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it will try to somehow get through
and produce even if it's just a few
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it basically in the hopes of
maintaining itself as a species,
[SPEAKER_02]: it produces seeds, which is the next
generation and then hopes that those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: are spread somewhere in a place where
where there's better conditions or next
[SPEAKER_02]: season is the weather is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is more more rain or better
conditions or the seed is carried to some
[SPEAKER_02]: other environment where the soil is more
fertile or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, you always have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants function in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that goes back to
what I said at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is you if you want to understand what
plants do and if it is a crop plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp or cannabis are crop plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This applies to a crop land in the same
way like to any wild plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, crop lands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few things that are different
because we humans over hundreds of better
[SPEAKER_02]: say thousands of years have sort of
selected certain things and certain trades
[SPEAKER_02]: have been manipulated in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this basic regulation is
still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we want to understand our plans,
then you really have to put yourselves in
[SPEAKER_02]: the literally have to put yourselves in
the shoes of a plant to understand how
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that goes back to what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you have to I think for
understanding hemp and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you sometimes have to take a step
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, well, I know our final goal
is to grow hemp or cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose of getting cannabinoids or other
purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why is why I think is happening in
there in the first place?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for understanding that you have to
take the human component out a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: and look rather from the plant side of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're trying in my lab and
in our research, we're really trying to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and it's like, OK, why are these
things happening in the first place and
[SPEAKER_02]: what are the underlying mechanisms that
are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can kind of understand one
factor when any crop land is that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to consider while there was human
domestication and then cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding happening for eventually
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, that's not a wild plant
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some things were selected or changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the basic regulation is still
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hasn't gone away and will not go
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you studied essentially what
would cause a plant to go pot to create
[SPEAKER_00]: more of these second secondary metabolites
before we go into what your findings were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have a question about plant stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking this whole time
essentially about plant stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: what stresses plants out and it's a
variety of things off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have heat stress, you can have
cold stress, you can have a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of environmental stress
like drought stress over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your, you know,
biotic stress like insect pressures,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, herbivory with an insect eating
the leaf itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all stresses to this to plants the
same or do they have different effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that, I mean, plants need to respond
to all stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we basically you outlined it perfectly
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in principle, you can categorize things
in two major buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one is a biotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that is in the environment,
that's not another organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned water stress,
heat, cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, I mean, even light stress in the
sense of UV or too much light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all sorts of factors that can
involve that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, nutrition,
lack of it or too much salinity,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of things that can
go into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acidity or sort of pH value of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other side, yes, as you
mentioned, it's the biotic side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically microbes on the one
hand side, which very often are like
[SPEAKER_02]: either pedichins that harm the plants or
they're helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're like fixing nitrogen or
mycorrhizae that help taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course it's animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, they can be beneficial or they
can be sort of harmful herbivores,
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, growers will know that your
beneficial insects in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: in your growth facility to kind of fight
pests and plants actually act to very
[SPEAKER_02]: often actively attract these beneficial
insects for helping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how a plant responds to these
different abiotic and biotic stresses can
[SPEAKER_02]: be quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't generalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every individual factor can have a
different consequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants, some of these specialized or
secondary metabolites help the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: actually sort of cope with some of these
abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have certain things that almost
work like a sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they protect plants from too much light
or light stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things very often sort of help with
sort of some of the consequences of some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so cannabinoids are maybe not
necessarily falling directly in that
[SPEAKER_02]: category, but of course you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that before that sometimes
plants, hemp plants, cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_02]: respond with sort of an alteration in
their cannabinoid level.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they experience some of this abiotic
stress, but that sometimes could be rather
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of an indirect effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're changing sort of supply of
nutrition, if there's too much or too
[SPEAKER_02]: little, then that's kind of like,
if you see a change on the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: level, that might be rather kind of an
indirect effect that overall metabolism of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant is affected and then that's
affecting cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one thing that can happen
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the biotic stress, that's a
completely different thing because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of these secondary metabolites are
specifically produced and very often
[SPEAKER_02]: upregulated to deal with these stress
situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with biotic stress, with being attacked
by pedigons or pests, that's one of their
[SPEAKER_02]: main purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's no different for terpenes or
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you're saying is all
stresses are not the same and don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're getting in terms of
cannabinoid effect is actually not the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary mechanism or necessarily what the
plant is focused on when it's creating
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I understanding kind of what you're
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we haven't done much on the
abiotic side, but of course, I'm aware
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's quite a bit of literature out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would have a little bit of a hard
time seeing how a cannabinoid molecule
[SPEAKER_02]: could help a plant with dealing with some
of these abiotic stresses, sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: directly dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other compounds where you can make
a direct connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produce some of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, it works like a
viewpoint, putting on some lotion or
[SPEAKER_02]: sunscreen basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoids don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, from where they're being
produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And second of all, also from their
chemistry, I would have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: hard time seeing how that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying like drought stress,
like increasing terpene levels in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or increasing CBD does not directly help a
plant that's experiencing drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be some sort of secondary
mechanism that occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be either a secondary mechanism,
sort of kind of like just something in
[SPEAKER_02]: metallic metabolism is altering and that
kind of results in some consequence in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid or terpene formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you could argue for is a
plant is generally stressed by an abiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's potentially also at risk
of being more susceptible to biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're anyhow stressed, you're weakened
because of some environmental factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a drought or there's something
else going on in your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically in a weak,
susceptible status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes you more prone for being
attacked by pests or pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in that context, of course,
it would make sense to upregulate some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds because really you're
still trying to defend yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's not the abiotic factor
that you directly are kind of like dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a consequence of the abiotic factor
weakening you, so to say, as a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that results in potentially being
at more at risk of being prone to other
[SPEAKER_02]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying as the plant receives
drought stress, it thinks, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my gosh, I'm now more I'm weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more open to pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by increasing my terpenes or my
cannabinoids, I may better protect myself
[SPEAKER_00]: from these pests that are more likely to
hit me now that I'm more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the biological explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the biological benefit of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're increasing your likelihood of
surviving or reproducing, at least to the
[SPEAKER_02]: extent that guarantees the survival of you
as a species, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always have to look at the
biological purpose of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, you can draw that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that that's what it is
because, I don't know, we haven't looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in other plants, that's clearly there
is a connection between abiotic stress and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these responses, which is in some
cases, it's not clear that the increased
[SPEAKER_02]: production of some of these secondary
metabolites would help dealing with this
[SPEAKER_02]: abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it basically protects the plant from
potential other things in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a popular term or concept in the last
few years has been this idea of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering, which is I don't know if you're
familiar with or not, but it's essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: intentional stress that you're giving to
the plant to create a certain response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some examples of this, it's cannabis
growers have tried everything over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years would be, you know, what they call
drybacks, essentially intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: withholding water to create drought stress
at certain stages of plant growth or
[SPEAKER_00]: withholding nutrients or getting closer to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of people reducing CO2 and
reducing light levels to lower stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then on the flip side, cooling the
rooms that they're in as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing cold stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know what sorts of targeted stress
levels will you know, what mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: create this effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a complicated question.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, in principle, I can see why
people would try these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: because of course, you're you're whenever
you're changing an environmental factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's essentially what you're doing
with all those things that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioning there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the plant will will respond to
that in one or the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I mean, one of the first things
that I would bring up in that in that
[SPEAKER_02]: point, for example, and I don't know if
there's there's sort of more, more
[SPEAKER_02]: trustworthy documentation or scientific
work on that for for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you have to think about
some of this might also regulate flower
[SPEAKER_02]: induction.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many flowers you get, the ratio
between flowers and vegetative growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like you're manipulating the
growth of a plant in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that logically has has some
consequences there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I mean, like I said before,
I mean, certain abiotic factors will have
[SPEAKER_02]: consequences on the level of metabolites
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, and I mean, I'm very well aware
that people probably have done a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff just by trial and error and trying
to play around with things with conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: and see what the consequence of that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not much different than what we
do on the science side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say we play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We normally start off with a well-defined
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, we we don't know things
and then we test things just that we do it
[SPEAKER_02]: under much more, let's say a little bit
more controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do it not just one time,
but we do a lot of replications and very
[SPEAKER_02]: thorough data collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then data analysis later on to really
kind of verify or reject a hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_02]: you might have had before there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I'm not saying that that's not
not reasonable to assume that some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things would lead to to respective
consequences on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, I mean, we initially
were kind of considering abiotic factors
[SPEAKER_02]: in our our work a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since the initial results we got in
the first year or year and a half were
[SPEAKER_02]: much more promising and interesting on the
on the biotic side of things, we very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly then decided to primarily focus on
that in particular because that is also a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more in alignment with other
projects not related to hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that are ongoing in my lab here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally I work a lot with plant insect
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so logically, once we saw respective
responses in hemp plants to insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: we kind of focused primarily on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one question I want to just propose to
you is something that the sort of my
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to understanding this is plants
all have this genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're cultivating and we're
trying to get them to reach this potential
[SPEAKER_00]: and then any sort of stress that they
have, while it may increase secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite metabolites, it could also
impact yields negatively because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has a certain amount of resources it can
allocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm under the philosophy and please
feel free to correct me on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that every facility grower cultivation
I've ever been to has stress plant stress
[SPEAKER_00]: just naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't perfected this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a growth chamber, maybe you're
able to get a lot closer to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the reality of cultivating it
commercially or even at home, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally going to have some of these
stress events occur already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal as a cultivator is to
create the best environment I can for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to reach its genetic potential and
assume that it's still going to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that approach
versus this idea of more targeted stress
[SPEAKER_00]: events?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in general, the take of providing
the best environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to say so, is for sure the
best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to intentionally harm your
plants because yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you do that in the wrong time
or in the wrong way, you simply will
[SPEAKER_02]: sacrifice your yield overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some targeted sort of treatment,
if you want to call it that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: at a certain time point to sort of
increase the level of certain things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to sort of achieve there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sort of from the get go, intentionally
stressing your plans all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really not think that that would
be a particularly good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, initially, you want to make sure
that your plan grows up properly,
[SPEAKER_02]: is in a good, healthy condition,
good growth stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you then at some point set sort of the
right trigger, through some treatment of
[SPEAKER_02]: your growth conditions, your environmental
conditions, yes, you might achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is similar things you do
with other crops as well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but you got to be careful with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like just sort of trying to harm
your plant intentionally for an extended
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time is probably not a good idea
there in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is we may find that
most of and this is another thing is we
[SPEAKER_00]: have such genetic diversity in cannabis
that we can't make the assumption that all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to reply, you know,
respond the same because of the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may find that two weeks out from
harvest, for example, extreme drought
[SPEAKER_00]: stress or extreme cold stress may have a
positive effect on secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: production without having as large of an
impact on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might become best practice down
the road, but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, keep in mind, you keep your plants
in a vegetative state for quite a while
[SPEAKER_02]: before then they start flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no sense of stressing your plants
while they're in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you want to have a good baseline,
so to say, of vegetative growth because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the resources that you ultimately
then can remobilize and put into flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're having a weak plant before,
well, what's the sense of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to work out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we definitely don't want to create any
stress early on in the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little bit about your
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of hinted at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about what your sort
of methodology was and what your results
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this goes way back to what I
said at the beginning a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: this chemical ecology approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, one of the major stresses
that any plant will face in its lifetime
[SPEAKER_02]: is mainly biotic stress and in particular,
insects, herbivory, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we can talk about herbivory in
a little bit of a broader sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, herbivory is not just insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is something we might
want to consider a little bit more when we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get back to that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So herbivory could be also by other
animals, by mammals, by little rodents or
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbits or goats or sheep or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you consider the size of a hemp
plant, it's not a tiny little plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a quite substantial plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine that other animals
would feed on a hemp plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure if at the flowers, but definitely
somewhere on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely the other major factor that
kind of harms plants in that respect are
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's normally why plants produce a
lot of these specialized metabolites,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically fending off this herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any herbivore that consumes some of the
leaf material, the plant, the vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: part, even if it's in the roots,
would be facing or would be exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: such specialized or secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's no different for a hemp or
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the early on experiments
that we did was we kind of initially
[SPEAKER_02]: mimicked herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that by some chemical
treatment, basically, that is a signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: compound that's actually a plant normally
produces itself when it's exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we measured trypian and
cannabinoid contents.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw already that that led to an
upregulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a first clear indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they're responding to that,
which was not surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just easier to do that because it's
barely you spray a chemical on the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can see the response and you don't
actually need the actual insect feeding on
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But logically, that was our next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we saw these first preliminary data
and seeing that the plant was responding
[SPEAKER_02]: to that, then, of course, we looked for an
insect system that we could use on hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of looked around and talked
with some people from various extension
[SPEAKER_02]: services to see, like, what are real
insect pests that you're seeing in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we also looked for
something that's actually relevant and
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to get your hands on in our region
here in Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out, actually, that beet
armyworm was a real pest that was an issue
[SPEAKER_02]: that growers had to face and deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, there's a small
company that rears these insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: these larvae, and we can simply buy them
from them and get them shipped here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no legal restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes with pest insects,
you've got to be a little bit careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just move them over set lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in case of beet armyworm, that wasn't
the problem because it is already a
[SPEAKER_02]: natural pest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not introducing something that
wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we finally settled on using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get little caterpillars that are
pre-reared already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep them here for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually allow them to feed on
our hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually do quite a bit of damage
in a relatively short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start off feeding on leaves,
but then at some point, they also move to
[SPEAKER_02]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have damage on leaves and we also have
damage on flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then under very controlled conditions,
we kind of determined how long we had to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave them on there and then measured
cannabinoid contents and indeed saw that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid production was quite
significantly upregulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually upregulated to a level where
we would be in violation or could get into
[SPEAKER_02]: violation if we were would be growers of
the legal limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this clearly indicated that insect
herbivory, if you're growing CBD hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be a problem for you as a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, one of the easy to take home
messages from that work was already just,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, you got to scout for insects,
pest insects if you're growing and you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to take care of that, which I know is not
easy because depending on what time and
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle of your plants, you probably
don't want to spray much because I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're running into problems there
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But scouting early on, making sure you
don't have a lot of herbivory and if so,
[SPEAKER_02]: take the right measures is definitely one
of the core things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the first finding,
but then the story kind of developed a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that compounds, major cannabinoids
like THC, CBD, CBG, some of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: were upregulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we saw since we're in our
cannabinoid analysis, we're not just
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing those major cannabinoids,
but we're seeing a lot of other so-called
[SPEAKER_02]: minor cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we were surprised is to see that
those were also upregulated and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: also quite, not all of them, but some of
them and some of them actually quite
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things that were in our analytics
before tiny little peaks and difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: detect were very detectable afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So significantly upregulated and
increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, of course, we got really excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I draw our attention to because of
like, we were wondering what the heck is
[SPEAKER_02]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And terpenes were also upregulated,
but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also not to an extent that was really
very extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of an upregulation,
but nothing really that was particularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't knock me out of my shoes that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a little bit surprising
because we originally had, my expectation
[SPEAKER_02]: when we started this was that rather the
terpenes might be affecting insects
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what they do in a lot of
other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a couple of other projects where
we do similar things and very often
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes or some terpenes are the ones
that are actually really kind of affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my initial assumption or
expectation or hypothesis was that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, in hemp it's probably also gonna be
terpenes being involved in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the first results, it did not
look quite like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna exclude that the terpenes
play no role, but it was that the response
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cannabinoid side was much more
significant than what we saw on the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a little unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have a few questions from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question is in relation to the
terpenes, are we talking a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant increase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for some of them, not all of them,
but for some of them it was a significant
[SPEAKER_02]: increase, but it was from the extent was
not as dramatic as some of the responses
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw on the cannabinoid side.
[SPEAKER_02]: In case of some of the cannabinoids,
we see like a five-fold increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying massive increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really massive increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying THC necessarily or CBD,
but some of the other things we really see
[SPEAKER_02]: like quite significant increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the terpenes, we maybe see a one
and a half fold increase or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by far not as dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that they don't play any
role, but it was really not kind of quite
[SPEAKER_02]: what we had expected initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that got us really kind of like a
little bit wondering what the heck is
[SPEAKER_02]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, whenever you find something
like that, of course, we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand why that biologically makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you have these upregulation of
cannabinoids there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that brings me back to what we were
talking about before with the herbivores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an upregulation of THC or
CBD and your herbivore is a mammal,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying a human, but a mammal,
a little rodent, you can explain how that
[SPEAKER_02]: might affect that herbivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have the same cannabinoid
receptors that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying they're getting a high,
but they're for sure going to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: experience there or some exposures to it
and would probably kind of reconsider
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding on that plant the next time
potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see how that would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thing is with insects,
they don't have the cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: that we and other mammals have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that of course brings up the question
like, then how does it affect insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there cannabinoids that affect
insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I was wondering is how target
is, are plants able to distinguish in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to like, how target is their
approach, defensive approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, can a plant
distinguish between thrips damage and
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillar damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe for thrips, it may increase
terpenes, whereas caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_00]: it focuses on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a possibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are plants not able to tell if I'm
cutting it with scissors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I assume there's some sort of
chemical interaction happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned, with being able to
spray something to get a similar plant
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing you can distinguish
on the insect side is what type of insect
[SPEAKER_02]: you have there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you brought two examples up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one is caterpillars, which fall into
the group of so-called biting,
[SPEAKER_02]: chewing insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually really consume leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bite into tissue and munch it up,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other example that you had was thrips,
or you could add a couple of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: things like aphids, whiteflies,
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are generally kind of considered as
piercing sucking insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they either feed on the vascular tissue
or the content of it, or they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: suck out cell content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they puncture individual cells and
really suck the content of the cell up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a completely different type of
feeding, so to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the damage that you're seeing is a
completely different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did not see much response with
piercing sucking insects, although we have
[SPEAKER_02]: not really used them a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people have seen effects when
they were using aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to exclude that,
but we haven't seen that in our analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we primarily kind of concentrated on
biting, chewing insects that really have
[SPEAKER_02]: to consume tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have used a couple of
different ones in the meanwhile,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we see the same response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're pretty sure that that is pretty
uniform there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that the plant can't
distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there is a difference in the
response of plants if they're sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing herbivory by biting,
chewing insects versus a piercing sucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though the signaling within the plant
is different when they're exposed to these
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the other thing that you just
mentioned before is so what the plant can
[SPEAKER_02]: perceive is not just when you have a
caterpillar or a beetle nibbling around
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the wounding of tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant can actually recognize the
insect side of things as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants do have per se in general have
receptors for the saliva of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just the wounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is publications not from hemp,
but from other plants where plants can
[SPEAKER_02]: perceive the feces of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very often, if there's a caterpillar or
a beetle or something like roaming around
[SPEAKER_02]: on a plant, they basically defecate on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They leave their feces behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are things in there that the
plant can recognize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants can recognize quite a lot of
things, sort of traces that an insect
[SPEAKER_02]: would leave behind if it's on a plant and
feeding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone might develop a caterpillar
feces spray someday that we could spray on
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant to get up regulation of
secondary metabolites, in theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you from research that people
have actually collected the saliva of
[SPEAKER_02]: insects and have diluted that and sprayed
it on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that led to a response even without
the wounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can combine it with the wounding
and you even get a stronger response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some good literature out there,
not from hemp necessarily or cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but from other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is by now, it's pretty
accepted that that's a pretty general
[SPEAKER_02]: response of plants that they're capable of
recognizing these sorts of things.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one other thing you touched on,
I just want to highlight and make sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, is this idea that chewing
insects, like the caterpillars that you
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with, create a much higher response
in terms of secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: production than sucking piercing insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the practical application of this might
be if you are seeing aphids in your hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, that may be less concerning than
caterpillars or rodent damage or other
[SPEAKER_00]: things in terms of the THC response that
you may see from that herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, just pure hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, we did not see a
response when we mimicked aphid feeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we never used aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mimic this kind of feeding with some
treatments there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not see a response there,
but I'm aware that there are some reports
[SPEAKER_02]: from other groups where they did see a
response of plants upon aphid feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to completely exclude
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say we did not see it,
but that doesn't mean... This could be,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, what you mentioned before,
your genetic diversity, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there are some varieties where you
see that response and others not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we only used a few hemp
varieties and not too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it needs to be manageable on our
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wouldn't generalize it as you
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you might be right that I would be
more concerned about sort of herbivory by
[SPEAKER_02]: caterpillars or beetles or surviving
chewing insects if you're concerned about
[SPEAKER_02]: your THC level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not say that I would not be
worried about aphid infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem in general is that piercing
sucking insects very often serve as
[SPEAKER_02]: vectors for viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even a very low level of infestation
can create a lot of problems because once
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants are infested with a virus,
there is no cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you definitely, as a grower,
you definitely should scout for these
[SPEAKER_02]: insects as well very carefully and take
respective measures if you find them on
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants because any of these little
critters can barely make your plants sick
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you really got a problem there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not because of the THC level,
but maybe because of the overall status of
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants, basically, and your entire
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, pathogens are pretty
devastating to crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you seen any research of
pathogens increasing secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, I mean, we never worked with
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not necessarily aware of a lot of
literature, but I don't want to exclude it
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, turpines definitely have an effect
on pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently working on something
similar here in collaboration with another
[SPEAKER_02]: group here with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's plenty literature where
turpines have been shown to have in
[SPEAKER_02]: general antimicrobial activity,
which includes bacteria and fungi as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not aware that cannabinoids are
having similar effects, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to completely exclude it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the turpines definitely have quite
dramatic effects there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could very well have an effect in
hemp and cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis seems to respond pretty well
to pretty aggressive pruning, mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning today about how a plant can
sense all of these other aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had assumed that when we were pruning
heavily, we were mimicking at least
[SPEAKER_00]: certain aspects of herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are your thoughts on that,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we create these similar mimicry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So any type of wounding of a plant in
principle kind of has somewhat of that
[SPEAKER_02]: effect or can have that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing you have to keep in mind is
that if you do pruning or do by accident
[SPEAKER_02]: wound your plant one time, that might very
briefly induce something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this is happening on a time
scale, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you wound a leaf, you might see a
little introduction but that drops back
[SPEAKER_02]: down to baseline level very quickly with,
I wouldn't say within hours, but within a
[SPEAKER_02]: day or so very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a more substantial upregulation,
you would have to have a little bit more a
[SPEAKER_02]: persistent and ongoing sort of process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's normally what you'd rather face
if you have an infestation with a
[SPEAKER_02]: herbivore.
[SPEAKER_02]: A herbivore normally doesn't just come by,
bite in one leaf and then move on and go
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It normally stays on your plant for quite
a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, a lot of insects have
the ability to propagate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're not going to have just one
insect nibbling on your plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in no matter of time, you're probably
going to have multiple insects nibbling on
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that is this persistent ongoing
herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, of course, leads to a completely
different response from the extent that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting because when I
think about it as an indoor cultivator,
[SPEAKER_00]: we tend to have to do defoliation of most
genetic cultivars just to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light and air that's getting to
plant and maximize our photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the risk of pathogens and pest
pressure by having microclimates inside
[SPEAKER_00]: our canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're saying is when we do that,
when we say certain plant responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're short lived, whereas that
insect is going to be constantly nibbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's essentially just keeping the
plant stressed the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a regulation of that over a
longer period, which is more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to these increases in metabolite
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at one time pruning, yeah, you might
see a little bit of an effect there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not going to be very persistent
versus if you have an a pest infestation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which normally lasts for quite a bit of
time, then you're probably going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: much more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question, of course,
is also at what time of the sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth cycle are you going to have that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume your pruning you do not on
the very last stage of before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably would do that sometimes
earlier because you kind of like like you
[SPEAKER_02]: described, you kind of want to get maximum
light exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have airflow in there and
maybe avoid these microclimates,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably not going to do that in
the very two days before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do that while you're
cultivating, while you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you do that sort of in the
more vegetative part of the growth stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to have much of an
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have that in the very last
stage shortly before you start harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, then, of course, and then if
it's extended, then you might see much
[SPEAKER_02]: more of an effect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, it's the timing and the
frequency of sort of these events
[SPEAKER_02]: happening that might have an influence
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a pretty big defoliation,
say, like week three of flower week two,
[SPEAKER_00]: right around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I like to go through and just
pick leaves when I'm in my when I'm in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as I'm going through it, because the
plants always receive spawn bounce back so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if that might actually have
some benefit, though the downside of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make people aware, when you're
doing any sort of wounding, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: opening yourself up to greater risk of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've created a perfect place for
pathogens in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's pros and cons to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose we may see increased benefit
from herbivory, but we may see a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: higher risk of of pathogen pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: One on a very on a very practical side,
I mean, if you're using tools for doing
[SPEAKER_02]: your pruning, you want to be very careful
because you could be spreading diseases
[SPEAKER_02]: from one plant that is affected,
infected to others just using the same
[SPEAKER_02]: clippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even without any pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, like we're always very careful
with these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you want to wash and sanitize your
your tools that you're using in your in
[SPEAKER_02]: your growth facility if you're moving
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're maybe already suspecting that
you have something that's diseased
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you don't need any other factor
for spreading things is actually you
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading things from one plant to the
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And insects can be a vector, too,
for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a couple other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to totally switch gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm looking at an article about you in
greenhouse management online here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that it mentions is
that you're allowed was studying
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and
plant roots and how that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production or accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know we've been talking for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll have to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you touch briefly on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was one one idea initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really didn't get too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had we had another group here in my
college here that that that is is is
[SPEAKER_02]: working on on mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, for quite a number of years,
we were hosting what's called INVEM,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is one of the largest international
national and international collection of
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meanwhile, since the faculty that
was in charge of that retired,
[SPEAKER_02]: that has moved on and is now in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still had some of that collection
here and we were just trying to play
[SPEAKER_02]: around with that to see if micro actually
how good they interact with hemp or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ran into quite a bit of roadblocks
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it doesn't work at all,
but that was kind of not particularly too
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to work it out in particular because
for the purpose of how we need to how we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to do these inoculations for the for
the research side of things, the growth
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions the hemp plants really didn't
like particularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not saying that mycorrhizal fungi
would not interact with with the roots of
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But under the conditions that these folks
here wanted to grow the plants for
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculation, the hemp plants just didn't
like the condition particularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of gave up a little bit at some
point following up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't really tell you much about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can tell you what we're currently
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that follows a little bit more on
along the lines of what I was describing
[SPEAKER_02]: before with herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently looking into interaction
of nematodes with the roots of hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that could that could lead to a
very similar response as the herbivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some promising results in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're following up on that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope in the next couple of weeks,
we can actually collect some more samples
[SPEAKER_02]: and then do some more analysis on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking a little bit into that
because that could be another point where
[SPEAKER_02]: you could have one of these biotic
interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you're probably not going to
see nematodes if you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have your hemp or cannabis
plants grown in a field situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're definitely going to see nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing you can do about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What species of nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking like root-knot nematodes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're testing a couple of different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's that's one of them we're
testing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that is a little bit on the
backdrops and got to go back a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: to what I said before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we had seen with the insect
herbivory that we have this massive
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation of some of these minor
cannabinoids, we kind of started to think
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of how this actually makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we did is that
we actually looked into other plant
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues than you would normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most people probably know, of course,
we're all aware that cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_02]: formed in trichomes of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also trichomes on leaves and they
do produce some cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the profile is a little bit
different than in the flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there is and the levels are much
lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really systematically a little bit
more systematically looked into different
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tissues in hemp plants as to if they
would be producing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long story short, yes, there are
cannabinoids and other plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just flowers and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing that, now it starts making
much more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also found some cannabinoids and
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a little bit the background of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're maybe the cannabinoids and
the roots also have an effect on biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions in the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't yet confirm that finally,
but I mean, everything that we have points
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit in this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we're following up on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in particular, it seems to be not the
usual major cannabinoids that play a role
[SPEAKER_02]: in these things, but it's rather some of
the minor cannabinoids that play a role
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what could be is that some of the major
cannabinoids are actually there either due
[SPEAKER_02]: to human cultivation or more for
interaction with mammals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of these minor cannabinoids
are actually there for interaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: insects and other non mammalian
herbivores, if you want to phrase it that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you consider that,
it would make perfect sense if some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds are being produced in
other tissues that of course are being
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed to herbivory, similar to leaves or
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little bit where we are right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see what your results are
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not something that was even on my radar in
terms of thinking of like root herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, one other thing that is
becoming clear now, and that was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the big questions on the science
side of things is a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: why are we aware of cannabinoids just in
the context of hemp and cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they indeed the only plant producing
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has a little bit to do with the
biochemistry of things, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: building blocks that you need to make a
cannabinoid compound are actually present
[SPEAKER_02]: in principle in any other plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as for us on the biochemistry side,
it was a little bit of a puzzle to accept
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that cannabinoids would be really
just produced in cannabis plants and not
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually in the last couple of years,
literally the last three, four years,
[SPEAKER_02]: there have been a few publications now
from other plants where cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_02]: being found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems to be not just cannabis,
but other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fungi, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are some other organisms that
can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in plants, there are some other
plants, and they're not related to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing that's kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of one of the questions
out there that we were also kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not working on this currently,
but of course, we're following this
[SPEAKER_02]: literature and this area of quite interest
in particular with knowing what we found
[SPEAKER_02]: with respect to herbivory, where we like
wondering, well, if you can produce it in
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants as well, then it might become
much more interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we actually, and I think I
mentioned that in our last meeting already
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, that we have recently
submitted a provisional patent on some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these minor cannabinoids due to their
insecticidal activity that we discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we think that if they really have
this activity, as we've found,
[SPEAKER_02]: this could be something where we could
actually use some of those as an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: insecticide, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could also go down the road and
basically not breed, because of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't breed if it's not a cannabis
plant, but you could genetically engineer
[SPEAKER_02]: it in other plants and basically by that
protect other plants through cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that if cannabinoids
truly are a response to herbivory and may
[SPEAKER_00]: offer some sort of insect protection,
you would expect to find it in other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants too, because other plants would
have evolved to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're saying that in recent
years, we've discovered that it does exist
[SPEAKER_00]: in other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just stronger evidence that
the possibility these minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: may play a role in plant defense and that
down the road, we may be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate that or understand,
utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question, though, because we've
already gone over our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned this, and I hadn't heard
this, that you can use terpenes as a
[SPEAKER_00]: biofuel additive in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just, in a minute or two,
just touch on that, because I found that
[SPEAKER_00]: real fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never heard this.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a completely different
avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is quite a bit of interest in
terpenes as sort of a fuel, either as an
[SPEAKER_02]: additive or even as a pure fuel by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simple logic behind it is terpenes are
volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're scent compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, from their physical, physical
chemical properties, go into the,
[SPEAKER_02]: emit into the atmosphere at relatively low
temperatures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So barely at ambient room temperatures,
they're emitted into the gas phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why plants are using them as a
way of communicating, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a property that you want to
have for fuel as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the problems with biofuels is
that, I mean, if you take your canola oil
[SPEAKER_02]: as a biodiesel, if you put that in the
tank of your car, and in winter the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures are low, your oil starts
solidifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely your vegetable oil points,
turns into margarine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you can't drive on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem because it's not liquid
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same problem you're also facing,
if you think about sustainable,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's called sustainable aviation fuels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're flying a plane at 30,
35,000 feet altitude, it's minus 60
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, any fuel that you have in
your tank of your plane also needs to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid because otherwise you can't fly in
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's with kerosene, that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the same thing when you want
to have replaced kerosene with something
[SPEAKER_02]: more sustainable, you have to make sure
that whatever fuel you're using,
[SPEAKER_02]: it stays liquid at low temperatures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And terpenes check mark that box,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really chill them down to quite
lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're still liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so either by using them purely or by
mixing them in and by that basically also
[SPEAKER_02]: lowering the temperature by which a fuel
solidifies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The freezing or melting point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you can do a mixture or pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually being done already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even the US military, the Air Force has
already done and flown planes on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're using it as an aviation fuel
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course, this is experimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a final applied state,
but it is definitely an idea that is more
[SPEAKER_02]: than just the brainchild of some weird
scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this really has some real world
applications ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically the idea is like,
you know, I mean, we can drive our cars
[SPEAKER_02]: with electricity now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can replace fuel consumptions with
electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully you get that from renewable
sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't fly a plane on electricity,
at least not for very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for distances, you can do,
but international aviation doesn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: with electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's just not doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for certain purposes, you still
need a fuel a chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to do that a little bit
more sustainable, then you have to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And terpenes are one of those things
that's out there sort of in the portfolio
[SPEAKER_02]: of ideas that are currently being
considered and tested out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, bring it back to hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're producing a lot of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it could be in the long run,
an interesting crop where you could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially produce terpenes that then you
could use as a fuel additive there later
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the other ideas or
reasons why we're interested in metabolism
[SPEAKER_02]: of hemp and cannabis, because there could
be completely different applications than
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're thinking about right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that we're going down that
road at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hadn't heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to hear your thoughts on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for sharing and thank you for
your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a better understanding of plant
stress and herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you for the research that
you're doing.
