[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and drawing top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're catching this episode near the
time of release, I wanted to mention two
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming events that I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I will be speaking in the cannabis
breakout sessions at Biocontrol's USA
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference in Portland, Oregon,
March 4th through 6th along with Suzanne
[SPEAKER_00]: Wainwright-Evans and Justin McGill,
two of my former guests on the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up on the website at www
.biocontrolsusa.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other event I want to mention is the
Cultivation Classic, also in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great event for those interested in
organic cannabis cultivation and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to attending and
supporting it again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please check it out at cultivationclassic
.cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Paul Coxon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul has been working with plants since
2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: His love for plants was a lifelong passion
that developed and grew through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska Master Gardener Program and
through his involvement with Huebner's
[SPEAKER_00]: Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul received his Bachelor's of Science
from NC State, during which time he
[SPEAKER_00]: published five journal articles,
received the International Society for
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture Society for Horticulture
Science Young Minds Award, say that 10
[SPEAKER_00]: times fast, published over 20 extension
and outreach publications, and published
[SPEAKER_00]: three e-books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul has a passion for scientific
investigation with the end goal of
[SPEAKER_00]: providing growers and producers with
applicable and impactful production
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul is currently pursuing his Masters of
Science in Horticulture at NC State under
[SPEAKER_00]: the direction of Dr. Brian E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whipker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Paul, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's go ahead and start off giving
listeners a little bit of your background
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you came into this role that you
have at the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have always been interested in plants
ever since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a passion of mine and that
passion just kind of grew and evolved over
[SPEAKER_02]: my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was involved in the Master Gardener
program, went to numerous extension
[SPEAKER_02]: events, and just through kind of a
roundabout way ended up at North Carolina
[SPEAKER_02]: State University and I actually got my
bachelor's here and started working with
[SPEAKER_02]: plants under Dr. Brian Whipker doing
floriculture work with him and continued
[SPEAKER_02]: working with him through my bachelor's and
the opportunity came for me to sign on
[SPEAKER_02]: with a master's for him and I'm currently
a year into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been one wild ride and never expected
to be doing work with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you told me a little bit about that
off air, how you guys applied for a
[SPEAKER_00]: license and were able to get one and have
started doing some research with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or more specifically hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little about some of
the papers that you, there's some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that's happened at your
university?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the way that we got involved in
cannabis is kind of a roundabout story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Whipker and I were just kind of
talking one day in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: just shooting the breeze and I joked with
him and said, hey, let's work in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: because hemp had just become legalized in
our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of laughed at it and then a few
months later he contacted me and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I've just applied for a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing work with hemp and
ever since then it's been just one crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: research project after another and it's
opened a lot of amazing doors for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really glad that we got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as some of the work that we've
done, we got into cannabis and normally
[SPEAKER_02]: when you are looking at researching a new
area, you jump on and you'll do a
[SPEAKER_02]: literature review and look at published
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got on and jumped on Google Scholar and
typed in cannabis sativa and I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: used the all in title function and I got
12 results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was then that I knew that we were
in for one wild ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically had to start at the
foundation as far as research goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we wanted to establish some
baselines for nutrients, for lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: for growing, pH work, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how we got started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go more into the specific projects
that we've done if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you tell us about your first
foray into cannabis research and just for
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners to let them know, I do have one
of your papers in front of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the characterization of nutrient disorders
of cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll probably spend a little more time
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be kind of flying blind on
questions as I don't have the access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other papers at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you want to kind of describe
some of the research that you've done and
[SPEAKER_00]: what some of your findings were,
I'd love to kind of go through that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first things that we did was
starting from the ground up, basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the soil up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two first projects that we started
doing, we were looking at optimal rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: through clonal cuttings because we
realized quickly that sourcing through
[SPEAKER_02]: seed was just not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started clonally propagating
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were experiencing a huge variety of
rooting habits and successes when trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to root cannabis clonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the floriculture industry,
we've had a long time to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: standardize things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that variability that we're seeing
really intrigued us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first two studies we did,
we did a rooting study, and that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: published.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at the use of bottom heat and
also the diameter of the cutting,
[SPEAKER_02]: the caliper, looking at how those two
factors would impact rooting bigger and
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next piece of work that we
did was looking at optimal substrate pHs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in tandem with another lab
here at UNC State doing work there,
[SPEAKER_02]: the substrates lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were kind of the foundation that
we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, we kind of went into
the nutrient deficiency work that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of you, trying to characterize
nutrients and nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've also had another study
published where we went into lighting and
[SPEAKER_02]: photo period a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at daylight extension,
lighting regimes, versus night
[SPEAKER_02]: interruption of lighting regimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I should back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first study that we did was a
baseline hemp nutrients leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: survey, because we had no idea what
optimal nutrients were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we traveled around the state to
different growers' operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took samples off of their plants
and sent them into the lab here,
[SPEAKER_02]: NCDA, and got some values back and
established the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that work has also been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I kind of want to talk about the
findings from each of these, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're all really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's start with what you were just
describing there in surveying and
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing ranges for cannabis using
tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about the methodology of that
and that process and how you determined
[SPEAKER_00]: what a healthy plant looked like?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of those ranges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this was kind of the dirty mucky
science that very few scientists will
[SPEAKER_02]: actually want to reveal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very foundational work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, when you're dealing with
a new crop or a new discovered crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the reasons that we went through
multiple different locations to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: find healthy plants is because fertilizer
types were different, and growing
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions were different, and the
management strategies were different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigation was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that introduced a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to homogenize the
landscape by taking a general survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not to be used as the golden
rule of this is what adequate leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: parts per million looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The survey was just meant to be more of an
informational guideline to growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that these plants, which appeared
healthy and were grown vigorously,
[SPEAKER_02]: had adequate nutrient ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what we can infer from other
crops, they appear to be within the
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that work then kind of springboarded
into the nutrient disorders work,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is getting closer to establishing
fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guidelines for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're saying is you
don't want people to draw too many
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions from your preliminary work
there, that paper, other than to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there may be a possible range here of
elements in the tissue that may allow you
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow what appears to be a healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So science is a very additive process,
and the more and more experiments you do
[SPEAKER_02]: in a specific research direction or
research question, they begin to add
[SPEAKER_02]: together to form the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, then you can start
inferring and making guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting close with some of the
work that we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, cannabis is still very
new for research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're still just beginning to gain
traction with the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point that
you're making there, so that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: consider how this may point them in sort
of a direction of a trend, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still so much research that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you were talking about an
established crop like corn, you'd find
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of papers just on nitrogen that
could discuss this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of tissue work that's been done
across a variety of different scenarios
[SPEAKER_00]: and environments to where you can start
really drawing strong correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just don't have any of that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still very preliminary,
like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have Dr. Kaplan, Darren Kaplan on
from the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did work with Dr. Zang on propagation
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know, did your work come
before or after their paper, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: released in, I think, May of 2018?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any correlation there or
anything that you found that sort of fit
[SPEAKER_00]: or didn't fit with the work that they did?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kaplan's work came before ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours was just published at the end of,
I believe it was 2018 is when ours came
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his work came before ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the correlations between the
two works, there were some similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, we were also
exploring slightly different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, he used rooting hormones in
his work and we did not look at rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were looking more at the caliper and
bottom heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say caliper, just for people
who may not be familiar with the term,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about the measurement of
the diameter of the stem.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say caliper, you're measuring
the caliper in terms of the rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: success of that particular cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, in flower culture,
when you're trying to establish a more
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous cutting, a vegetative cutting,
you'll apply heat to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tray or bottom of the bench or close to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that increases the temperature of the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is it helps speed up
the rooting process in some species.
[SPEAKER_02]: In others, it will have little to no
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to explore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other area that we were
exploring is the caliper, which when you
[SPEAKER_02]: take a tip cutting from another stock
plant and you kind of take the tip portion
[SPEAKER_02]: and you point it away from yourself and
you look at the end that you cut it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you were to measure the diameter of
that, that would be the caliper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the theory was that a thicker caliper
could potentially have more surface area
[SPEAKER_02]: for the callus to increase root
proliferation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a thicker caliper could also
potentially have more reserves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more photosynthates, et cetera,
that the plant could draw on to help with
[SPEAKER_02]: the healing and rooting process was kind
of the line of thinking that we went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did your research support your
hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we found was that we divided
calipers into three different sizes,
[SPEAKER_02]: small, medium, and large, as far as the
caliper was concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did find that there was a
statistically significant difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting between the small caliper and the
large caliper, but not between the small
[SPEAKER_02]: and the medium or the medium and the large
caliper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that means is that when we
actually looked at the date of rooting,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bigger rooting, and we actually then
screened the rootings through a visual
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, that the larger caliper produced
more vigorous roots when compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: small caliper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say large, I assume you're
still talking about fairly immature
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that cannabis can develop a
woodier stem over time, which appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit cloning or propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about how you
established your experiment and what you
[SPEAKER_00]: really were comparing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, how we kind of
went along the lines of exploring how to
[SPEAKER_02]: quantify the size of the cutting or the
caliper, we actually went in to mother
[SPEAKER_02]: stock plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took some other stock plants and we
took vegetative cuttings off of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paper goes into a little more
detail on how we quantified that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't bore you with the details here,
but we divided all of the cuttings,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of did a survey and looked at the
different calipers and the different
[SPEAKER_02]: caliper pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, we came up with the sizes
that we used for our study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the small size was 1.7 to 2
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medium size was 2.3 to 2.6 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the large caliper was 2.9 to 3.2
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of the general process
of how we approached categorizing what a
[SPEAKER_02]: typical caliper would be on our mother
stock plants that we were managing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then how we divided them up for the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, did you look at where on the plant
itself that the cutting was taken from in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of from near the top of the plant,
near the base of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that something that was factored in at
all in this particular study?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we only took from secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what that means is you have
the central stock from which all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: branches come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's considered the primary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so any branch that comes off of that
would be secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any consecutive branch that comes off of
that would be tertiary, so on and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the paper, which is
freely available through Murray State
[SPEAKER_02]: University, the Journal of Agricultural
Hemp Research, has a wonderful diagram in
[SPEAKER_02]: there on how we actually took the cuttings
and quantified the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as looking at, say,
an interior canopy cutting versus an
[SPEAKER_02]: exterior canopy cutting, we were only
taking shoot tips from the exterior
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by a shoot tip is only the
terminal growing portion of a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it terminated in a growing tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you weren't you weren't taking more
than one cutting off of that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, you could go down another
few inches and take another cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't do that for this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any other findings from this
particular study that you wanted to share
[SPEAKER_00]: besides what you just shared regarding
larger caliper rooting better than smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: caliper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, there was a statistically
significant difference between these small
[SPEAKER_02]: caliper and the large caliper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the percentage of cuttings
that had rooted at 14 days versus 28 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a statistical difference in this
study between adding root zone heating or
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom heating versus not utilizing bottom
heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was another interesting finding
from the study, rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your control temperature and then
what did you raise it to with the roots on
[SPEAKER_00]: to with the bottom heating and how
statistically significant are we talking
[SPEAKER_00]: across adding that heat matter or heat
source?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the what we did is we measured the
substrate temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the substrate temperature was twenty
seven point eight degrees centigrade
[SPEAKER_02]: without root zone heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was sorry, that was with root
zone heating and the average temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: was twenty five point six degrees
centigrade without.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we increased the root zone temperature
by roughly two degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, just to save all of us Americans who
are terrible at Celsius, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this calculation for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So twenty eight point seven Celsius is
eighty three point six six degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was your heated temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your sorry, what was the control
again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry, that's twenty seven point
eight degrees centigrade for the
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the treatment was twenty seven points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eighty two degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the control, it was twenty
five point six degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or seventy eight degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so not a dramatic rise in temperature,
but you still found statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant, statistically significant
better rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually surprising to me that I
would that just that few degrees could
[SPEAKER_00]: raise your rooting success that that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when when doing a study like this,
you don't want to raise the temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the root zone temperature too much because
you don't want to potentially desiccate or
[SPEAKER_02]: damage any roots that are forming or even
the callus as it forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the temperature differential
wasn't overly large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I would have thought that maybe
the control temperature might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: lower rather than the heated temperature
be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we this experiment was conducted
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were in a poly house and the cooling
coefficient on a poly house is much less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the temperatures were a
little higher for the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to another one of the
papers that you mentioned prior to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prior to talking about this
nutrient disorder paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, are you the substrate pH work,
the other one that we did kind of on that
[SPEAKER_02]: ground up approach, we're still in the
process of publishing that paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one has not been released yet,
but those results will be forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we do dive right into the
nutrient, nutrient disorder paper that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote or co-authored.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you talked about with
this paper was that you guys really are a
[SPEAKER_00]: team there at the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any anything you want to mention
prior to starting talking about or did you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to kind of as we go through the
paper, mention the people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in different aspects of this
work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our lab, we have been really blessed
to have a group of fantastic researchers
[SPEAKER_02]: and collaborators that we've worked with
on all of these projects, both the
[SPEAKER_02]: projects that we have completed,
have published and are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, Gabby Brahas, Patrick Veazey,
David Logan, Matthew Davis, Kimberly
[SPEAKER_02]: McCallister, our collaborator,
Dr. Nichelle Schroeder-Moreno,
[SPEAKER_02]: our other collaborator, Dr. Brian Jackson
and my major professor, Dr. Brian Whitker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all form a fantastic team of
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these people have been involved on
all the projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others are collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some projects, but research definitely
does not take place in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the research process goes,
we've been really blessed to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing collaborators and people in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really does take a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to recognize
that when you see a name on a paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the full story of the work that
went into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for highlighting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this paper itself, it's called
Characterization of Nutrient Disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a paper that was published by the
researchers of Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought to my attention recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it only was published in October
18th of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give a quick highlight or
sort of a rough idea of what the abstract
[SPEAKER_00]: was with this paper and what your goals
were when you first started doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, the first paper that we
published was that general survey paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one is published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's meant to be kind of a shotgun
approach to guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these were the ranges we saw in
multiple different cultivars across
[SPEAKER_02]: different growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is trying to be a little more
targeted and kind of narrow in on optimal
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility recommendations for hemp and
trying to figure out what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility cannabis plants need in order to
balance the nutrient cost input to growers
[SPEAKER_02]: and maximize the, you know, CVD content,
flower content, depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this specific work, we were looking
at nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is we were trying to
stress the plants down to a level where we
[SPEAKER_02]: could visually see symptoms of nutrient
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could take foliar leaf tissue
and send that off to a lab and compare
[SPEAKER_02]: that to plants that we grew with a
complete fertility regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that complete fertility regime is
based off of what's called a modified
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoagland solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a standard hydroponic water soluble
nutrient fertilizer regime that basically
[SPEAKER_02]: balances all of the cations and anions and
is supposed to provide a plant with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as it's macro and micronutrients
are concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to withhold an element
from a plant from that recipe to induce
[SPEAKER_02]: our deficiency and then compare those
visual symptoms and the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis back to that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant that received everything
was our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there research out there showing
success and growing with this Hoagland
[SPEAKER_00]: solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or formula with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were you kind of going into a little
bit of new territory with that in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling from other crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Whitker, myself, numerous other
scientists have used the solution to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide fertility for a wide array of
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as specific to cannabis,
no, we were the first to kind of pioneer a
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoagland solution with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the general literature is
concerned, it has been tested on numerous
[SPEAKER_02]: different plants, numerous different
crops, and proved to be adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just out of curiosity, so as you
started growing with this Hoagland
[SPEAKER_00]: solution as this baseline for fertility,
just anecdotally you found that it seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be providing appropriate nutrient
levels across the board for macro and
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so kind of how the research logic goes
is we took a broad survey approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our first paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we kind of wanted to see what
would happen if we took away a singular
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient from the plant and what that
would do to the leaf tissue values
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the survey that we had and
what that would do to the control plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that was receiving adequate fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been proven to be adequate for
multiple different crop species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then currently what we're doing,
and I know we're getting off track a bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but currently we are then modifying the
Hoagland solution for all macro and
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients at different rates to try
and get a fuller leaf tissue curve,
[SPEAKER_02]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from, say, like zero parts per million
to 2.5, so on and so forth, to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: establish a curve for fertility as far as
fuller analyses are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just kind of curious where you
came up with this for a baseline for your
[SPEAKER_00]: control, because I think that's important
for people to understand when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what you're removing,
it's good to know where you were starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into a little bit of the
methodology here, but just I had a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of things in the introduction that you
guys mentioned in terms of relating back
[SPEAKER_00]: to prior work that had been done that I
thought was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something you can touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just something that pretty much
the sentences that you put in there say at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of want to bring him bring him
out in hemp fiber in hemp fiber varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bosca et al reported higher levels of
nitrogen increased plant leaf weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased leaf THC content, presumably due
to THC dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that work in particular, like I said,
once when I actually went into this and
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing a literature review and trying
to get a good feel for the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: research that had been done, there was not
much out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this introduction is quite bare bones
when it comes to a normal introduction and
[SPEAKER_02]: literature review.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially what we're trying to say
there, and I think what the article was
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get out is first, I would like
to draw your attention to the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a fiber variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were growing a high CBD clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the growth habit and growth parameters
are different for fiber varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want them to be very tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to plant them very densely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in a field condition typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CBD varieties that we were
growing, you want those big, beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more compact.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were grown in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially what we're trying to get
at here is to draw on previous work
[SPEAKER_02]: showing that nitrogen increased the total
production of leaf biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important when looking at leaf
tissue analyses because you're comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: how much nitrogen is in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a larger leaf, you can potentially
have a dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that increased plant size could
have resulted in a THC dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a larger bud but the same
amount of THC in it, because most things
[SPEAKER_02]: are calculated off of a percentage dry
weight, you can have an artificially low
[SPEAKER_02]: dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I am unsure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't recall off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which methodology they actually used to
test THC in this study, whether it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage dry weight or percentage
concentration, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be really interesting for
people in growing hemp that are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay below a given THC percentage in order
to have a legal crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to see more research coming
out on that around nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any research at this point is just
going to help that additive scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: effect so that we can get a clearer
picture for what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one other thing I wanted to ask you
about was at the end of your introduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned that no visual guides of
nutrient deficiency in cannabis supported
[SPEAKER_00]: with leaf tissue analysis in documenting a
progression of symptomology have been
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're saying there is
when I go online on Google Images and type
[SPEAKER_00]: in nitrogen deficiency cannabis or
whatever particular element I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, there's no research that's been
published that actually correlates that
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tissue test, a leaf tissue analysis
to show that that truly is the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with symptomology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know and have seen and was
able to tease out in the work that I did,
[SPEAKER_02]: there have been some leaf tissue analyses
reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the plant analysis handbook has
some tissue values for cannabis Tiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as correlating those visual
symptoms with an actual leaf tissue test,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I mean by actually correlating,
I don't mean just providing low fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had withheld nitrogen from the
plant, the plant received no nitrogen of
[SPEAKER_02]: any form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can say with relative certainty that
the symptomology that we saw based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf tissue analysis is truly nitrogen
deficiency because the plant received
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely no nitrogen fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's dive right into nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get in too much into your
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there in the paper if people want
to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems fairly straightforward to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk about what your findings
were related to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally, when you think of
nitrogen deficiencies, you think of a
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing on the lower leaves,
the plants putting more energy into its
[SPEAKER_00]: upper leaves, lighter greening over all of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have some actual photos here
so people can see initial, intermediate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and advanced stages of nitrogen
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you talk a little about those
findings relating to nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So exploring nutrient deficiencies is kind
of a fun I guess you could call it a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a puzzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain elements within plants are mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means is the plant has the
ability to remove those from certain
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues and portions and translocate them
to other portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, nitrogen is noble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is when the plant is
nitrogen stressed, it will draw nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: from those lower leaves, which is why we
kind of drew upon the fact that the
[SPEAKER_02]: symptomology developed first on the lower
portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will translate, locate that to the
other portions of the plant that need that
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the meristematic region as
it's developing new leaves and putting on
[SPEAKER_02]: new shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, typical symptomology of
nitrogen deficiency is going to be that
[SPEAKER_02]: yellowing or paling specifically at the
lower foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other elements that we looked at are
immobile, which means you're going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: symptomology on the newer leaves,
shoots, newer portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point regarding
mobile and immobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: How related is that to the hydrology in
terms of your watering habits in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mobility or nutrients that are
immobile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole flow and dynamics and flux of
nutrients within the plant is much more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated than we went into in this
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we're trying to get some more
foundational knowledge out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, so for example, some plants are
taken up by the plant through a process
[SPEAKER_02]: called mass flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very much related to how much
water essentially the roots can absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: into the plant and get those nutrients in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's other ways that the plant
can obtain nutrients, scavenge nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as for this study, all of the
plants were on an automatic irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: system and received the same amount of
liquid at the same intervals throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that changed was which
nutrients we were supplying to those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I want to point out
before we dive too far into any one
[SPEAKER_00]: element or nutrient here is in a
traditional cannabis growing environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see multiple symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's not ever just a nitrogen
deficiency or a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually related to your watering or
your environment, humidity, your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, your lighting intensity,
insect pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope listeners will keep that in mind
when they're utilizing a guide like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not as simple as just picking
out one of the photos and saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks the closest to like my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a little more history
into how that plant's being grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to throw in that little
caveat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to it, when you talk about
nitrogen, one of your findings was the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grown in nitrogen deficient
conditions produce 50 percent less biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: when compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was an interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be able to grow as as
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you didn't find that across all of the
different elements that you were testing
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything in relation to
nitrogen that you want to touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have done numerous nutrient
efficiency studies with multiple different
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this trend of dry weights being
variable in their statistical significance
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of holds true across most of those
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is just dependent on the
plants and how they uptake nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: how they utilize those nutrients,
their growth habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can imagine something that
stays in a rosette form is going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: very different nutrient needs and
utilizations than something that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: very upright and leggy growth habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as nitrogen is concerned,
we expected to see a statistical
[SPEAKER_02]: significance between no nitrogen and
nitrogen supplied treatments, specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: because nitrogen is a macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means is the plants uses
more nitrogen and other macronutrients in
[SPEAKER_02]: greater quantities than, say, the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both macro and micro are still needed by
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the amounts that they need,
it needs much, much, much more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: than, say, even phosphorus or potassium or
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the reasons why there
was such a strong statistically
[SPEAKER_02]: significant decrease in plant dry weight
when compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this test, you were just dealing
with vegetative plants, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never really looked at cannabinoid
content, THC percentage, any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: The current work that we're doing,
we are looking at, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nutrient rates for all macro and
micronutrients across the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: different life stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the experiment that we are doing now is
we're looking at leaf tissue nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then, again, sample once we have turned
off our lighting and initiated those
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter days to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we harvest at brief flower,
which is typically a week to two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: after we shut our lights off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're waiting until they go into
full flower maturity, which we're
[SPEAKER_02]: targeting about eight weeks for full
flower maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're, again, sampling leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting this nice, not only
nutrient rate curve, but also total plant
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle and how the nutrients are
changing, accumulating, moving within the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't an uptake study or a
translocation study.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nutrient rate study over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, there's this additive
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the next step that we're
going on to, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that'll be really
interesting because it's fairly easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to grow a healthy vegetative
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you get further into flower,
as the plant starts senescing,
[SPEAKER_00]: any particular stress, I think,
becomes much, much more apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though as we move through some of
these elements in your study here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you note that there isn't statistical
significance in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we move into flower,
that'll become a lot more apparent in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of those deficiencies reflecting
either a loss of THC or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages or terpene values or even
overall yield of flower biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to see that work as
you guys come out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of going back to what you were
saying with the statistically not the
[SPEAKER_02]: statistical non-significance in the plant
dry weights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, for phosphorus,
while we did not see a statistical
[SPEAKER_02]: significance in dry weight between the
plants that did not receive phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the plants that did, you can look
at the leaf tissue values and see that
[SPEAKER_02]: they were statistically significant,
very statistically significant actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though that phosphorus treatment
may not have produced a smaller plant per
[SPEAKER_02]: se, it definitely had less phosphorus,
which means that it will be stressed and
[SPEAKER_02]: won't be as healthy and consequently could
potentially produce a bud that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm of the opinion that most growers
over apply phosphorus in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious, are you gonna look at what
sort of what sufficiency levels are needed
[SPEAKER_00]: for phosphorus in flower versus the
overabundance that I think is applied
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the cannabis industry in
general when it comes to phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we'll be looking
at is when we take that final leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be looking at,
okay, at the end of the plant's life,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much phosphorus did it accumulate over
these different rates?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we will also be looking at
cannabinoids, cannabinoids, however you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to say it, and how that can
potentially relate back to the different
[SPEAKER_02]: rates that we're applying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, in our phosphorus provided
at let's say hypothetically 10 parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million, what would that bud total dry
mass be?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what would also be the level of
THC or CBD or CBG in that flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have you back on once you
have gotten a little further along and
[SPEAKER_00]: publish that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like that's the next nutrient
that you talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice that you put in dolomite lime
into your substrate to get some calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: and magnesium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that and then also what
your findings were with calcium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the rooting substrate that we use,
because these were vegetative cuttings,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, some of that did have dolomitic lime
amended in it, but those levels would be
[SPEAKER_02]: negligible on the scale that we're looking
at, especially as the plants continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and there's more biomass and
consequently less calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that in the statistically
significant results from the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration that we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as symptomology for calcium
goes, calcium is an immobile element.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're looking to see calcium
stress or deficiency on your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be looking at the growing
tips, the newly expanded leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: the portions of the plants that are
actively growing and expanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So calcium, the plant isn't able to
requisition any calcium reserves from old
[SPEAKER_02]: cells or old plant parts and translocate
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why you're looking at these new
portions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing with calcium is that
it's involved in cell wall stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what happens when a plant
goes through a calcium deficiency is it
[SPEAKER_02]: cannot adequately develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll see this severe distortion and
stunting that we saw and you can see in
[SPEAKER_02]: the photos as they progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the reasons that we were
able to see such beautiful, I say
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful, but if you're seeing the
symptomology, it's not beautiful when it
[SPEAKER_02]: grew up, but beautiful symptomology that
we induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very apparent, which I think is what
you're referring to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is great to see and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like it had a lot of light
stress, I think in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was quite shocked with just how dramatic
it is because it's funny because in the
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas industry, there's sort of this old
mantra that if your plant looks at all
[SPEAKER_00]: sick or deficient, you just apply Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of become a running joke in
the canvas industry of just put more Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Mag on that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, I think it's rare we see
these sorts of calcium deficiencies that
[SPEAKER_00]: do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I don't see them as much with the
growers that I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to see more nitrogen or potassium
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I really like seeing those
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else about calcium that
you wanted to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're kind of describing a
little bit of how these nutrients work in
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant because I think that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're OK with it, let's move on to
sulfur and you can talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to touch on one more thing
on calcium real quick.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So calcium and boron will have very
similar symptomology and they're both
[SPEAKER_02]: immobile elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the reasons, and we have
completed the micronutrients experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: run for that nutrient rates by life cycle
portions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can talk a little bit about some of
the symptomology and results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not true results yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't run statistics on the full
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because cannabis, once it initiates
its reproductive phase, that growing tip
[SPEAKER_02]: will become the flowering portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium and boron are extremely important
in that development because when they
[SPEAKER_02]: finally initiate the reproductive cycle
and start producing that flower bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be at that growing tip that
you see across the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do have calcium or boron
deficiencies, you will not have a properly
[SPEAKER_02]: developing flower bud because you won't
have a properly developing and expanding
[SPEAKER_02]: growing region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we saw that with our boron plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had almost no flowers produced on our
boron zero rate once we initiated
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering just because the plant was
physiologically incapable of expanding and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing because it did not have the
structural components needed to build
[SPEAKER_02]: those cells and expand those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can go and view these photos to
see what Paul's describing here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great photos associated with
every one of these elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wanted to move on to sulfur next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just keep working our way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for sulfur, again, it was one of those
elements where we did not see a
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant difference in
the dry weight between the plants that did
[SPEAKER_02]: not receive any sulfur versus the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when you actually look at the
leaf tissue concentration, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plants that received no sulfur had
much, much lower leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations than plants that received
an adequate level of sulfur fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I want to kind of go back to
what you said a bit earlier on making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you take a holistic approach to
diagnostics in your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great that you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf tissue analysis is just one way of
trying to tease out problems that you may
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you said, it's this holistic
approach that you have to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be another abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be ozone damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be water stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking those leaf tissue concentrations
from your plant, actually going in,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking the leaf tissue sample,
sending it off to a lab, ensuring that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do that and that the lab is licensed
and that the laws and legalities in your
[SPEAKER_02]: state allow you to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To gain this information will be extremely
valuable if you think you have a nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always want to go that extra step if
possible and check to ensure that what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing visually is also reflected
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an interesting topic because
because cannabis is federally illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot ship any leaf samples,
even if they're of a vegetative plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: zero THC content in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most cannabis facilities are very
limited in their ability to do tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we do is soil testing
because we're primarily working with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil growers where we have certain
levels of mineral content in every soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that we're working with or native
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a matter of trying to
balance those based off of like a Malik 3
[SPEAKER_00]: test, which is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fully aware of that, but it's one of
the limitations within cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least from a facility perspective,
because we are limited not only just in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to mail leaf samples to reach
a lab, to even find a lab that's willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at a cannabis sample and then also
just the cost associated with testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses is really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that the university is doing
work like this to at least allow growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to have access to some of this
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great insight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're learning as much as we
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, the exchanges that we get
with growers and the kind of challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're experiencing, it only helps
us do better research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows, maybe down the road,
we're going to look at possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: correlating some of the nutrient work that
we're doing to some of those soil tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's researchers out there
who do a lot of work with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they jump up the opportunity
to do some work like that if it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd love to see more correlation
there between like the Malik 3 and
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste tests with these tissue
tests so we can have a better idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient availability in these soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the other challenge there too is
how much of those nutrients are really
[SPEAKER_00]: available to a plant and how well is the
biology at cycling those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about organic systems,
there's so many variables involved that it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a long time
before we have all those answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by using chemical nutrients or mineral
salts like you guys are, you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: able to isolate out these various minerals
or nutrients, which really makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in seeing these symptoms so
that we can still apply some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge towards our more complex organic
soil systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I will say with sulfur that
I see is I tend to see it in very high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in organic soils, primarily because
people either applying sulfates or gypsum
[SPEAKER_00]: as a way of mitigating the alkalinity of a
lot of the cations in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to see like excessively high
sulfur levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, from all the research I've found,
it's very hard to reach sulfur toxicity in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils or more specifically in cannabis
plants to where I haven't really seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been one of the best tools for
lowering pH that I've found in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you would touch on
regarding that comment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very difficult to produce a
sulfur toxicity without going too much
[SPEAKER_02]: into the details.
[SPEAKER_02]: The physiology of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, the plant is very good at
requisitioning, utilizing or excluding
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur within the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that you can see and some things
that have come out of literature is that
[SPEAKER_02]: elevated sulfur levels, just like any
other element being elevated above others
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil profile can potentially
impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will qualify that by saying can
potentially impact the microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: community, especially in say an organic
system like what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at how those microbes can take
those nutrients and turn them into a
[SPEAKER_02]: mineralized form that is plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: That relationship between the organic
matter, the microbes and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: production of those mineral plants
available forms is a very important
[SPEAKER_02]: network and web to be maintaining and
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down the road, maybe there could be more
work done specifically with regard to
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and say elevated sulfur levels
and nutrient cycling and organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to see regarding sulfur
is information on how sulfur impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about sulfur, it comes in a
lot of different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about a sulfate form,
we talk about potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium sulfate in the case of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears to have, and this is anecdotal,
very little minor impact on overall soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology and nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard when using agricultural sulfur,
which is associated with lowering pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can have a more dramatic impact on soil
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen enough research and I
haven't seen enough data to really show
[SPEAKER_00]: how much sulfur would need to be added to
lower a pH level this much in a given
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of soil and how that impacts soil
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that I would love answers
to down the road or if that research
[SPEAKER_00]: exists, someone send it to me because I
haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some research like that would be
fantastic, especially with regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: organic forms of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, there's definitely very
much need for more information to help
[SPEAKER_02]: perpetuate that additive scientific
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but let's go back and why don't you
tell us a little bit more about magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got off topic there for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnesium is involved with chlorophyll and
essentially what a plant will do when a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant experiences magnesium deficiency,
chlorophyll essentially doesn't function
[SPEAKER_02]: in the way that it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means for the plant is if you
have a magnesium deficiency, the
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic activity of the plant could
be much lower and that will impact the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources and photosynthates that the
plant has and is able to then throw at the
[SPEAKER_02]: developing bud and other developing
portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it in a typical life
cycle, every organism wants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in plants, as you touched on,
a lot of times with the reproductive stage
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant, you'll experience much more
pronounced stressors and that will be when
[SPEAKER_02]: you start seeing those symptomologies for
nutrient deficiencies or other stresses
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant may be experiencing because
it's dumping so many of those resources
[SPEAKER_02]: into that developing flower bud with the
end goal of trying to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially magnesium, you can potentially
have huge impacts to your yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, like I said, we have not explored
the full rates and life cycle analysis yet
[SPEAKER_02]: of this element throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those that you want to keep a
specific eye on given its importance to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant health overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also touching on the symptomology by
location on the leaf and how it develops
[SPEAKER_02]: and progresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnesium and potassium deficiency
symptomologies are very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding that leaf anatomy and how it
progresses is important in the visual
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnostic checklist that you go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, in an ideal world, we would
identify nutrient deficiency early before
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets to these advanced stages so that
we don't have to wait until we see
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced symptomology to determine
magnesium versus potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm excited to talk about potassium
because I think potassium is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important elements when we're talking
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the data to support this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hundreds of soil tests I've looked
at relating to overall plant growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't had any plant tissue
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trend that I think I'm seeing is that
potassium deficiencies occur at a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rate in cannabis, as in they need
more potassium than most agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think potassium has a high correlation
with bud density and overall weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially talking yield based on the
soil tests that I see correlating with
[SPEAKER_00]: plant soils that appear to be K deficient
or even just K sufficient, like barely
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient tend to produce lower yield and
lower weight and overall lower yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: lower bud density than plants that have
what most would consider an excess of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to have you talk on it and
also talk about what your findings were
[SPEAKER_00]: with potassium in this particular paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about potassium,
especially with regards to say a soil
[SPEAKER_02]: profile as opposed to some of the soluble
fertilizers that we were using here,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it's a monovalent ion which means it
essentially has a charge, a positive
[SPEAKER_02]: charge, a singular positive charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically what happens, say you have a
heavy rain event, those monovalent ions
[SPEAKER_02]: will be leached through the soil profile
more readily than say your divalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that potassium can move into a
plant relatively easily, but it also moves
[SPEAKER_02]: through the soil profile relatively easily
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a side note.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the research findings that
we found, we also found that limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium had a huge impact on the,
obviously it had an impact on how much
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium was taken into the plant because
there was none supplied.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it was supplied, the potassium
levels were quite high in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we referenced our survey values in the
paper as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were within the reference values
that we had in our initial study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would agree with you that more work
definitely needs to be done in potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as its role in bud developments and
et cetera, as you touched upon,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm uncomfortable addressing that given we
have not yet explored the potassium rates
[SPEAKER_02]: in the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we do, that's definitely
something that I will be specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for and comparing in our study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see that because what I,
so I'll get from a grower, a malic three
[SPEAKER_00]: test for example, at the beginning of the
growth cycle and then one at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find is in terms of how far the
nutrients have dropped in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and potassium are the two that
typically appear to drop the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you mentioned, they are very
mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be being leached out of the
soil from a flooding event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the guys that we're working
with too are using blue mats, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially an automated watering system
that only waters as that soil dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's controlled through osmotic
pressure by the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tend to not have a lot of
leaching going on through that bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, if nothing's leaching out
the bottom of the bed, then that potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: is being taken up into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see potassium levels drop to
let's say around 5% or lower of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: cation exchange, CEC of the total plant or
sorry, total of what's available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, I start to see smaller buds,
lower yield, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to see research on that and
see what really is going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the leaf tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to keep that in mind when
looking at the study when we run the
[SPEAKER_02]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we ran the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have yet to run the macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to talk more with you just off
air about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually very fascinating,
especially if they're using a blue mat
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could potentially mean, well,
we can talk later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can speculate about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you hearing me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to your micronutrient
disorders because you had some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, one of the nutrients that
I'd like to specifically highlight would
[SPEAKER_02]: be boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that is involved in the
essentially cell wall development and
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so especially if you experience a
boron deficiency and then you're close to
[SPEAKER_02]: your initiation of reproduction and you
don't remedy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, one thing that we saw is we
have little to no flower bud formation due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fact that the meristematic region
was not able to properly develop and
[SPEAKER_02]: expand into the developing flower bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as I guess we can talk about
copper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a specific one that you wanted
to address?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think the overview you're giving is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just caution listeners that when
we're talking about these micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about very, very small
amounts, typically parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a lot of boron for a plant
to be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go out there and buy borax and
apply a bunch to your soil and think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fixing a deficiency because you'll
probably kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to highlight that for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about micronutrients,
we're talking about typically pretty small
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of nutrient that's actually needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a fantastic point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to add to that in this experiment,
we added a boron toxicity treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially what we did is we took that
modified Hoagland solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took the boron levels and we increased
them tenfold of what the Hoagland solution
[SPEAKER_02]: requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did that with manganese as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we do that is because we
often see, like you said, it's very easy
[SPEAKER_02]: to over apply a micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also wanted to try and capture some
of those toxicity symptomologies because
[SPEAKER_02]: not every nutrient issue that you run into
will be a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you're over applying something
or something is too available or the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is taking up too much of something or
another element may be in such high
[SPEAKER_02]: quantities that it's causing another
element to be plant unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting, I'm looking
through these photos right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initial boron toxicity looks almost
exactly like your initial potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's interesting for people
because I've seen people walk into a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room, look at a plant and immediately say,
oh, that's nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that always makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are there's so many
variables associated with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of especially in soils,
a lot of your nutrient deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_00]: excesses can be related to hydrology or
the way that you're watering by just under
[SPEAKER_00]: watering your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause a lot of nutrient
deficiencies because the microbes aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cycle nutrients effectively due to
a lack of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or or due to lack of osmotic pressure,
move those nutrients throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really important to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're we're on the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find one of the most helpful things you
can ask any grower of any crop is first
[SPEAKER_02]: and foremost for a crop history,
because most of the times you're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is an issue that was
created some time in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now manifesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a fantastic point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad to see that there's other
people out there who are stopping and
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking and taking a more holistic
approach to diagnosing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you want to touch
on regarding the manganese or boron
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicities that you saw or either of those
elements in general in relation to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or plant health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I will say is when looking at
toxicities and you can see this in the
[SPEAKER_02]: photos and I hope that this photo also
gets posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listeners can reference it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will often see that toxicity
symptomology, regardless of element,
[SPEAKER_02]: follows a very specific progression where
you see that marginal chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that yellowing of the margin first and
then it will progress to the marginal
[SPEAKER_02]: necrosis, which is that burning or that
the browning of the leaf margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that and you can see that
in the comparison image that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: between manganese toxicity and boron
toxicity, that the marginal symptomology
[SPEAKER_02]: is very pronounced in almost any toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of as a side note,
being careful and cautious when dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the leaf margin, especially if it's
going chlorotic or necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's excellent advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't something I was aware of or
had really ever thought of, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I think of toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you pointed that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to touch on, did you want to
move on to what looks like iron and zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: were the next two in your paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can move on to iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, as I stated, magnesium toxicity
or magnesium deficiency, manganese
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency, iron deficiency, they all kind
of have this interveinal chlorosis
[SPEAKER_02]: symptom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, symptoms that develop on the
foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, doing work like this,
we're trying as best we can to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: these criteria and checklists,
both visually and with leaf tissue to help
[SPEAKER_02]: people diagnose things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times the symptomologies are
very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being careful that when you're looking
at these, that you're taking, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: a holistic approach and trying to utilize
the tools that are available to you to
[SPEAKER_02]: help that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, iron deficiency, again,
you'll get this severe interveinal
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorosis in those more advanced symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you know, we can identify
and remedy iron before it gets to this
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But letting the plants go out this far,
that's one of the reasons that we allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants to grow in these deficient
conditions for so long so that we'd have
[SPEAKER_02]: that gradient of beginning intermediate
and advanced symptomology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as iron is concerned,
it is another immobile element.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this particular element,
if you're seeing symptomology on the new
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding leaves, the growing portions,
the portions of the plant that are
[SPEAKER_02]: actively growing, this is where you're
going to be seeing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: interveinal chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at where on the plant these
symptoms are occurring will help you
[SPEAKER_02]: identify and, you know, kind of utilize
that as a checklist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is this iron or is this,
you know, a mobile element?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some wonderful charts online
that you all can utilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look at nutrient mobility in
plants, it will tell you which,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some charts out there that have,
you know, categorized mobile elements
[SPEAKER_02]: versus immobile elements and will help you
identify more it's a tool, a diagnostic
[SPEAKER_02]: tool that you can utilize to figure out
which element you may be experiencing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which nutrient may be limiting in your
fertility regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to touch on regarding
zinc or I see you mentioned even
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum, I have done zero work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know much about it overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to share in
particular relating to either of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we utilized molybdenum because it is
a plant essential micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as plants that often display
symptomology and molybdenum deficiency,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, molybdenum is more
important for nodulating plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants that will form associations with
bacteria to form root nodules to fix
[SPEAKER_02]: atmospheric nitrogen, such as your
lagoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, poinsettias, poinsettias
will often display molybdenum deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of threw it in just for fun to
kind of see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, and you can look at the
composite picture, not much symptomology
[SPEAKER_02]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did not have statistically
significant differences in dry weights,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though we did receive a statistically
significant difference in leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically there was more molybdenum in
the leaf tissue in your treatment versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that didn't display visually or
in terms of your overall biomass when you
[SPEAKER_00]: measured the two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like from what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will say is because we use
things like kelp meal and rock dust,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never really worried about
molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure we're picking some up through
those because they contain some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be curious to see as you move
through flower, looking at molybdenum if
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to see statistically significant
differences in overall yield or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content, that might be
interesting because I'd like to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: start playing around with the addition of
molybdenum to see if it has any real
[SPEAKER_00]: growth impact or plant health impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's definitely something that
we'll be looking at with regard to our
[SPEAKER_02]: statistical analysis on the micronutrient
study that we just completed, the rate
[SPEAKER_02]: over lifecycle experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these micronutrients, it's going to
be very interesting to see what happens
[SPEAKER_02]: with the different rates over the life
cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you covered all my
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the discussion explains
some of your findings, which really fits
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we already covered most of that
just in our discussion of the elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was there anything else you wanted to
add regarding this research before we sign
[SPEAKER_00]: off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just again, to reiterate that one of the
most valuable things you can do whenever
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at a problem is utilizing
the tools that you have available to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at what you did in the past to try
and figure out is, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: you used water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I providing enough water and is that
causing a nutrient issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: De facto, or did I apply something that
may now be interacting in a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: effect in the soil profile and causing
another element to be plant unavailable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this work, we're still in a
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning, we're producing science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an additive process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visual symptomology is correlated to leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: These pictures are very helpful and
useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, some of the symptomology is
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the progression of the
symptomology, comparing that to the
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures, and then also looking at where
on the plant those symptoms are occurring
[SPEAKER_02]: will be extremely useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing further research
out of your university and you personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for your time today
and I look forward to staying in touch and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully we'll get to have you or
someone, one of your colleagues back on
[SPEAKER_00]: soon to talk about some of the latest
research and some of your findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're definitely very excited for a
lot of the research we're doing and
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely even more excited to continue
talking with growers and producers to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the needs that they have as far
as research is concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much a two-way street.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the industry needs and does and the
issues that they're experiencing help us
[SPEAKER_02]: do better research that's more applicable
and helps the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bilateral exchange is extremely
important and definitely is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to continue in greater quantity for
all researchers that are going to be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: work in hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Paul Coxton and you were
listening to the Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
