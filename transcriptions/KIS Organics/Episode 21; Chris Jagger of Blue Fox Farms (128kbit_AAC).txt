[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to subscribe to the podcast
and leave us a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also sign up for our newsletters
on our website as it's the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out when new episodes and blog posts
[SPEAKER_01]: come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thanks Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wanted to start off giving
listeners a little bit of your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I have Blue Fox Farm in
southern Oregon and we grow a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed vegetables on about 40 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 15 acres in production the
last couple years and we've been down here
[SPEAKER_00]: for about 16 years now and we've got two
kids that we're raising as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: two boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really focus a lot on direct sales to
the customers that we have through farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, direct to co-ops and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, I'm the founder of the Living
Soil Symposium that we're in our third
[SPEAKER_00]: year this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, besides a couple other side projects
that I have, kind of take up most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get into farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you moved to Oregon, we talked a
little before the podcast and you had
[SPEAKER_01]: started out in California, you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we started in Santa Cruz in the late
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was right at the very beginning of
when organics really started taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local movement was just starting to
gain its footing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started interning on farms there and
just working in the fields, picking
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries, picking beans, just that
grind, doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we ended up moving to Colorado and
interning there on a couple of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my wife and I ended up managing one
of the farms that she had interned on for
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really gave us our chops as far as
how to be managers, not just farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you moved out to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you bought some land there and
expanded and have gone through some
[SPEAKER_01]: growing pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about your
background with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background with cannabis, it's been a
very loose relationship over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't actively been a grower,
but I've been surrounded by a really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong community here in southern Oregon
of cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been supportive of what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all interacted with each other over
the years and shared tips because it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all wanted to figure out what we can
do to help each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really my relationship has been as
a support to that industry as it's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up something that I know we're
both big proponents of, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and agriculture are should be one
and the same in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can pull a lot of great
information and technology and stuff from
[SPEAKER_01]: the farming community and from agriculture
that already exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to reinvent the wheel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, cannabis is a special plant in a lot
of ways in terms of its medicinal values,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doesn't mean that we can't
cultivate it in a similar fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you mentioned to me off air
that you had your first year growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in a lot of ways similar to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really exciting to take that
project on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it as really a proof of
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: My approach for it was to try to grow the
hemp crop exactly how I would a vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on building my soil
fertility and my soil biology up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last several years working this ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a special spot that I knew I wanted
to put the crop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the area that I've done the most work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, I want to be able to grow
this just like I grow a kale crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see if I can have success from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to grow it without having to
put a lot of hand labor into the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be able to just grow it on
scale just as a way to look at how we
[SPEAKER_00]: might scale up production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did all of the work as far as bed prep
goes with our tractors, the same bedding
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we use in a kale crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the same fertility program that we
use with our kale crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transplanted it mechanically with a
waterwheel transplanter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set it up in a way with a bed system
where we were able to cultivate with our
[SPEAKER_00]: tractors throughout the entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an empty alleyway between the rows
where then we could cultivate on either
[SPEAKER_00]: side once it got taller and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with an overhead irrigation
system and we irrigated overhead all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up until the second week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we transferred to a drip tape after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really interesting to watch
the season progress and see how amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are at growing and how
effective they are at just pulling off
[SPEAKER_00]: this amazing growth in such a short period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the season, the biggest cost
to us was the labor of harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our biggest bottleneck was then
getting the plants down and into our barn
[SPEAKER_00]: to start the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really was the only area that took a
large amount of hand labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else was done in a way that we
would do any other vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really amazing to watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you face any particular challenges
with it and related to like say pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease that you didn't face with your
other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of ways we could
look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very dry fall here in Southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really long summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have strong winds that blow through our
valley every afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as any disease pressures that we
might see in vegetables, we didn't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the plants spaced out enough that
they weren't compacted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were planted on six-foot centers out
in the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only pest pressure we really saw right
after transplant was cucumber beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got cucumber beetles here that are
just rampant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how strong of a population
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we dealt with that was we covered
the plants right after transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With insect netting that we use on like a
lot of our brassica crops to keep flea
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we got the plants up to a healthy
size and then they were just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: crank, they could grow out of any pest
pressure after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We constantly monitored throughout the
season or any kind of mite pressure of any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort or any other disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were constantly checking the fields
just to observe and see what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it was a pretty
straightforward season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't spray anything on the crop
other than it sounds like overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, overhead watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a little bit of supplemental foliar
with fish hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, yeah, it was just a let
it rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you notice anything else in terms of
the crop itself, any changes different
[SPEAKER_01]: than say when you've seen cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was hemp very similar in all respects or
were there anything that you noticed that
[SPEAKER_01]: was particularly different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, everybody that walked through
the field throughout the season didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that it was a hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has such a similar structure to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely couldn't believe that that
was hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you can attribute that to the
fact that the high CBD hemp crops that are
[SPEAKER_00]: specific for that, they've come out of a
breeding regime I'm assuming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different than what I
think of as far as like a fiber hemp would
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, no, it was really
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, I'd say the plants varied
between six and 10 feet tall at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the more compact smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely were more manageable and
the density of the flowers were better on
[SPEAKER_00]: those smaller compact plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What cultivars did you run and did you do
any testing afterwards?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did the plants finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were all cultivars from the
boring hemp company.
[SPEAKER_00]: In boring Oregon, and they were all auto
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the O-T-T-O too crossed with a
variety of other genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did do some independent testing after
the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really have much to compare it
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's going to be going forward
like what I can see as far as improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: from season to season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no expert on the crop itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just growing it out more than
anything just as a starting place to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I could learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your future plans around hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what the marketplace
is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're quickly seeing it move
into being a commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down to a matter of scaling
properly and whether we want to do that or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of other farmers,
vegetable farmers especially, have called
[SPEAKER_00]: me up and say, hey, should I grow a hemp
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer to them always is like,
as long as you have a marketplace for it
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've seen the marketplaces is
definitely challenging and flooded
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm encouraged by the future of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just going to wait and see how
it all develops once the madness of it
[SPEAKER_00]: all, of this first couple of seasons dies
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's going to be more of a
market for these high CBD plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: grown organically as people start using
them more for medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see this side of the industry
growing just from your own experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a matter of the two schools
of thought of whether full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: material as opposed to an isolated
material, which is more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, a lot of times that isolated
material is more easily, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my understanding at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full spectrum material is something
that I think stays more in state right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry is very young right
now and it's going to be interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how it matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope from what I hear from people
that are more knowledgeable in that arena
[SPEAKER_00]: than me, from what I can hear is that
there's a lot more public acceptance each
[SPEAKER_00]: year and people are finding real intrinsic
value in using those high CBD materials to
[SPEAKER_00]: their advantage for their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that as science gets behind it
more and can prove more, so it's just not
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal understanding, that we'll see
wider and wider acceptance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my father is actually dealing with a
rare disease called CIDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's chronic neuropathy and he uses
cannabis that he infuses with coconut oil
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way of topical to help treat a lot of
his pain and it's been life-changing to
[SPEAKER_01]: help him because before that they had him
on super high levels of narcotics that was
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was changing his personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took away all his energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually didn't help deal with the pain
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really helpful in the medicinal side
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to hear that there's farmers like
you out there growing hemp and exploring
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to change topic a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we were talking about the demand,
I know this is a little bit topical right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read more articles about the massive
amount of excess cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're surrounded by these farmers,
what are you hearing regarding this topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people worried about next season?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, where are you at with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Southern Oregon is a hotbed for the
industry, the rec industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's massive concern among a lot
of folks because I think it changed faster
[SPEAKER_00]: and scaled larger and quicker than anybody
could assume that it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no real cap on the number of
licenses as far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been a race to the bottom almost
for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really disconcerting for people
that have put their entire savings into
[SPEAKER_00]: building these brands and now they don't
have anywhere for it to go just because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not the population base here in
Oregon to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects all of us down here,
not just the people directly involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, but all the support
industries and even just the local economy
[SPEAKER_00]: here is there's a lot of people that are
being very cautious with if they expand
[SPEAKER_00]: any of their businesses or how they're
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are being very cautious because I
think we can see the bottom drop out
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, does that mean that it won't recover?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's just part of the growing
pains of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think that people expected to
see it shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think the way that people are
going to survive is by becoming more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient in the way they're growing and
reducing their expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things that we talk about on
this podcast in terms of using
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies and ideas out of the farming
or ag community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see or differentiating your product
by being organic or craft or having
[SPEAKER_01]: something that makes you unique from
someone 's flowers just down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think differentiation is going to
be that's the hot item that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out right now is
differentiating is the thing that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a question of how.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's tough because you have guys
that are farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not marketing companies and they
don't know how to build a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be growing great high quality
cannabis that's organic, but in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that information out to the
consumer, that's a whole different skill
[SPEAKER_01]: set and it's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for a lot of people and so I'm
hopeful that some of this will come out as
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry evolves, but that's that's a
big concern for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I was really
excited to talk about with you when I
[SPEAKER_01]: found out that you were coming on the
podcast was because you've been farming
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables for so long and you have this
this level of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little bit about some of
the mistakes that you've made over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years because I know for me a lot of the
biggest lessons I've learned and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest improvements I've made have been
from screw ups that cost me a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to hear some from your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the mistakes that you've
made that you've that have really improved
[SPEAKER_01]: your farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's been a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's what I always tell
people is that if if you're a farmer just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into farming and you go to an
elder farmer and ask, hey, what what can I
[SPEAKER_00]: do to be successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the farmers that are being the
most honest will not tell you what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's definitely what I
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with younger farmers about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the things that if I could do it
all over again, I think I would have I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have invested in the proper
machinery and tools to scale up more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I would have focused even
more on training my people and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good business culture or like on
farm culture, like focusing even more on
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of my taking care of my crew
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that I never not that I didn't
take care of my crew, but just focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture surrounding the work days and
really looking at at how you can encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, farming is not easy
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get in the middle of a hundred
degree day in August and you see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's productivity really dip down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've learned over the years tips
and tricks that I can pass on to my field
[SPEAKER_00]: managers to to kind of keep the work ethic
and the and the whole vibe of the crew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are the biggest things is
because the people really are the glue
[SPEAKER_00]: that keeps it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that I've learned is
once I was able to afford a full time
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor slash irrigation slash maintenance
guy onto my crew, that was a life changer
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, too, because then I could focus on
being the farmer and he focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts and bolts of keeping it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but some of those things, you know,
that that comes with time as you scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: as you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the biggest things that I've
I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's also micro fails that
I've had as far, you know, just the little
[SPEAKER_00]: things of like getting the proper water on
transplants as soon as you put them out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and not waiting and just having
little failures here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that that kind of just comes with the
territory on a day to day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think going back to what you
mentioned about your staff, I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I learned pretty
quickly is that I can't expect an employee
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to work as hard as I'm willing to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, they may have a passion
for farming, but at the end of day,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you mentioned, you're in 100 degree
weather and it's it's brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's a different mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building that culture and finding ways
to incentivize and support your staff is
[SPEAKER_01]: so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then getting the right staff in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the issues where I've held on to
staff members that maybe necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't the right fit, but kept them on
longer than I should have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we do believe in the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's like family at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and and one of the things that like
a big mental shift for me was several
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, I had an older friend that had
been farming for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said to me, he said, the sooner you
can realize that you work for your
[SPEAKER_00]: employees and not the other way around,
the better your your farm culture is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a while to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started realizing, like,
that's my job is to make sure that my
[SPEAKER_00]: employees have everything they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there is failure on their part,
it's because I haven't trained them well
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once I started approaching it like
that, man, things got so much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: because any time a problem would come up,
I'd be like, OK, what am I not doing here
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively to teach them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't fix the problems of,
you know, somebody that just doesn't care
[SPEAKER_00]: and just doesn't come to work because they
have a horrible work ethic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the day to day, I found that when I
started focusing on what I could do to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a great work environment for them,
things got a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a lot of feedback from your
employees in terms of ways to make
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements around the farm and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I have a very open door policy with
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also understand each other to the
point that if somebody comes and says,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I see it like this and I say,
well, from my experience, that just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they know that I'm not just shooting
them down to shoot them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally will trust me from a point
of of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I try to be open and
communicate that clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always encourage my staff to speak up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also, if they do notice a problem
to try and give me a solution as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they come to me with that problem,
they don't they don't have to if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not able to come up with one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times I find they'll they'll
come to me and say, hey, we're having this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, say, with an animal enclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I think we need to do to
solve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can just turn to them and say,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because they're taking ownership
of the land and of the business and making
[SPEAKER_01]: good decisions that are helping all of us
have a better experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't I can't say enough good things
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of equipment,
I know I've bought equipment that was
[SPEAKER_01]: either underpowered or not suited for the
right job in my on my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you made that mistake in your process
or do you have anything regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing equipment or using equipment
that you'd like to touch on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is I guess it sounds like a
really classic American response or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, which is always by the biggest
machinery that you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean just go overboard with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found over the years that any time
I've bought a I'm like, well, I can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: a six foot disc or if I if it hurts a
little bit, I could buy an eight foot disc
[SPEAKER_00]: and just the efficiencies that come with
the proper sizing of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the long term payout,
if you're spending, you know, 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: more initially, the long term payout is
going to give you a 50 percent return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are the biggest things for
me is just properly sizing the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came from just asking experienced
farmers what they've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't encourage people enough to
reach out to people that have more
[SPEAKER_00]: experience than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think encouraging people to get to
know your neighbors because that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: your pest pressures are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may know the history of your land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can give you experience with what
grows well in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: A ton of benefits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I agree 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other advice to new farmers,
people that want to get into farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the things that I I've been asked
that question a lot over the years and the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I always tell folks are number
one is learn how to be a business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like farming is actually pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's tough, but it's way easier
than running a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can't find that bottom line,
then you're not going to stay in business
[SPEAKER_00]: very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing that that I've learned
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the modern farmer is way more like
an entrepreneur than the classic ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: vision of what a farmer was when our
grandparents were young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing is learn how to run a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing that I always
tell folks is be OK with leasing land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to own the farm,
at least not at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could do it all over again,
I think my wife and I probably would have
[SPEAKER_00]: found a small house somewhere on a small
piece of land and leased a ground to get
[SPEAKER_00]: used to growing in our area, especially
where we moved into this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just not tied to that
piece of land because like our home
[SPEAKER_00]: property that we originally bought,
it's good land, but it's nothing like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground that we have our production acreage
on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that's something that I think
that people get caught up in the idyllic
[SPEAKER_00]: vision of like, oh, I have to own my own
farm to be be able to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just isn't true because the the
amount of land available out there is is
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's growing every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to figure out smart
contractual agreements with the landowners
[SPEAKER_00]: to to make sure you protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can take years to bring back poor
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's you bring up a good point and
something that actually Steve Solomon
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about when he first started
homesteading in Oregon is he wishes that
[SPEAKER_01]: he had bought better land because it took
him forever to bring that land back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just didn't look at it closely enough
when he was first purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once we started growing on our
production piece that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil was at least one hundred times
better than the property at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just saw our yields go through
the roof with not any extra work of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we had been doing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that was just a really eye opener
for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of growing on your lands,
you're obviously planting directly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see a lot of cannabis farmers
planting into containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any thoughts on growing in
containers versus growing directly in
[SPEAKER_01]: ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's like a whole other podcast
on its own, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I think that the jury's still out on if
one is better than the other as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: end result of what what you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it depends on your approach,
your methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like container gardening
allows people more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably mimics mimics the world of
like the classic hydroponic style more
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you get more nutrient flow
through and more water flow through in
[SPEAKER_00]: that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're working in native soils,
you'll see that the frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating is much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there that that comes down to your
your personal ethics and an approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, as well as what kind of resources
as far as irrigation water and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you have available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I prefer like here in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have some amazing class one
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some cannabis farmers pull
off amazing crops just going right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've definitely had to change their
growing approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard when you've been
growing in a in a certain way for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 10, 15 years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you all of a sudden have to get
to where you maybe are only irrigating
[SPEAKER_00]: once or twice or three times a week at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a farmer has to be willing to
make that shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a big proponent of planting
directly in the ground because owning a
[SPEAKER_01]: retail nursery, you can see the difference
when you allow a plant to have as much
[SPEAKER_01]: root space as it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets much larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a great example with our mulberries
where we have some in a container that are
[SPEAKER_01]: about two feet tall now after two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have one in the ground that's
over eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same that was brought in at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you mentioned, the ethics
involved with using less water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to keep the root zone
temperature down, which is probably good
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area because of the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you're not just planting in a native
ground, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably doing some soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really depends on your specific
locale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's a lot of the
ground that people have been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis on for years have been these up
in the hills properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you find heavy, heavy clay content
up there, which could be a real challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in without doing some serious soil
remediation down where I am in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the river valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the cannabis farms that that
surround us down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are class one,
like super loamy, filthy loam soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those there's little that needs to
be done other than say, liming or some pH
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing through that and some
mineralization and then just adding
[SPEAKER_00]: infertility into those into those soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, soil testing is really where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's something that I'm still on a
learning curve with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am no expert with understanding the
intricacies of the full the full world of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I've actively done tests on my
veggie ground over the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: my my understanding of my individual soils
at the farm have grown immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really exciting to watch how
it's changed due to what what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments we put down and and even these
like little nuanced differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: one soil on this side of the property to
another soil type on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: property and how they respond differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a balance to like I I just don't
have the time to spend countless hours
[SPEAKER_00]: like really digging into all of this
because the margins in the vegetable world
[SPEAKER_00]: are so tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the end of the day,
I spend more time just getting product out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of the the cannabis
industry is that it's always seen better
[SPEAKER_00]: margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have been able to focus more on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I've always been a
bit envious of is the ability for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry to really dial in and
look at specifics surrounding soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you bring up a really good point
around soil testing and that it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: simply just another tool like a shovel or
a tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another way of gathering data that
you can use to make more informed
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions about your land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also brought up some other points
that I thought was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are times when it's not
necessarily great to plant in land
[SPEAKER_01]: directly into the ground like when you
have very high clay soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also mention if you had a lot of real
heavy burrowing pests like rats or moles
[SPEAKER_01]: or things like that, then a container
might make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a floodplain where you dig
down and your water line is really high,
[SPEAKER_01]: close to the top surface of your soil,
then you may want to go into a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and if you have really bad heavy
metals or you're on remediated land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, those are just other things I
want to throw out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk a little bit about how you
do fertilize your crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that you have different
programs for different crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you getting your fertility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertility for us comes from a pelleted
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the chicken manure world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pelletized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our pre plant fertilizer is kind of
like our broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what we put out on the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus a lot on cover cropping as far as
fertility goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes nitrogen fixing cover crops,
sometimes organic matter building cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also use a fish hydrolysate
that we put into our irrigation systems
[SPEAKER_00]: either overhead or through drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those are the main fertility
drivers for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also look at mineralization
and our mineral mineralization program has
[SPEAKER_00]: been pretty like we haven't fine tuned it
to each specific crop because of honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just have to keep cruising
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of had this general overview
program, you know, using glacial rock dust
[SPEAKER_00]: and azomite and other trace minerals like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now actually my my education curve on
the whole world of mineralization has
[SPEAKER_00]: really been growing over the last several
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something I'm starting to
dive into a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I I'm no expert on that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can see the the value of that going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything from a biological
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we we've used different
inoculants in our transplants in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've made teas in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I always did with teas in the
past and I've kind of scaled back on on
[SPEAKER_00]: teas because there's kind of like a lot of
a lot going on in that world right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm just kind of the jury's out,
you know, for right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did for a long time,
just for for more than anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: food safety reasons just to keep my
certifiers happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was putting biological teas out on our
cover crops and feeding the feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops instead of the food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just with it, the concept that the
biology would be there and inoculated in
[SPEAKER_00]: those soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we had those soils turned
under, then we could come back and follow
[SPEAKER_00]: with a food crop just because there's a
lot of there's a lot of debate over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of using teas and foodborne
pathogens and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that was our approach in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last several years, I've found a
really good point of I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess I call it like I think of the
biology in our fields is really healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been watching that and we're
having to fertilize less and less each
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just kind of going off of the
bank of fertility and the biology that's
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still seeing great results from
the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'll have to shift that at some
point, but that's kind of been our
[SPEAKER_00]: approach for right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like we have a pretty good
stored bank of fertility and we just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: observing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you say teas, are you talking
about aerated compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I've gone I messed around
with aerated compost teas for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of got into just doing
more of compost extracts, like a real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick extract where I wasn't actively
bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've kind of messed around with with
everything, whether it's been worm based
[SPEAKER_00]: teas or compost based teas or or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly, I never really dove into
it deep just because, again, a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up doing on the vegetable farm,
it comes down to cost and time of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: energy I can put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an interesting kind of like
shoot from the hip kind of project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned you use some cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have some favorites in terms of
actual actual varieties or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I always tell folks what works
here and Southern Oregon may not work
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of have to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, the valley that we're in
here, oats and peas work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can plant oats and peas as late as
December 1st and still get a nice stand
[SPEAKER_00]: before the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on when I'm going to be
harvesting or chopping that that crop down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have more time to let it grow and
say I'm not going to take a field out of
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop until May or June, then I can
get a really nice stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my overwintered go to is oats
and peas like a Caius oat and a Austrian
[SPEAKER_00]: winter pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done rye and vetch in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one of the things I learned the
hard way was an annual rye is the thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: use and not a perennial rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the hard way on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the main growing season,
I've had great success with Sudex like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Sudan cover crop for organic matter
building and weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've used buckwheat a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like buckwheat as a crop because
it's so fast to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like up and down in like six to eight
weeks and a nice little phosphorus boost
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can let it flower out
before it really goes to seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an amazing attractor for beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been the main things I've
worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried some understory planting of
clovers and vetches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really challenging if you don't
have your weed seed bank under control in
[SPEAKER_00]: your fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I would like to
work with more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last three or four years, we've really
focused a lot on making sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: removing our weed seed bank out of the
soils and so making sure that none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds go to flower anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's making a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we get that under control,
I probably will start experimenting with
[SPEAKER_00]: more covers during main season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a manual process where you're
actually going out and physically plucking
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about what we call a bare
fallow, where we'll have a block that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not growing in for a certain cycle
that will go ahead and irrigate that block
[SPEAKER_00]: and then germinate the weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through and do a light
cultivation, nothing deep or aggressive,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a light cultivation on the top to
knock those weeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may do that for, you know,
one to three cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll irrigate, grow them up,
knock them down, grow them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: knock them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll plant a cover crop into
that area and let that grow up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: chop and drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been really good for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, yeah, it's also out in the field
when we have veggies growing, just making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that none of the weeds that do come
up and make it that they ever go to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're actually tilling these cover
crops back into the soil then before you
[SPEAKER_01]: plant your next crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we usually will use a flail mower
just to really pulverize and allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to eat that cover crop up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it depends on what kind of
turnaround you want out of the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the smaller that we can make the
residue, the faster the soil can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like eat it up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's kind of been our our
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're increasing the surface area for the
microbes to be able to consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about some of
the advocacy work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this upcoming Living Soil
Symposium that I'm really disappointed I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be out of town for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my buddy Jaya Palmer has been a
speaker in previous years and he raved
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of friends that have
attended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the goals around that and what what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I founded the Living Soil Symposium
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really came out of the I just saw the
greater agricultural community on online
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a lot of these techniques to
take our farms beyond organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what these next steps would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also saw a lack of depth to
community as far as the communication goes
[SPEAKER_00]: online, because there's only so much you
can do with thumb typing your response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just don't get as deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, man, we just really need to
create a venue for a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are similar minded to get together and
really go deep on some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the real premise for why I
created the event originally was just to
[SPEAKER_00]: get people together and have these
interactive conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always encouraged it to be a two
way street as far as the audience
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with the presenters and vice
versa, instead of just being talked to by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in a PowerPoint presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means do I have the structure of the
symposium completely figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year is a is another permutation of
what the previous year was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we listen and observe what the
community at large is saying and are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to bring in a diverse set of
presenters each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like this year, we've really
expanded out into a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: traditions of farming, whether it's
whether it's permaculture or grazing or
[SPEAKER_00]: orchards or vineyards and hemp and
cannabis and even vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just really trying to widen our
reach and let the community realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: there there's a lot of people out there
talking the same message, even though we
[SPEAKER_00]: might have a different crop that is our,
you know, that's our income crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that there can be this cross
pollination between these different
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies of farming that we can find
the commonality and then come out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: being better, better growers altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main idea of what what I was
trying to do with creating the symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the symposium this year is being held
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts on March 23rd through the 25th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a cannabis symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do have some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cannabis related speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I see a good friend of mine here.
[SPEAKER_01]: David Bernard Perrone is going to be one
of your one of your speakers for the
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you want to
highlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any any talks that you're really looking
forward to this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: People you haven't heard before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's several folks that I
brought on because I wanted to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they would bring into the fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Zach Lokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a book called The Permaculture
Market Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really intrigued by what he's doing,
where he's doing like a market scale
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable operation, but with permaculture
design in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Portland local, Peter McCoy,
he has radical mycology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're going to see what an
important place fungi play in agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to bring his voice in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the overall thing that I
really want people to understand is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to look at the symposium as a
curriculum, a weekend curriculum as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping that there's some there's
some synergy between one presenter and
[SPEAKER_00]: another presenter, that one presenter can
fill in a piece of the puzzle and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: presenter can fill in another piece of the
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like our friend Sam from soil
symbiotics, he talks a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have this fella, Dan
Kitteridge, who's part of the bio nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: association, and he focuses on nutrient
density and crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that there can be a
continuation of education between those
[SPEAKER_00]: two guys presentations that that Sam can
talk about the science and the specifics
[SPEAKER_00]: behind mineralization and the importance
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dan can connect the dots to how
that translates to the food that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually eating or the cannabis we're
actually consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm I'm working hard on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that I know is kind of
the most out there idea that we're hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on this year is I have a group of folks
that are we're going to be actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the social like we're the
social permaculture of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I have folks that are going
to look at the design of the event and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be observing the event as
if they were visiting a farm to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: a permaculture design onto that farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like what what is the cultural
structure of our event and what can we do
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has the proper way, the proper flow
with systems management, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's it's kind of this esoteric and
out there idea that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really worth it to look
at the culture that's driving the event is
[SPEAKER_00]: just as important as the information that
we're getting out of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I'm really
excited about as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the great things about
permaculture is since it is a design
[SPEAKER_01]: system, you can really apply it to
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are applying it to the
technology industry to just about just
[SPEAKER_01]: about anything you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's wonderful that you're
looking at the social aspect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm really excited that you're
putting on this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it fills something in the
industry that's been needed, needing to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely gaining traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope people will definitely go and
check it out if they haven't heard of it
[SPEAKER_01]: or if they haven't gotten their tickets
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there still room available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, their tickets are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're they're going to be
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tickets close March 17th because we do
serve lunch both days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of need to know our numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sooner that people get their
tickets, the better for us, just so we
[SPEAKER_00]: know how many people to expect and we can
prepare accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the tickets are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get tickets for there's a Friday
farm visit to a farm right outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of a hands on practical
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tickets are limited to just 100
tickets available for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Saturday and Sunday sessions,
you can get a ticket to one or both
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just really whatever people can
fit into their schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly encourage people to come and be
part of the community discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've been focusing a lot
on is making sure that the audience is
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked just as strong as our list of
presenters, because that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me because it is a it is a
dialogue between the entire community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the stronger that we can make the
entire the entire group of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jaya came back super energized from
from the last one that he attended talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how it's just a wonderful group of
people and especially the audience itself
[SPEAKER_01]: having like minded people in the same room
that are able to share all their ideas,
[SPEAKER_01]: because everyone has a story and everyone
has experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, was there anything else you wanted
you wanted to cover before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want to talk any more related to
farming or the symposium or anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just I just want your listeners to
know how glad I am that you're doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the more people that can do
podcasts like this to really get the
[SPEAKER_00]: message out about about what we can what's
really possible for us going forward in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just applaud you for the work that
you're doing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's follow up again maybe after
the symposium and see if you can share
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things that you learned at the
symposium and some of the exciting new new
[SPEAKER_01]: things going on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this podcast has been great for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open doors in terms of meeting new
people like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get this podcast up right away for
listeners so that they can sign up for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Living Soil Symposium this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to talking soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Chris, I'm having you back on the show
today to talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Living Soil Symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we first recorded the show,
we were talking up the symposium and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: so excited for what you guys were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some things happened and the show
was canceled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to use this as a platform to
talk a little bit about that process and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of what happened and let listeners
kind of into your brain and what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back on, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important for me to,
you know, relay the message and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I've learned after the fact
now that we've had to cancel the
[SPEAKER_00]: symposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it came down to ticket sales for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had we knew that the ticket sales had
been low, but the previous two years
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd been low until the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had previous two years we had sold a
large majority of our tickets in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, once I checked in with my
team, I saw that they were just not there
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were watching how fast or slow they
had been going and started kind of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the math and said, man, there is no way
that we're going to be able to reach our
[SPEAKER_00]: breakeven point in the next three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, we had like three weeks
of ticket sales left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was because we had a cutoff
date seven to ten days before the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: event so we could get plate counts for the
meals for both days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said there's no way that we're going
to reach that that number in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it just won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really came down to a business decision
of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was I could cancel the event now,
which has been about a week ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you and I are talking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can lose the money on all of my
deposits on all the event space and and
[SPEAKER_00]: the extra costs that that I had already
invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I could try to see if we could weather
the storm and really make a move to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, if I didn't find that
breakeven point, then I was going to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: about another twenty thousand dollars on
top of what I was already losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I had to make that decision
and say, I just have to call this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just not this is just not going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really comes down to it was my
own personal financial responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to make that decision from my
standpoint, because I didn't have a backer
[SPEAKER_00]: on any of this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been, you know, my own my own
money to bootstrap this whole thing from
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was your your vision, this
symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was something that you put together
out of your passion for this style of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you say your ticket sales were
low, I know you and I talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking, you know, 10 or 20
tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking hundreds of tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a yeah, it was really a
financial decision on your part to cancel
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it wasn't an easy decision for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure it's been you've gotten some
feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some both positive and negative
feedback on your Instagram page since
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk a little about sort of
the emotional process you went through
[SPEAKER_01]: with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have any comments to the people
who left both positive and negative
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, I would say I listened
to all the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that I don't think any
of the feedback was out of line at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I'm really good at critiquing
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being a farmer, you kind of have
to be good at critiquing yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of things that I I took
chances on that I shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that there was a greater a
greater capacity for the event this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found a bigger space that could
facilitate a lot a larger a larger group
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that meant that we had to move up to
Portland because I didn't find a space
[SPEAKER_00]: down here in southern Oregon where I'd had
it the previous two years that could hold
[SPEAKER_00]: that number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a mistake on my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand that the added cost
of of having a bigger space meant that my
[SPEAKER_00]: upfront costs were more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was more on the line for for making
sure that I I sold X a number of tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely realize in the world of
running an event like this, once you start
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling up, it becomes more challenging to
do it with a minimal number of sponsors
[SPEAKER_00]: and not having a trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that and that was something that I
was trying to avoid was having a trade
[SPEAKER_00]: show that brings in money and having a lot
of sponsorships that brings in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really trying to keep it into a
symposium atmosphere of of really critical
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without being clouded by sales of products
or trying to pitch products or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a big lesson for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that in the future,
if I was going to do something more,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would I would definitely have a
trade show and have a ton of sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that I would look at a
different a different format, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I saw as far as
comments were that it was too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that that cost that I was charging
for the event for the two days was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a break even cost for us because
I didn't have a ton of sponsorships and
[SPEAKER_00]: because I didn't have a trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we were working really
hard to pay all of the presenters properly
[SPEAKER_00]: this year and in years past, people had
done it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though a lot of people still
wanted to do that, we were trying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to pay everybody fairly to
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't a lot, but it was like,
but once you have the amount of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had presenting this year,
once you multiply it by that many people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it adds up to a chunk of a chunk of cash
to get people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really the reason for the
increase in the ticket price this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the state of agriculture
right now, especially the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, I had a lot of people reach out
to me and say, hey, man, we came last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, but we just can't afford to come
this year because the financial state of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, especially here in
Oregon right now, is really on rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a big part of my demographic
is the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were the people outside of
cannabis that were just in agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: together that just said, you know,
we're kind of burned out on conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them, it just seemed like another
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably my self and my
team's fault for not putting the message
[SPEAKER_00]: out there stronger as to how we were going
to differentiate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that I'm learning
from as well, that just allowing a
[SPEAKER_00]: conference or symposium like this to grow
organically, it worked really well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two years, just word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we were kind of growing up,
I think that we probably should have
[SPEAKER_00]: earmarked a much bigger chunk of our
budget towards pushing posts to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: paid advertising, paid marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out to all the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I am looking
into for the future, how I would approach
[SPEAKER_00]: things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, in the last year,
a lot of the algorithms in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and Facebook have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we were as aware of
that as we are now, just that the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: reach is just not the same it was a year
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those things together,
I think, were major contributors and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were, you know, smaller other factors,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like that's it's like there's
like the overall takeaway is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket sales were just low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the idea that being in
Portland, since I'm up in the Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: area, being able to bring people down from
Washington out of the 502 market to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to attend as well, I think is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on a lot of things there that
I think are all really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I know I had talked with some
with some good friends in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing something similar to what you
were doing, like a symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are all these challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with this podcast, I've avoided
having advertising on here or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many issues around that
in terms of what products that you
[SPEAKER_01]: personally support or feel are created
ethically and that you would even want at
[SPEAKER_01]: a trade show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you go that route, it's really
it's a slippery slope when when money
[SPEAKER_01]: starts coming in and saying no to some
people and yes to others, I think is a
[SPEAKER_01]: real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I commend you in that and staying with
that symposium forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really hopeful that next year we
can generate enough interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to come on board and help out
as much as I can from the outside in
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting what you're doing, because I
think it's so important that we get this
[SPEAKER_01]: information out to the wider the wider
audience, both in cannabis and in farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's I think that that's
something that I'm taking away from this
[SPEAKER_00]: is that when you are trying to trying to
put a message that's this big and this
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse out there, which really,
I mean, honestly, the living soils moniker
[SPEAKER_00]: was really just saying nature,
you know, like we're just all trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find our own pattern recognition of
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you're trying to take
something on that big, like it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's something that I'm
realizing is that this is this is a long
[SPEAKER_00]: path that I'm taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like I I don't think that I
took that as seriously as I should have as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like how much work it takes to
affect culture in a healthy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that I'm I'm
taking note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we need to keep pushing forward
with this this educational message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I really view this as a
hiccup in the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than the fact that it kind of
sucks for me financially, in the short
[SPEAKER_00]: term, in the long term, I know that the
that the end result is is and can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to be patient with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad to hear that you're still
moving forward with everything and not too
[SPEAKER_01]: discouraged by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that listeners and people that
were attend, you know, attendees were open
[SPEAKER_01]: minded to the greater situation,
the perspective here in terms of what you
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going through and the energy you're
putting into this and what it's costing
[SPEAKER_01]: you financially for you and your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you touched on with this
symposium that I think is is really the
[SPEAKER_01]: coolest thing about it is that you're when
you say that living soils is just is just
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have and this is something we talked
about off air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these different ways of
cultivation and farming, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our community in terms of, you know,
Korean natural farming, permaculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotic farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have all these bio dynamics,
all these different styles or
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies that are all slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all organic and all looking to looking
to promote ethical and sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I love about your symposium is
it's getting all these people together to
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you're an open minded human
being, an individual, there's something to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from every group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, each one is going to be slightly
different, but each one has a really
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful message that we can share and all
learn from each other so that maybe we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to have all these separate
groups that are divided tribes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but rather just united under this idea of
trying to save the environment and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I you know, the analogy that I've been
using in all of this is like I've I just
[SPEAKER_00]: view it as speaking different languages
and then you have to get everybody in one
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like when you see the United
Nations kind of get together and meet and
[SPEAKER_00]: you see all these people with different
headsets on that have their the
[SPEAKER_00]: translation is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's really what I view the
symposium to be was a place where people
[SPEAKER_00]: are speaking different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, we're all
basically speaking the same language.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how we're going about presenting
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that's that's something
that I keep in mind in all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, was there anything else you wanted
to cover in terms of the symposium itself
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything else you want to say to
listeners regarding what was going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, nothing other than some folks
have already reached out to me with
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorming ideas of how they would like
to see things go forward or what their
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas are to to make things continue,
this educational path continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I so I just encourage people to keep
reaching out to us with their ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also encourage people to take it
into their own hands if they see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can create a group of like minded folks or
open minded folks in their own communities
[SPEAKER_00]: that you should start creating events,
small micro events yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's one idea that I've
really, really resonated with over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last week as several people have said,
well, I'm just going to start my own event
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then maybe we can meet up at the
symposium each year to kind of share our
[SPEAKER_00]: regional ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like so if if nothing else,
maybe this is a this kind of like bump in
[SPEAKER_00]: the road is a catalyst for other folks to
realize that they can take, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: take that power in their own hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of like a Ted Talks thing with Ted
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, you know, doing their own
their own because that's the thing is like
[SPEAKER_00]: what we realize is that all of our farms
are different, you know, and so and that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a regional difference,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there's folks in Colorado that
said we're going to start a small a small
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering out here of folks and talk about
the same topics that you'd be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the symposium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of them would love to come to
get together in a yearly celebration of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're learning and share it with
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's all about
brainstorming together as a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to I'd love to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Further about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we can I mean, you're down in
Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to have something up
here to, you know, smaller events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add this on to the podcast so
people can get a little more perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: on what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you get back to the farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you got a lot of work to do out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Chris Jagger, owner of Blue Fox
Farm.
