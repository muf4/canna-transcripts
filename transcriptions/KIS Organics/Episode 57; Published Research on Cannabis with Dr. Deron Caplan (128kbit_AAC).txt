[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you probably already know, very little
research exists on cannabis and much of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is not shared openly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited to see these papers and
doctoral thesis from my next guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may wish to check out the publications

[SPEAKER_00]: to stay up to date on the latest research
we are doing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Darren Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darren is a horticultural scientist and
the director of plant science at Flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelowna, BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's spelled F-L-O-W-R.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first person in North America
to earn a PhD with research focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Kaplan has written and published
several peer-reviewed articles on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production, focusing on irrigation,
growing media, fertilization, and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has testified on cannabis production
before the Canadian Senate Standing
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and
has provided expert commentary on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for a variety of media outlets,
including CBC, Nature, and Rolling Stone
[SPEAKER_00]: Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start off giving listeners a
little bit of your background and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: got into, well, essentially cannabis
research and your PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've kind of always been interested in
plant science and horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I studied environmental science in
undergrad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was looking for graduate
research, it was about the time when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about legalizing cannabis for
recreational purposes in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking to some prospective
advisors and one of them was considering
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some research in cannabis,
who became my advisor, Dr. Yubin Zhang at
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was so exciting to me about
cannabis, not that I was so involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis specifically, but there's no
research on the horticultural,
[SPEAKER_01]: any horticultural production aspects of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a new scientist starting in an
industry where you could kind of learn so
[SPEAKER_01]: much so quickly and kind of decide what
you want to learn was incredibly exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of an obvious choice and
kind of the rest was history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got deep into cannabis and I've been in
the industry for about five years doing
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of nothing but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing I love about it too,
is there's so much to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so few horticultural plants and
crops that are even out there anymore that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have quite a body of research around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I too am really passionate about the
fact that you can do a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting work and really discover stuff
pretty quickly with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just dive right in with some
of these papers?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first ones here is entitled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I have the right one in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, optimal rate of organic fertilizer
during the vegetative stage for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in two core-based substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that study and kind of give listeners a
[SPEAKER_00]: little background?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be clear, I will put links to
all of these studies if people really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to dive into the details of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be available on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first study that I did in my
graduate research was on growing
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates and on organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because there was so little
research, there was almost nothing on
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer or on growing media for that
was cannabis specifically kind of started
[SPEAKER_01]: from ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at determining optimal
fertilizer or fertilization rates for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis during both the vegetative stage
and the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also custom formulated growing
substrates for both of those stages to
[SPEAKER_01]: coincide with those fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were working with a licensed
cannabis producer in Ontario called Vivo
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were supporting all of this
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of wanted to improve their
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we tailored our research somewhat
to try and help them, but also just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase the body of knowledge on these
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit about sort of how
you established the methodology here and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you were exactly testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you were using cocoa core
based media for your substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you fed different levels of
organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what that organic
fertilizer was, how you fed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit about maybe the growth
chamber?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these trials were in controlled
environment growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are just very large kind of walk
in growth chambers that you can really
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly control the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very important for making these
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable to other growing environments,
because if you have a lot of variability
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere, it's hard to kind of tease out
the effects of the fertilizer or the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing medium, which, for example,
if the lighting is not uniform,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lighting will probably have a much
stronger effect than the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we custom developed these two growing
media with different container capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them was with a higher container
capacity, meaning that it holds more water
[SPEAKER_01]: after it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one with a lower container
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are often considered a high
porosity or, you know, this pro mix HP,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a high porosity growing medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an example of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we formulated these two based on their
container capacities to see if cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prefers a drier growing medium or a wetter
growing medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that in both vegetative and
flowering stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as in a full factorial
experiment, we applied five different
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer rates to each of these growing
mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that during we did a whole
experiment during the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in another publication, we did it in
the flowering stage with two other growing
[SPEAKER_01]: mediums that we also developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, we teased out what the
optimal rate of complete fertilizer is for
[SPEAKER_01]: both of these stages in these growing
mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and one thing I want to highlight
from your paper, this is a direct quote
[SPEAKER_00]: actually from that you pulled out relating
to the work of Dr. Zhang, your advisor,
[SPEAKER_00]: he you mentioned different substrate
straits have different physical and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it is essential to further gate
plants accordingly, to ensure an adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big takeaway, I think, is that we
need to realize that this study is very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to cocoa core in the environment
that you had created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't necessarily extrapolate this
data across peat moss and rock wool and
[SPEAKER_00]: ebb and flow systems and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that you were able to get a good
foundation for some possibilities for NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for cannabis and during the
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about these publications or any
horticultural research for that matter is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're designed in that they should
be widely applicable, but obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: there's limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on your growing system,
if you're using like you say, a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: growing system with rock wool compared to
something like what we use with organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and cocoa coir, you're going to
have a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the general trend is probably
applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found is that there is a
maximum yield at a certain nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of this organic nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to find decreasing yields
after a certain rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use the salt content in the
substrate maybe as an indicator of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we found that if you fertilize
too much, then you're actually getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution effect on some of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably applicable kind of
across the board because it's likely a
[SPEAKER_01]: response to high salinity in the growing
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say based on your,
you know, the environment that you created
[SPEAKER_00]: here with nutrients, what did you find to
be the optimal sort of NPK level for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis based on this test result in
cocoa coir with your study?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't actually look at different
NPK levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was one complete fertilizer for the
vegetative stage and a different complete
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer for the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we looked at was the rate of that
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we're determining if cannabis
was a heavy feeder, a light feeder in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, this one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, and we weren't actually
looking at all about the NPK ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you had a specific NPK fertilizer
and you were looking at just the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that you fed that fertilizer
what was optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not necessarily looking at how
to adjust, you know, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, potassium, and the variety of
other anions and cations that a plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, but rather just whatever
concentration was best in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that, I want to, something you
mentioned there, I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you think salinity has
an effect, but that you actually saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in certain cannabinoids and THC
when you hit a certain level of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just talk a little bit more about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found that up to a certain point,
the increasing fertilizer would increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the yield, would increase cannabinoid
content, and that was positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a point, after a certain point,
there was decreasing returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, at a fairly high rate,
we'd actually found a dilution of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we found THC, THCA, and CBGA in this
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all decreased when you- That's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: hit a certain concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just to kind of expand out
on that, I'm curious why you chose organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer because it's so much more
common in, you know, in academic research
[SPEAKER_00]: to use mineral salts or chemical
fertilizers for the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to really control uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a fairly difficult choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part of that was that the producer
that we were working with was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to match what they were doing
to help, you know, they were funding the
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to help them as much as we
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also had a, you know, environmental
aspect to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using coco coir because a lot of
growers are moving towards coco coir as an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally sustainable alternative to
peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into that argument,
but it's some consider it more
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to have that angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it would have been more widely
applicable if we did salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For your information, we're actually doing
that now in the same lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to focus on, you know,
this being completely organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the coco coir versus peat argument
could go for an entire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have my opinion and I'm sure you
have one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't get into that too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess my question related to that
too is how do you feel nutrient uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to the ability to do this research
with an organic nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of what the growers that I
work with are doing, and I know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: good friends with David Bernard Perrone,
who's a friend of mine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of putting in a lot of these dry
amendments in meal forms directly into a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and not really having as much
control over uptake, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have that nutrient cycling
process that's being really driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: plant exudates and microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that factor in when you're trying
to do research or how that might impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, the results of a study like this
using organic fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Studying organic fertilizer is incredibly
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know, because from listening
to your podcast, I know you're very
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million factors and it's very
hard to control for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, at this point,
it's impossible to control for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of just finding a
solution that works and understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to understand why it works
at this point in time and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving that for a little bit later when
we have some more time to tease apart,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the microbial interactions,
how nitrogen breaks down and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of nitrogen and other macro
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly complex, but growers still
need to have answers to these questions
[SPEAKER_01]: now because they are growing organically
and they still need these, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: practical, practical research to support
their activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're doing is
looking for trends, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be sort of possibly extrapolated
or used across other forms of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know with the work I'm doing with Ben
Higgins and Nate over at Goldleaf Gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we try and do is say, okay,
living soil, this microbial diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just one variable and we can't
control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't fully understand it, but we can
control for it and say that all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all of our replications are
going to be in a similar soil mix with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, similar microbial levels and
biomass and then we can make one change in
[SPEAKER_00]: say lighting or a cultivar or our nutrient
levels in that system and then try and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out sort of a trend based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not, like you said, we're not
going to fully understand exactly how the
[SPEAKER_00]: process is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the challenges I find
with any organic research is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers don't want to do that work
because they can't control every aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of, some of it is up to sort of
that microbial response and interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes much more of kind of applied
science than, than pure science and that
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of researchers, that's fairly
difficult because again, we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: much about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, why not start from the
beginning?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also, you know, all of North
America jumped into this industry and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
growers who are already, who already need
[SPEAKER_01]: this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So giving them something that's useful for
me at this point is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: important than really understanding every
single aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be your, you know,
I know we've talked about a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what, let's just say, what were your
big takeaways from this paper and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll, you know, also the flowering paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially a very similar trial,
but looking at organic fertilizer rates
[SPEAKER_00]: during the flowering stage, what would be
your big sort of like highlight points for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers looking at the research that you
did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the vegetative stage, we found that
cannabis can tolerate a range of growing
[SPEAKER_01]: media parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the wetter substrate and the
drier substrate performed well in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a relatively high rate of organic
fertilizer to be optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at milligrams of
nitrogen per liter, you know, equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: of a complete fertilizer, it's on the high
end compared to most other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at, if you know your
nitrogen rates for tomatoes, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: in organic fertilizer, you can probably
fit it in with that, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, as a general rule, that's,
I think that's fairly applicable kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the flowering stage,
we had some more complex results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we had increasing, increasing
yield with increasing fertilizer rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was for both growing substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found that the drier growing
substrate, the higher porosity one,
[SPEAKER_01]: produced 11% higher yields and also larger
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's likely that cannabis in the
flowering stage prefers a drier substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to put that in context, because it's a
drier substrate, it needed to be irrigated
[SPEAKER_01]: more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to tease apart whether it was
increased irrigation frequency that it
[SPEAKER_01]: likes, or whether it likes a drier
substrate, but either way, you'll have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same effect by using a drier substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anecdotally, we've been doing a lot
more with blue mats, which is an osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: based system that regulates moisture
temperature or moisture level in soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps it even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a sort of a drip, drip irrigation
system that is based off of the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're maintaining it within a very
small range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just some really
preliminary work with gold leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we found actually substantially
increased yields by that more frequent
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis is that we're getting
better nutrient cycling because the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are being held in a range of
moisture content that is optimal for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to cycle these nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is all really preliminary
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense, to be honest,
in kind of looking into the literature on
[SPEAKER_01]: this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did quite a bit of research on
irrigation for cannabis as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But increased frequency has a lot of
benefits, not just on the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, but also just in making
nutrients more available, because most
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are actually transported through
mass transport with the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's more water, then it's more
likely that the plant can uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things, though, about this
two studies that I noticed that you
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighted was that the yield increased
with the increasing fertilizer rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one of them, what you call U2HP,
your yield reached a maximum, and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: U2 yield increased linearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just touch on that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of your yields, and I know you
mentioned that your yields were a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit lower than what you've seen as an
industry standard or what you were using
[SPEAKER_00]: for an industry standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of that kind of plateau that
we saw in the dryer substrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the U2HP, in general,
the yield was higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we believe that it was able to reach a
plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can kind of see more of a
maximum at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't think that the wetter
substrate actually reached that plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of how we explain that
difference in the trend with increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer rate on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and you touch on pH too a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what you
noticed in terms of pH range and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have affected yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the top of my head, I can't recall the
ranges that we found were optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we generally found that during both
growth stages that cannabis had a fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: wide range of pH tolerances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't do nutrient tissue,
tissue nutrient analysis to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just being horticultural scientists,
we have a fairly general idea of when our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're showing signs of high or low
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I generally believe that you want to
keep cannabis at a pretty tight range of
[SPEAKER_01]: pH, especially with hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found that there was almost no
difference with a higher or lower pH
[SPEAKER_01]: range, quite a bit outside of the normal
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anecdotally, I found the same thing
with a lot of different soil tests that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some soil tests where the pH is
quite high, very alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, visually and with growers,
their yields are still quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to tolerate, like you mentioned,
quite a wide range of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your paper here, you say, within the
measured range of substrate pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a means of 5.1 to 7.4 in the
flowering stage, there were no visual
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of pH-induced disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This observation overlaps the acceptable
range cited in Kaplan et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 of 6.7 to 7.2 for the flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm glad you have that in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could get quite high in pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there was no visible symptoms
of nutrient disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, there's a lot more in these
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're not going to cover
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to talk
about those two before we move on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other two, which I think are even more
interesting in terms of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, in the flowering stage,
I just want to talk about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: increased increasing fertilizer rate
influenced some of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I briefly touched on this in the
beginning, but it wasn't all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that had a dilution effect
with increasing fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a dilution in terms of
absolute concentration in the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a dilution in terms of the grams
of THC or THCA or CBG per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a function of yield and of
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And effectively, if you're trying to,
you know, if your target is to produce as
[SPEAKER_01]: much THC as possible, you have decreasing
returns if you are increasing your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer rate past the optimum that we
figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have to figure out your own
optimum in your production environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no benefit in terms,
even if you're seeing a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, increasing yields, it's not
always better to keep increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer rate because you're not
increasing your THC or your THCA or your
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fertilizer that you used,
I don't have that part in front of me
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I it's somewhere in all these stack of
papers, but I think it was around like a
[SPEAKER_00]: four one two four one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the vegetative stage, it was a four
one point three one point seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the flowering stage,
it was a two point eight and sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: two zero point eight three point two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting because I
saw another gentleman with a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: company at a soil scientist convention or
society meeting, and he was saying four
[SPEAKER_00]: one one was the levels that he targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I found, which seems
similar to the fertilizer you're using is
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium seems to be more of a
controlling variable for overall plant
[SPEAKER_00]: yield than phosphorus, because I know the
in this industry, everyone thinks we need
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more phosphorus for flowering,
but it seems to be massively over applied
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the research I've I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch a little bit about I know we
we need to talk about nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but let's talk about phosphorus and
potassium and sort of what your findings
[SPEAKER_00]: are with with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm not I'm not incredibly
familiar with this, but in my kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: general impression is that phosphorus is
often over applied now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In agriculture, and that's because it
doesn't do all that much damage if you
[SPEAKER_01]: over apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a certain, you know,
there's a certain low range that you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have equal equal results with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But say if you were to double or triple
it, you might have the same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, for a grower doesn't make
much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the environment, for example,
phosphorus is one of the most damaging
[SPEAKER_01]: components of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really does have some
implications if we're over utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a I'm glad you mentioned the
environmental impacts, because to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the that's the biggest reason for
us to limit phosphorus, because we are the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry is a big culprit of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I asked you a question off air
about how when you read these papers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all correlated around nitrogen or N
per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of explain that to me a
little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of reiterate that for
listeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in both of these publications,
we express nitrogen in in milligrams or we
[SPEAKER_01]: express fertilizer rate in milligrams of
nitrogen per liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a common terminology in these
types of papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically just if you have to
look back at the analysis of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer and it's a relative amount of
that fertilizer, it doesn't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not you're not actively changing the
amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ratio, it's just how much of that
how much total of that fertilizer are you
[SPEAKER_01]: applying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these papers are not about rates of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about rates of organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not about identifying the type
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not distinguishing between nitrates
or ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at strictly total nitrogen,
you said?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ratios are available in the
publication of of ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing I noticed when
looking at that fertilizer mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was quite low in trace trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The copper manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that could have had some sort
of effect on the on the trial itself or
[SPEAKER_00]: overall plant growth or yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: To my recollection, we actually had a
micronutrient additive in both of these in
[SPEAKER_01]: in all the fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for sure you had one in the
flowering one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have in the vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just totally missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's probably the likely culprit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it was if there wasn't one in
the flowering stage, it was only a period
[SPEAKER_01]: of maybe 20 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very unlikely to see micronutrient
issues in such a short period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the flowering stage, definitely it
was necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we didn't try without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just based on experience, it's likely
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could do further.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of further research.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do in general, but but around like
optimal MPK levels, optimal fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations across various substrates
and optimal trace mineral levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for four cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's there's honestly so much to
be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested in looking at the
different MPK ratios and looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, actually teasing out ideal pH
ranges and substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solidity levels is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, irrigation, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and keeping it's really important,
again, to reiterate, it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep in mind that it's kind of a whole
systems approach where you have to if you
[SPEAKER_01]: change your fertilizer, you also have to
adjust to your irrigation and your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: medium and your your lighting and the
vapor pressure deficits in the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and the CO2 and everything has to kind of
be understood as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do portray the research in a
way where you're expressing all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, it's easier to take that
information and apply it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little bit of a sidebar,
but I just want to remind listeners that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there are people out there that
claim they know, you know, the optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of manganese a cannabis plant needs
or the optimal amount of zinc or all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different all these different
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the research just hasn't been
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they're that confident,
I would be a little bit concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they're actually saying or
sharing, because I know you did quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of research trying to find research
and they're just it just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just caution listeners around
in that regard when people make conclusive
[SPEAKER_00]: comments regarding this crop or this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the number one issue I run into
working with growers like I do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for context, these two
publications were put out a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first publications on
fertilizer rate and indoor cannabis pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really nothing out there
that's, you know, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: of any validity other than these and
whatever comes next for for fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to be based on their claims off
of unless they're doing really rigorous R
[SPEAKER_01]: &D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people doing research and a
lot of it they'll just claim as
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary and not share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most likely, at least what I've seen
in the fertilizer bottle nutrient industry
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis is a lot of it is just
speculation and claims and snake oil
[SPEAKER_00]: versus actual science to support what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to talk to you about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the fact, because in my current
position, I'm working with Hawthorne
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening Company, which now, which has
acquired General Hydroponics and Botanic
[SPEAKER_01]: Air, all sorts of other companies that
service the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my role is going to be to do exactly
what we're talking about and try and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what makes these products work,
how can we make them better?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we develop new products that
are based off of good science rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: just claims?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why don't we just touch on that now
and then come back to these last two
[SPEAKER_00]: papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Hawthorne, you know,
they are they I believe they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidiary of Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, of Scots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Scots.
[SPEAKER_01]: No association with Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're you're 100 percent correct on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they do sell they do sell Monsanto
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a partnership there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have a license for Roundup,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For for the glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad we rated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking about these
companies that are coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry like like Scots and
funding around research in terms of who
[SPEAKER_00]: can afford funding, how do you see you
know, one of the questions I had for you
[SPEAKER_00]: that I mentioned off air was what do you
see is the future of academic research
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is funding going to be an issue and who's
going to drive really that funding once
[SPEAKER_00]: you have legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both here on the federal level,
both here in the United States and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's a very exciting time
for research in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my personal opinion, I've never found
there to be limitations on funding in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, specifically on academic research
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of thought working with the
University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had lots of growers approach us and
also vendors of specific products that
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to prove their claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming to university, it's a really
great way of doing that and supporting a
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate student or supporting some
independent research to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make the claims on your bottle or
on your container, make them mean
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of potential for
both both companies and for academic
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers to to bring some validity to
some of these products and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of work to be done,
and it seems to be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that Scott's in acquiring all
these companies, they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a company that that backs all of
their claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's a very established
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're going to say something on
their bottle, they have to they have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to substantiate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're doing that work for all
of these these products that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: marketed to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to have that kind of
level of rigor in in the products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold by Hawthorne.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and just to be totally transparent
here, as someone who's not a huge fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these larger companies,
you know, like Scott's and Hawthorne in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their role in the industry,
which is separate from the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: their products or the research they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make that very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge fan of glyphosate,
for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about if we're
talking about university research around
[SPEAKER_00]: products and let's just take, you know,
a general hydro grow formula, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome that research is
being done to improve the quality of that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do other companies compete and not be
run out of the industry, assuming that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't afford, you know, the hundreds
of thousands of dollars that may go into
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a university trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's various ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you if you hire a scientist
on your team who's, you know, a
[SPEAKER_01]: well-respected horticultural scientist to
do trials on your product and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce white papers or even publications
yourself and prove that they're valid,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's just as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely an edge in having,
you know, we have a 40,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose built research facility with
dozens of grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all these resources,
which, you know, in our purposes and for
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawthorne and for Flower, which is the
company that I actually work for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's obviously an edge and
we're going to be able to answer these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that it's impossible
for some of the smaller players to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the same work to the same rigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's nothing to stop other
people from doing, you know, research
[SPEAKER_00]: collection or data collection,
their own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're doing our own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down at Goldleaf through through that
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're totally right about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just I think it's great that there
is more research and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where that money is coming from can be a
little bit challenging for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like as long as
that research is published, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: useful information that everyone can kind
of draw from draw from and improve our
[SPEAKER_00]: overall body of knowledge around this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see all the research, though,
being published on the sorts of work that
[SPEAKER_00]: at least what you're doing there in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's definitely going to be some
some of it will be released.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it will be kind of for the
technical service reps to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: inform the people that we're selling to
the Hawthorne is selling to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using and how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's you know, we haven't
we haven't done any of this work yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's definitely plans to be to put
some of this out and to do some peer
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewed peer reviewed publications and
really to increase the body of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, in my opinion,
if you if you have these resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a responsibility to be
increasing the body of knowledge for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone, not just, you know, making
claims on bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say as a scientist,
you're more of like, I guess, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, a product atheist in the sense that
you're you're most interested in just
[SPEAKER_00]: furthering the amount of research and
knowledge in the industry around around
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular crop and Hawthorne is able
to provide you with a level of funding
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows you to do that research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let me clarify my position and with
the Hawthorne flower and everything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm I'm the director of plant science
at Flower, which is a licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically Hawthorne has partnered with
Flower to build this facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're experts in facility building,
management, cultivation, specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're probably the foremost experts in
the world in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my specific role is not necessarily to
to be doing the the Hawthorne research,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to ensure that everything like to work
with them to make sure everything they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing makes sense for in terms of cannabis
and not just, you know, not mums or
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamentals that maybe they've done
research with before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, so I'm not I'm not stuck
with any products or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure that science is
being done well and that it's widely
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable and that people can actually
gain something from all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't take my comments as trying to
give you a hard time about any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we I'm glad we touched on that
because I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something this is a
little bit of a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at research and how it's
funded, I think that's something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should always consider, too, when you're
looking at research is who's paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: that study and why are they doing that can
sometimes create a little bit of bias
[SPEAKER_00]: around results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's still more
useful to have that information out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and have something be peer reviewed,
I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, let's dive into these other
papers that I'm actually really excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do the propagation one or
the the stress testing that you did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk propagation first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, you want to just give me the
some of the what you set up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and what some of the highlights were
kind of the abstract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so so this trial came about
basically, you know, working with Vivo and
[SPEAKER_01]: working with other cannabis producers and
observing some of the the horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that they were doing as we were
doing other research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're working on the fertilizer
stuff and working on the growing media
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that some things maybe didn't
make sense to us as horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists and just with, you know,
basic understandings of plant physiology
[SPEAKER_01]: and propagation, for example, and what
with this paper, we looked at propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found some interesting practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those was that growers are often
cutting the tips of their of the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: off of their clones before they're cloning
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found that there was a lot of kind
of widely held, strongly held beliefs that
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to take cuts from a certain area
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just wanted to kind of,
you know, test it out and see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: right, because a lot of these growers have
been doing it for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their their knowledge is incredibly,
incredibly valuable, especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: absence of the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have nothing to base to base
our horticultural knowledge on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to kind of tease apart some
of these factors that growers were regular
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly choosing to go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did a fairly large trial on how
to improve the success and quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis stem cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at the cuttings or clones
looking at four factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at the number of leaves on the
plant, on the cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at whether the tips of the
leaves were removed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also looked at the position of the
cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either from the top or the bottom of
the plant, the apical or the basal region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at two rooting hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was an organic willow based extract
and one was a traditional IBA rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say the cutting the tips of
the leaves, you're talking about you
[SPEAKER_00]: define that as removing 30 percent of the
of the leaf from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers are going to know exactly
what you're talking about, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's something I did the very
first time I cloned, because I was told
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you were supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you find with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start off with the most
interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we found that cutting the tips
of the leaves in pretty much every
[SPEAKER_01]: situation reduced rooting success by about
20 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a plant scientist, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're damaging the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're causing a wound and you're reducing
the photosynthetic area in a way that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's also that's also you could decrease
the area, the number of leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is has the same effect of removing
the tips of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just looking at leaf area,
but you're causing a wound as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked to a lot of growers and
they've already changed their practices
[SPEAKER_01]: based on this publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really, really happy to find that
some of the other findings are also
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that in terms of rooting quality,
so not just if they rooted or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but kind of how many roots the plants
produce after they rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that two leaves had quite a bit
higher rooting quality than three leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: had higher rooting quality than two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found that the IVF VA based
rooting hormone drastically increased
[SPEAKER_01]: their rooting success, which we kind of
expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that there's not an
organic alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that this specific project
product didn't didn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the biggest finding there was
the the cutting of leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a huge one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way it was described to me was you
want to cut the leaf tips off because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want the plant to focus its energy on
rooting, not so much on photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that was why you're supposed to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what what you're what you're saying is
you do not science shows based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, do not cut the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two there was two reasons that
I heard for for doing for this practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is exactly what you just said is
focusing the energy of plants don't focus
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really how plants work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that makes a lot more sense
is just reducing clutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing in a dome,
if you're if you're rooting under a dome
[SPEAKER_01]: of high density, if you're using a rock
wall slab, for example, then you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to run into issues with damping off and
root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the leaves are really congested and
shading each other or touching each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's more likely that you're going to
proliferate these root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so reducing the leaf area makes a lot
of sense in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have fewer leaves, we found
that you don't have a lower rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: success rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just have a slightly lower root
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the way to mitigate that
problem is just to have fewer leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of actually damaging the roots,
because then you're even you're opening
[SPEAKER_01]: wounds to let the pathogens in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a whole other situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to remove an entire leaf
than it is to cut the leaf tips if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you didn't really touch on
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason I heard now that you kind
of reminded me was that they'll reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of, you know, transpiration and
humidity under that dome situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're when you're taking
cuttings, they don't have any roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with vegetative stem cuttings,
literally all the moisture to keep those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from wilting is coming from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do want to maintain very high
levels of humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that humidity comes higher
instances of root pathogens, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: also like that high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want it to be you want to be
humid with good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want the plants to kind of
be touching solid surfaces or touching
[SPEAKER_01]: each other, because then you have these
pockets of of condensation on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the worst situation for
root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we need to design our propagation
spaces to be a little bit better spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: in between the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than other other options for
controlling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers have moved towards that
and just spacing out their clones more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you need, you know, two or three
times larger propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've been working towards with
flower, which I can't discuss in too much
[SPEAKER_01]: detail, but it's just ways of mitigating
or controlling the environment such that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have those high densities and
still produce very high quality cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you have to do is, you know,
control the environment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from an organic perspective,
what do you think about the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing other types of organic rooting
hormones, things like what would might be
[SPEAKER_00]: found naturally in kelp or I know people
use a lot of mycorrhizal fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not convinced makes any
difference on in a cloning situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know some people have made claims
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to hear your opinions
around mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then aloe is another one that I've
seen a lot of people moving towards with
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about any of those as options
for at least some new research or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you know about them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I can say is that I didn't find
anything in the literature to suggest any
[SPEAKER_01]: other organic alternative rooting hormones
that actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that they don't work because
especially with organic, just like we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about previously, that it's very
hard to research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often people will just find a product
or practice and it'll work and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just continue doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of gets overseen by
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's probably something that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen anything else that works
anywhere near as well as an oxygen-based
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to see it if someone
figures something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need further research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing is essentially what
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, any other highlights from the
propagation one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we didn't touch on it for very
long, but I think you really nailed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the big points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to
highlight from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one small point that I didn't touch on
was that there was no difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting success or root quality based on
where you took your cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the apical region or the basal
region, the top or the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really interesting because
again, that's a commonly held belief that
[SPEAKER_01]: taking cuttings from the top of the plant
will give you a better rooting success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually founded on something
in other plants that is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this situation, it was not the case
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one other thing I want to touch
on too that you mentioned is, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a quote from your paper, cuttings from
juvenile plants generally have improved
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting over those from mature plants,
Altamura 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And juvenile plant material sometimes has
a higher content of endogenous oxens and
[SPEAKER_00]: other rooting promoters compared with
mature material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you quoted Houston and Powell 2006 on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's basically like what I
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other plants have more distinct mature
and juvenile regions that have,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, more distinct levels of hormones
such as oxens that will influence the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that they root when you take stem cuttings
from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that didn't appear to be the
case with cannabis, but it is a case with
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that there might be a case
for keeping mother plants for shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of time based on any research that
you've done in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping a mother plant for six months
versus changing out your mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on my research, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't seen any preference either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from experience, there is definitely
a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with a two, three year
old mother plant, there always appears to
[SPEAKER_01]: be difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason for that, I'm not really
not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if there's some kind of,
you know, genetic reason or if you just
[SPEAKER_01]: have increased viral load in the plants or
the plants just have these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulated levels of stress, which
changes some of the hormone levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another research question,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about this paper that I'm
probably most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're all really, really great
and interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, stress is such and stress
response is just such a fascinating topic
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little about the
trial that you set up or the study you
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's pretty well documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the literature that drought stress
specifically is a major stimulator of
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a recognizable example of this is
in herbs and spices that are grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: regions like the Mediterranean that are
semi-arid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have intermittent drought stress
and lots of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those factors are linked to more
aromatic herbs and abundant essential oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the literature, we didn't find
obviously anything on drought stress
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because there was, again,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to see if we could apply a
controlled level of drought stress to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and see if we can elicit some
positive response in terms of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: content in the dry flower or terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the general gist of what we
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so how did you determine the
parameters of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things you touch on is
how drought stress timing is also really
[SPEAKER_00]: important in terms of minimizing yield or
dry weight loss and maximizing your
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oil yield and concentrate of
these metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come up with the rates that
you did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, drought stress is an incredibly
complicated, complicated stress to apply,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I found in doing this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of ways you can apply
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about the timing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of just application of
drought stress, you want to reach a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to quantify stress, which is a
difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also apply the stress in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, like you were saying,
you can control the moisture content,
[SPEAKER_01]: the project that you're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control the moisture content to a
certain level and just maintain it at that
[SPEAKER_01]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one way of applying drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way is growing your plants in a
solution that has a very high level of
[SPEAKER_01]: salts and that that mimics drought stress
because the plants can't actually uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to replicate how
drought stress is, you know, happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, it's through gradual substrate
drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil, for example, would dry to a
certain point of time and the plant would
[SPEAKER_01]: experience stress incrementally over that
period with, you know, experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with very little stress and then
more and more stress until eventually the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are rewatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we wanted to mimic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of the timing, we,
so this was, you know, again, a
[SPEAKER_01]: preliminary trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first of its kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to do, you know, one
treatment that we thought would have the
[SPEAKER_01]: most effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at when, in general,
cannabinoids, you know, how they
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulate over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we picked the point of maximum
accumulation to be the point when we
[SPEAKER_01]: applied the drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fairly late in the flowering
stage for the cultivar that we use called
[SPEAKER_01]: nebula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when is that nebula cultivar typically,
typically harvested at what sort of day of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did you apply the stress level,
the drought stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe we harvested at nine weeks
after changing the late cycle and we
[SPEAKER_01]: applied the drought stress at week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I've seen, you know,
it's a common thread among growers while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're well, they'll stop watering for
the last week or the last few days or
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do make massive changes with the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even heard of people, you know,
changing the conditions in their grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: quite dramatically in terms of
temperature, all these different ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: triggering stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went with at seven weeks,
you allowed the plants to visibly wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that was one of your drought
stress indicators and at least the most
[SPEAKER_00]: practical one for growers to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you find when you did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK, in terms of the drought stress
threshold, so actually determining when
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants were stressed, we looked at
wilting, which again is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: growers can actually see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wilting, wilting response is not the
same between species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some plants will be very damaged before
they wilt and some will wilt way before
[SPEAKER_01]: they experience any permanent damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really you can't just assume
that it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good indicator of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find that it was a good indicator
in cannabis, which is useful now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but before we couldn't make that
assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use these these pieces of equipment
that are very high tech and pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment called in situ stem
psychrometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that was invented by
one of my advisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a device that connects directly
to the vasculature on the stem of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it measures in real time the plant
water, water status.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is effectively kind of like the
pulse of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it really needs water, the water
status will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even flick a leaf and you'll
see in real time a change in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: status.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of wilting, there's standards
in water status that will tell you if a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that as our drought stress
threshold and then applied that to wilting
[SPEAKER_01]: after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I wish I could play around with one
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's measuring essentially what's going
up and down through the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's somewhat there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's safflow meters, which measures
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is more measuring water status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a it's a metric of kind of the
water pressure of plant experiences,
[SPEAKER_01]: which a function function of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every kind of any change in the
environment will affect water status.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're you know, if you change your
increase your lighting, there'll be more
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure on the plant to transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you change your temperature,
your humidity or your vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit, all of that, all of that kind of
relates back into the water status of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very good accumulator of the
plant's response to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best that we know of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't even know that something
like that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also looked at relative leaf angle
as that's something that growers might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do as well as wilting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so based on your research, now you're
saying that cannabis does allow you to use
[SPEAKER_00]: wilting and leaf angle to show or
demonstrate drought stress, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was way too difficult to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so we found that when when the
leaf angle of if you look at a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: branch and you're looking at a fairly
large family, if the leaf when the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: angle of that family went from decreased
by about 50 percent from its original
[SPEAKER_01]: target angle, then it was at a level where
it was actually experiencing a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: level of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about plants, we talk
about plants praying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with their leaves pointing up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's across, you know, most cultivars
that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really, it's the tragedy of the
of the of the stammered leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that correlate with plant health
or is that something that you can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I can I can speculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's again, there's no research on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, that's a sign of just
really heavy transpiration and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration where the plant has enough
water and is actively transpiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a very high VPD in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really pushing out water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often you'll you'll see a correlation,
again, speculation, but between that and
[SPEAKER_01]: just very healthily transpiring plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so there there may be a correlation
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also I've also seen cultivars
that do that regardless.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point, then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's I want to talk more about stress
responses and the numerous stress
[SPEAKER_00]: stressors that can be in in a given grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, let's talk about your
results just relating to drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were your findings in this paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so after we gradually let the
substrate dry in our drought stress
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, we we found that the
photosynthetic rate was drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced over the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant was really suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we rewet it and we measured it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measured, you know, all sorts of
parameters during and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we confirmed that there was drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most interesting result was that
there was no difference in in the yield
[SPEAKER_01]: between the control and the drought stress
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some increases in some of
the important secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found that THCA concentration in the
drought treatment increased by 12 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA concentration by 13 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look on on.
[SPEAKER_01]: By by yield of the specific cannabinoids,
so grams per plant or grams per unit area,
[SPEAKER_01]: we found even even higher increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBDA was increased by or CBDA yield by
43 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDA yield by 47 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on, there was a lot of very
interesting increases by just applying
[SPEAKER_01]: drought stress once at week seven in the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much to add to that other
than I think it it shows just what what
[SPEAKER_00]: effect drought stress can have on your
overall yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we don't I don't know quite how to
apply that across other forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's just that's just
fascinating that you've got such a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to talk about kind of the
intricacies of that, because, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you say, to apply that elsewhere is in
this situation is even more difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the accumulated stress that
the plant perceives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, the stress,
like I said, it increases over time and it
[SPEAKER_01]: starts from very little to quite a
substantial amount of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the it's the accumulation of that
stress that the plant actually perceives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to go to wilting point in
a, you know, in a four inch rockwool cube,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, it would take a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the accumulated stress would be vastly
different from if you're working in a
[SPEAKER_01]: three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, you know, a peat based growing
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes a week before it gets to the
same wilting same wilting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to to consider
that, you know, don't just let your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: wilt, because it's not necessarily the
wilting that does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's a certain amount of stress
over a certain period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you apply, you know, if you get to
the wilting point in six or seven days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more likely to actually see the
benefits that we saw rather than doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a couple of days, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel that drought stress is
the best type of stress for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we even know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so one of the things I wanted to
talk about with you was there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of stress in any given
grow environment for a plant, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental with humidity and
temperature and BPD, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, watering, pest pressure,
you know, how do we as cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: what sort of applied science or knowledge
is there out there for how we sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: control these stress responses and which
may be beneficial and which may be
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental to yield health, all of those
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very, very interested in that
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress is a is a kind of dangerous tool to
play with as a grower because it's so easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to do damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intuitive that stress can be damaging
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even if you're doing it
late stage after it's fully grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen decreases in yield, decrease in
cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're over applying stress,
you know, late in the game or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially if you do it too
early, if you do it during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, almost across the board,
you're going to have decreased yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to be careful and do it
in a really controlled way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only apply one stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe anyone who says they,
you know, they can apply cold stress and
[SPEAKER_01]: salt stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drought stress all at the same time
and know how that's affecting their plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's vastly more complicated than I
think anyone understands right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to play with stress,
I would suggest one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, just work with one
stressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I just wanted to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I found from visiting a lot of
different facilities and such is that
[SPEAKER_00]: every facility has some form of stress
already occurring fairly regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these growth chambers that
you're creating are very hard to scale for
[SPEAKER_00]: for growers when we talk about commercial
production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that when we talk about,
you know, you mentioned applied science,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that come into play when we're
talking about a facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were a grower listening to
this talk and you're like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you mentioned stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start playing around with
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would sort of be your I mean,
you mentioned some cautions already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just trying to go with one form of
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the the rooms that I'm currently
operating in are kind of like large
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental growth chambers there,
you know, about fifteen hundred square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet of grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very, very controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of I'm fortunate that I can play
with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're operating in a less
controlled facility, the plants perceive a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the different stresses in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So salt stress, cold stress, drought
stress, they're all effectively just a
[SPEAKER_01]: different form of drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just limiting water uptake by
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have high levels of salt,
water uptake is restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that there's less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's drought, water uptake is
restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cold, the plants can't transpire
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's restricting water uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of it, a lot of them are
effectively the same stress and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just apply it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the easiest way, I think, is in using
the salt content in your growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do want to apply a drought
stress or you can just increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer content whenever you want to
apply that drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if you want to do it in
week seven, like we did in this paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could increase that to a point where
you're fairly confident that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a restricted uptake of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even let them get to wilting point
that way and then you can relieve the
[SPEAKER_01]: stress after the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working with your fertilizer or even
just adding salt into your fertigation
[SPEAKER_01]: mix, that could be one way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's kind of playing with fire
and it's best done in a very controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: setting and then scaled up later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would never recommend to a large
scale grower to just go and start playing
[SPEAKER_01]: with stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing about your trial that I
thought was an interesting decision you
[SPEAKER_00]: made was you were using the same level of
fertilizer in the water, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I read it correctly, and then the
plants that were drought stressed just
[SPEAKER_00]: received less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall they received less fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you said yields were the same
across both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could there potentially have been
over-fertigation in the other crop or does
[SPEAKER_00]: your other trial that you did sort of
validate the fact that the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: level was appropriate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's one of the intricacies
with doing drought stress trials because
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are, so for example, if you weren't
fertigating and you just didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporated fertilizer in both treatments
and you drought stressed one and not the
[SPEAKER_01]: other, then when the plant, when the
substrate has less water in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it also restricts nutrient uptake because
again, nutrients are mostly taken up with
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it that way or you can
fertigate where you're adding nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: every time you irrigate and that way,
again, if you're fertigating your control
[SPEAKER_01]: more frequently, it's getting more
fertilizer, but there's, I have never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: a drought paper that has any way of
mitigating that problem because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: always, those two factors, the fertilizer
uptake and water uptake are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very tightly connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our only kind of way of negating that
effect was to look at the other
[SPEAKER_01]: publications that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw that cannabis responds
similarly to fertilizer rate within a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw that both of our, the control
and the drought treatments fell within
[SPEAKER_01]: that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were fairly confident that it
probably did not influence the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus the fact that the drought treatment,
which received less fertilizer actually
[SPEAKER_01]: had higher yield and cannabinoid content,
which we were we would have seen probably
[SPEAKER_01]: based on our other publications that it
would have been the opposite because we
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't over-fertilizing the control in
any way.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, I think this kind of just
goes into some of the intricacies of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to design sort of a rigorous trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many variables that you
have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to consider that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's, uh, there, there are
definitely a lot of variables to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: in any horticultural experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to, when you're looking at
evaluating an experiment, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, before you know, jumping to any
conclusions, um, you, you have to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the methodology that they chose to,
because as a researcher, you're constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: making those types of decisions into how
you, how you're setting up a trial and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they have effects on your overall
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when we talk about stress,
you know, Anecdotally, I've, I've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the guy who has, uh, throws out
an old clone or something, or an old plan
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up growing massively and doing
way better out in the, this horrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, weather conditions versus their
controlled indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or it turns out being the sad looking
plant, but maybe has the, is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that they've ever grown,
you know, in terms of a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we know that stress has an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you feel like besides drought
stress, there's anywhere, any other areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of sort of stress response that we can
look at for increasing, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these, some of these, uh,
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that like, there's a lot of
different stressors that can have some
[SPEAKER_01]: positive impacts, but isn't it in most of
these cases, you'll see a reduced,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, reduced yield, but higher
concentrations of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, if that's what you want,
if you want like the most potent cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, then, you know, grow it healthy
for a little bit, stress it, you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: lower yield overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking that as a loss,
but then maybe you'll have more potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, more potent flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a cost benefit for most growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it's something to play with,
but if you are selling, uh, your flower by
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, which generally you are,
maybe they'll sell better if it's a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: THC content, but, um, still total volume
is by, is by yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then sometimes it's not, not best to apply
stress, but it's really up to the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of what they want to grow and how
they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my, my thoughts on this are every
facility has a lot of environmental stress
[SPEAKER_00]: already for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just as a general rule, there's no
perfect facility out there, at least that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm assuming that every plant is
receiving as much stress as it probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wants or needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the goal as, as someone who works
with in cannabis is to reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant stress we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthier plants, uh, less pest pressure,
you know, less, less drought stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those things, um, in terms of
increasing yield, because I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming that the plant is going to
receive stress from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause there's a lot of things that aren't
natural, uh, stressors in, in environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to talk about a cannabis,
you know, life cycle outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, we're looking at a plant
that's not cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't have its light cycle
switched in a, you know, in a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: period to something completely different
in the light and intensity ramped up so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think that factors into plant
stress or, you know, cultivation from a
[SPEAKER_00]: practical perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think the general rule of the best
to first reduce all the unwanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, stress in, in your growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if you're working in a greenhouse
that has variability and humidity from one
[SPEAKER_01]: side to the other, get rid of that stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: That variability first, uh, get rid of the
differences in light intensity across
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your canopy, make it as uniform as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get to a point where you're
fairly confident that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your canopy is uniform, you are growing,
you're not overly stressing out your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when you don't want to be, then there
might be benefit in applying controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until that point, like you say,
there's so many stress, uh, stressors that
[SPEAKER_01]: are already occurring, uh, to your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are unwanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not worth applying one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just your exercise caution at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what do you think about natural
versus sort of artificial stressors and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in relation to genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I was talking about with Ben
actually earlier, um, today about this in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these natural or sorry,
unnatural stresses in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning, uh, light changes that wouldn't
occur in nature, but plants may have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, certain cannabis plants may have
been, you know, evolutionary, so
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionarily selected for this based on
the way that we have been propagating and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding them, you know, indoors under
these lights for numerous decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you think that factors in when
we talk about it from like, say a genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a dangerous game to start
comparing how plants want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally compared to how we can grow them
in controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lab I worked with or I studied with
is controlled environment research
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grow, learn how to, you know,
we'd study how to grow plants in harsh
[SPEAKER_01]: climates and space and, and very,
very controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically decades of, of controlled
environment research have told us that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, if you can control the environment
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be exactly what the plant wants all the
time, it will grow much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have much higher yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll completely beat out nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not even any question about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a dangerous game to start
trying mimic to trying to mimic exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what nature does or how nature applies
stresses or how nature, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how plants grow in their natural
environments, because once you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: general understanding of how a plant grows
and you can start tweaking things like the
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 concentrations, the light intensity,
uh, you know, the light uniformity,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the, when plants receive light,
the spectrum of the light, all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can optimize all those parameters
in a, in a system that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, there's no question that you can beat
out nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been seen with, you know,
um, NASA research, trying to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best of there are wheat to the best
that it could possibly grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vastly superior to, you know,
yields you would see in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like steroids with humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about, uh, photo periodic,
uh, plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anything, any research,
uh, relating to that in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I know that's more specific to
cannabis than most horticultural crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I just be curious because,
because I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that we can't really
necessarily assume that mimicking nature
[SPEAKER_00]: has any, sort of advantage in terms of
yield or, or plant health, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we're able to do it quite well,
um, in these unnatural, what we're calling
[SPEAKER_00]: unnatural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but how, I guess for plants that may
be genetically, um, or evolutionarily
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up to be grown under a certain
environment, um, that seemed to thrive in
[SPEAKER_00]: this environment, is there any sort of
relation there in terms of other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been found to that are photo
periodic?
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been found to also, um,
maybe over time, um, have their genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: change for the better when we talk about a
specific type of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's been kind of,
regardless of that, it's been more kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, breeding selection for
cultivars that perform well in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environments that we're growing them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hasn't been done really in a
controlled way for cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to crops like wheat or corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still been done for decades and
decades where growers will, will find a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar that really responds well to
being triggered in 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in, you know, in a big phenotyping
project that we're doing now at Flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we've seen that some cultivars will,
will switch at, you know, 16 hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: some will only switch at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's likely that breeders at the
past have kind of just selected the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that respond well to the, the way that is
easiest or, you know, safest or most
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient to grow them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, I know we talked about a lot
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything you wanted to add
regarding the, the research that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done or anything you want to touch on in
terms of upcoming research that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited about that you can,
you're able to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in terms of upcoming research,
I'm definitely, that's been kind of on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now I'm acting as the
director of plant science at Flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a team of plant breeders,
engineers, growers, other horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, and kind of the potential and
the backing behind improving this crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: even just in my kind of closed circle,
is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so many people so interested
in, in learning about this crop and
[SPEAKER_01]: improving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much value in doing so for
a large group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a large scale producer like
Flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have production facilities all over the
world and one small improvement can mean
[SPEAKER_01]: huge increases in yield or in quality,
you know, in our Portugal operation where
[SPEAKER_01]: we have, you know, 165 hectares of outdoor
space or in our, in our local Kelowna
[SPEAKER_01]: production facility where we're growing
indoors and also in polytunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of effort being put
into research and there's so many low
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging fruit that we need to grasp for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I'm, what I'm
doing now and what me and my team is
[SPEAKER_01]: working on is trying to understand this
plant and how to grow it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be so much to learn in
such a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really, I really appreciate the
research that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, I thank you for sharing it so
openly and getting it peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that has a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you're just on the,
the, the cutting edge, sort of the tip of
[SPEAKER_00]: the iceberg for the amount of research
that is, that is going to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I'm really grateful that we're
starting to see this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I can have you back on to talk
more about it and some of your new
[SPEAKER_00]: research and maybe debunk some more of
these sort of myths or practices that may
[SPEAKER_00]: have not been beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned with the, the cutting
the leaves and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you having me on
and giving me a platform to, to share.
