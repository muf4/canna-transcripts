[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about moms, I know there
was another question about moms in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, in terms of how to best keep them
and what size container and some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that might be a good transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you guys touched on, the woody
stems is a big thing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants, every time you take a cut,
you're going to end up with more offshoots
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just becomes a nightmare over time
of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I think the health of the plant and
the viability of the plant goes down over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but just continual wounding and
pruning when we talk about a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of how people are storing
these plants, most of the facilities we
[SPEAKER_01]: work with are organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of them are in a range of
containers ranging from, I've seen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: small seven gallon, typically 20 or 30
gallon pots, collected elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go check out that tour on YouTube,
they did it, they did two plants in a four
[SPEAKER_01]: by eight bed with a trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the workflow on that is
better, but I have to say it's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: coolest looking mom rooms I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the challenge on the fertility side of
moms is what I wanted to touch on before
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really interesting because a
lot of us, with the soil beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that we like to grow and test with
beds and reinventing the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil testing every cycle,
that's really challenging with moms,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you keep moms for more than
a cycle or two, because it's one,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not going to be a lot of soil left
in that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly root mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, managing the fertility in that
pot with top dressing is really
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging in terms of keeping that mom
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And healthy moms is the most important
thing for your facility having success and
[SPEAKER_01]: even for home growers and having success
through flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're starting with a really healthy
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have a healthy mom,
I'm not going to start my next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where little things like fish
hydrolysis, a bottle of nutrient program
[SPEAKER_01]: with light doses come in really handy,
or even something like Jax, like a
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional salt based fertilizer in
small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are all just really effective
ways to keep your moms healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather, for example,
run Jax or use a bottle of nutrient line
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure I'm keeping my fertility up
in that 30 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Natalie trying to top dress as I see
deficiencies, knowing that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get into the plant for another
seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now my plant's stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to have to take cuttings off
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes a real hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every genetics, they're all going
to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't just say that here's a top
dress kiss kit for your moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to work for all your moms
because of the wide variety of genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a good question that was asked
in our Q&A list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of how I would address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does someone else want to add anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, when Dwayne put the question
forward, because I work at KISS and
[SPEAKER_03]: because I use KISS soil, and because I
regularly rotate my mom at least every
[SPEAKER_03]: three months, I know that I can keep a
nice, vigorous, healthy plant that was
[SPEAKER_03]: vegged in a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can throw that into a 10 or a 12 gallon
smart pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can run that in KISS Biochar water
only CGM for three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to see any deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant will be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the nutrient side of things,
calcium and phosphorus are the two that I
[SPEAKER_03]: try to make sure are on point for my moms
just as far as having the best propagation
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the two elements that show up
as being an issue if somebody is just
[SPEAKER_03]: caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your clones are not rooting,
first thing you want to do is get a scope
[SPEAKER_03]: out and look at your moms and make sure
you don't have russets or something
[SPEAKER_03]: horrible like that going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely something that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see propagation numbers drop off
with russets, but you'll also see it drop
[SPEAKER_03]: off with calcium.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it drop off with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the environment of the
propagation is not ideal, you've got super
[SPEAKER_03]: low relative humidity or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, because I'm doing regularly
rotating my moms, I like a 10 or 12 gallon
[SPEAKER_03]: smart pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like at least 450 for my PPFD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go as high as 600 for my moms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's adequate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just try to make sure I have enough
to cover my needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to make sure I've got cuts that I
don't need sitting around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to make sure I've got cuts
before I need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would always rather have a plant that's
a little bit bigger that I can trim back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That nice big root mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you've got small shoots and a
giant root mass and you throw it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bed, it goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shoots, almost no roots, and lost
power for two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it got cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everything is just moving a little
slowly this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as metrics, that's what I'm
shooting for for a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for us at the facility, we really
don't like to let them go more than really
[SPEAKER_00]: three months, maybe four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big reason for that is,
obviously, we've got a whole area ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not use it for just moms as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing to think about too,
guys, is plants are a lot like us in some
[SPEAKER_00]: respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones change over the years,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're young and ready to grow,
they're going to be moving stuff all over
[SPEAKER_00]: their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking cuttings from anywhere is going
to give you a really good shot at getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some really vigorously ready to go babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those moms get woody and older,
it's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fighting gravity more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things get woodier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the hormones change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot harder to clone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think it's also good to take
into consideration that we are growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even in the best of conditions,
let's say Southern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start your season in February,
they're flowering in August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even by then, I think that's a bit of
a long, you know, most people are looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at May to August, which is three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant's just ready to flower like
it doesn't want to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've found that I take biochar soil and
I'll either add a couple cups of bloom
[SPEAKER_02]: booster, or I'll just specifically add
fishbone and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I keep my moms in one gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely the bigger the pot,
the longer you can keep it happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in one gallons every two months,
I take the most atypical branch and I take
[SPEAKER_02]: it down about eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I use that to reset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that they don't skip a beat as
long as you use enough plant material and
[SPEAKER_02]: it has dominance because there's going to
be a higher concentration of oxens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're kind of taking the brain center
of the plant at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when that goes into the soil and
that roots, the amount of growth you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to see come off of that clone after
it's rooted is way more growth than you
[SPEAKER_02]: would see from trying to keep a mom for
six, seven months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is more work to continually reset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're watering not on point,
those one gallon pots can really kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say beds are the best,
but who's got beds available for each mom?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Thank you.
Thank you.
