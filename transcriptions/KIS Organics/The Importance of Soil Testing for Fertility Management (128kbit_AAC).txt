[SPEAKER_00]: I've just come to the realization how
important it is to test your soil at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we test, we kind of follow your guys'
SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for the audience, we work very
closely with Tad and his team,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We submit a soil sample around after eight
weeks in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of getting the same snapshot in
time of where rooms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to take different points in the
room just to try to get a general idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go off of Brandon's
recommendations or working with them being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, we need to get our yields up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we bump X, Y or Z up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's super critical,
especially in a commercial setting where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to hit certain metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be doing soil testing and you
need to be making sure that the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using are clean and tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're trying to do.
Thank you.
