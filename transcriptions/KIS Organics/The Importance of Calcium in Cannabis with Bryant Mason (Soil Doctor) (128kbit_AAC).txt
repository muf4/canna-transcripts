[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that there's a critical
growth period that's been identified in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production when calcium is needed
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it seems to me like it's
needed throughout the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's just a difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an apple, it's a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I generally believe that it's
especially needed in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's critically important to
maximize calcium uptake in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In organic production, I've never seen it
overdone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the reason that it's so
important in veg is not because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical point of influence, it's just
because you can't get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're at week four of flower,
you're not going to catch up if your
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium uptake wasn't high enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've sort of seen through years
of working with cannabis growers is the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest yielding plants have to have
enough calcium going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also believe that the lowest disease
pressure and just the best vigor and
[SPEAKER_00]: general plant health comes from sufficient
calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I like focusing on veg is
because you don't want to play catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, its movement is in the
transpiration stream, the water going up
[SPEAKER_00]: through the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just want to maintain that
stream of calcium throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life of the plant.
