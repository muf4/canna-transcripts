[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're back with the African worm
castings at 24 hours with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses added in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're starting to see some more
activity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to get some fungal
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a strand like this, probably every
other field of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if this were a T, I'd want it
to go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 24 hours right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that your field of view is,
or through this video, is a lot smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: than my actual field of view through the
eye pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see if we zoom in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it looks like we have pretty
good morphological diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different shapes of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
