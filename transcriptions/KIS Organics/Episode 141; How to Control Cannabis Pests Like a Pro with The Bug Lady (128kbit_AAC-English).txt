[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is my good friend,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, also known by
[SPEAKER_00]: many as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_00]: primary focus on biological control and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne has been on the podcast multiple
times and I highly suggest folks go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to some of our other podcasts
if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her website is bugladyconsulting.com where
you can find links to other podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars, and information as well as how
to contact her for direct consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is great to be back and to talk with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so before we get started,
I did want to mention that you and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been working in the background along with
Adam over at Collective Elevation and his
[SPEAKER_00]: team to throw a conference next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want people to mark their calendars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working out a lot of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on September 5th, 2025, we're going to
have a workshop with Suzanne as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 5th through the 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 5th and the 6th will be the
conference at Collective Elevation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bozeman, Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 7th is going to be some sort
of tasting event with the Living Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance Montana group that will be
included for folks going to the conference
[SPEAKER_00]: and then open up to some of the public as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the plan, but I want to get a
lot of the people from the podcast to the
[SPEAKER_00]: conference to speak, a lot of my favorite
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you wanted to add,
Suzanne?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I am super excited too because A,
Montana, B, Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love going to Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've been out to Collective
Elevation and they've always been super
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be a lot of fun,
a lot of good education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be given the opportunity to
actually teach a workshop more interactive
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cannabis growers because
oftentimes I'm just doing a presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this I want to be a bit more
interactive that we're going to do on
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be great and I'm
really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we dive into this podcast,
I know we're kind of going to jump around
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit on topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to touch on
briefly because in my indoor garden this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, I've never had an issue with,
I've been calling them isopods,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we should probably touch on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These woodlouse, roly-poly, armadillo-like
creatures, I'll let you pronounce the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific term, the Latin names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the amount of organic
matter in my soil and I don't use,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in raised beds and I'm not using a
cover crop or a mulch and we can touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I posted about them and I saw a whole
list of comments replying to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything ranging from you need to feed
them separate from your plants so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't attack your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this seems to be a problem that's
pretty common among living soil growers
[SPEAKER_00]: from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the ones that I see having this
problem are ones that have mulches or
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it as much with people like
myself who just have bare soil and are not
[SPEAKER_00]: using those practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, some of the suggestions were
everything from squash or pumpkin or beer
[SPEAKER_00]: traps to kind of mass trap or collect them
in one spot or feed them separate from
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are putting sticky tape or
wraps around the stock of their plant as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of keeping the insects from walking up
the plant or girdling the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen a bunch of different
suggestions around how to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the suggestions was Pyganic 5.0,
which is a pyrethrin and I definitely want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to you about pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, they're not insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be an insect, you have,
as an adult, six pair of legs and ten eye,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you look at this group,
which they are a kind of isopod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isopod incorporates a lot of different
animals out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some specific families that
these, I'm going to call them generic
[SPEAKER_01]: roly-polies because there are a lot of
different regional names for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like how some people call lightning
bugs and fireflies different names,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's the same kind of thing that
there's a lot of different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, woodlouse is often used a little
more, I don't want to say scientific,
[SPEAKER_01]: than roly-poly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they get their name, roly-poly,
a bunch of them, because they can roll up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the group that you have the
armadilloidae, which it makes sense
[SPEAKER_01]: because they roll up like armadillos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is kind of where they rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did do a little checking because I
am not a roly-poly expert, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I work more with insects and
mites and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks like none of them are
actually native to North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say, if you look up isopods,
of course there's native isopods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the genuses of the ones that growers
are using, or a lot of them that are found
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, are not native.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been either a, brought in
accidentally with soil, from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediterranean region, from Europe,
other parts of the country, or by people
[SPEAKER_01]: buying them and then them escaping,
or people dumping out their soils when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're done with a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a tough thing because a lot
of them now have been here in North
[SPEAKER_01]: America for, you know, quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are kind of established in the
ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are kind of indigenous,
but they're not naturally native.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I get real squirrely about,
you know, moving animals around without
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper permits and without the
research that's been done proving that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay to move them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because historically a lot of mistakes
have been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, to get permits from the USDA is a
multi-year, very painful process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much from, you know,
the spectrum that I, the side that I
[SPEAKER_01]: worked on with the biological control,
we're not getting anything new into the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S.
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it's a species that's here already.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been well documented here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as far as management goes,
I don't think anybody's really surveyed to
[SPEAKER_01]: know exactly which species are causing
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: In them, because I'm going to guess it's
not just one species of roly-poly out
[SPEAKER_01]: there because of people coming from
different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I know some people buy them and
release them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had numerous growers contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, there seems to be
that common denominator of the heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching because I think that provides a
perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you go outside, whatever you
pull up your mulch, you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: roly-polys down under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are, they basically are
decomposers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's what mulch does on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's decomposing between the media and the
actual mulch layer itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, it does create a perfect
habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is with anything,
too much of a good thing is not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the numbers can get out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've actually seen them feed
on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as control, honestly,
I mean, I hate to say it, the growers I've
[SPEAKER_01]: worked up, we've kind of ended up
vacuuming a lot out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of understand the idea if
you provide an alternate food source that
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll feed on that and not so much your
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a gamble because you don't
always know, again, what species,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the environment is and what they
prefer on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And providing them a perfect habitat with
a lot of food for reproduction can just
[SPEAKER_01]: really boost their numbers even higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which could create a bigger issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a home grower and just have a
few plants and you can put sticky collars
[SPEAKER_01]: around the base of your plants for
trapping, that can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that we've had,
when people have used products like
[SPEAKER_01]: Tanglefoot, it creates a moisture layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen where the plants have tried
to grow roots out in that area and it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also when you start getting into
trapping like that, it's non-selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can catch good things as well as
bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're relying on predatory mites
to be able to run up and down the stalks
[SPEAKER_01]: of your plants and things like that,
you may end up trapping some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to acknowledge the health
officials there on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I touch on something?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we're talking about these roly
polys right now is that they're a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are classified as a pest of minor
importance by some of these universities
[SPEAKER_00]: and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, they do have a lot of benefits
to soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to acknowledge that in the
healthy ecosystem, a lot of times you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find them in proper quantities or
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do, like you said, they do have a
very decomposing sort of behavior where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll eat dead plant material,
shred it, break it down further,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows microbes to better access the
carbon and such in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will help mineralize soil and
mineralize organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some benefits to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when they get out of control in these
indoor systems, I think, that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be surprised to see a lot of
issues outdoors with roly polys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in times of drought, if you have,
again, crops with water content in them
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking for moisture,
to feed on, that sometimes can drive some
[SPEAKER_01]: unusual behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, when it's outside, you have
predators of them to keep them in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, again, it's a numbers game,
which, you know, everything, it's keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is true with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, hey, an aspirin is great for
a headache, but if you eat an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle, it's going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the same thing like with roly
polys, to have the proper number around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're taking them out of their
ecology, that complete ecology,
[SPEAKER_01]: and force them into a very artificial
ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what's tough is people are
trying to create outdoors indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're missing a lot of the key
elements, where you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: predators, you don't have frogs,
you don't have lizards, you don't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm sure there are some, I guess they
technically wouldn't be intimal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would probably be armadillidae
pathogens, that keep them in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even flooding, oh, you know, some of them
die because they've drowned, or drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are trying to cherry pick just
a few things from the ecology they think
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be good for their soil,
because we've been told they're good for
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, but there's so many pieces of
the puzzle we're missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the wheel doesn't run as smoothly
as it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I often think about how
important wind and rain is for plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, and when you bring them inside,
you don't get that natural, every time it
[SPEAKER_01]: rains, you know, kind of leaching the soil
out and washing the soil and adding that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't have that in an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can appreciate and understand the
direction and what growers are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, and I get that, I just think we need
to think bigger about not just cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: picking a few things and throwing them in
and being like, yeah, now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have this, you know,
healthy soil with missing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've talked about this with other
people on the show, and on my social
[SPEAKER_00]: media, this idea of biomimicry that people
are trying to create indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, it's a lovely idea that I
think resonates with me emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, ecology is very
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity is so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, us adding in, you know, 10 more plants
in the form of cover crops into our indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden does not suddenly create an ecology
that's going to match what we would see
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that, like you mentioned,
is we don't have the same pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: are helping control some of these,
you know, insects or roly polies or other
[SPEAKER_00]: biota that we have in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a really good point that
you brought up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pyrethrins, because I was
trying to remember in my head,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking I know they're derived from
chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you don't like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I don't really or you don't
usually recommend them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have recommended them for the right
usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, I think with cannabis,
because of their limited access to
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides for the legal growers,
I think pyrethrins just have been overused
[SPEAKER_01]: because of lack of access or not access,
but the legality of using other
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think people, you know,
have this idea just because something
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from a plant, it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all should know better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the so is the issue with pyrethrins
mostly overuse in the sense of pest
[SPEAKER_00]: developing resistance to it, or are there
other potential risks or non-target
[SPEAKER_00]: organism effects if you were to use them
for, like, say, drenching the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I did find one article talking
about isopods showing avoidance behaviors
[SPEAKER_00]: to soil that was contaminated with
pyrethrins versus a soil that was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't able to find anything
directly saying that they would kill
[SPEAKER_00]: isopods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you mentioned, you know,
pyrethrins do come from chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how this all got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are basically the effect for insects,
their nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where most of the research has
been done on insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it affects their sodium channels,
it affects their nerves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they lose, I mean, if you watch an
insect die after exposure to a pyrethrins,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they get kind of twitchy because
their muscles just kind of fire and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they just kind of die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, humans, you know, discovered this,
this is like such a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I mean, and, you know,
I'm not gonna knock pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can argue that they've been
completely bad, but also everybody enjoys
[SPEAKER_01]: having cheap food today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of our cheap food
system has to do with the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and allowing us to grow a lot
of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pyrethrins themselves growing enough
chrysanthemums to extract the pyrethrins
[SPEAKER_01]: out is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why humans developed synthetic
pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the products you get in
things like bifenthrin, which are used a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot for structural pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live, or if you grow plants in the
southeastern portion of the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas, up towards, I think we're now
hitting up to Virginia, and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: transport plants, you have to incorporate
bifenthrin, which is one of the synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrethroids into the media, because
synthetic pyrethroids are really good
[SPEAKER_01]: repellents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this keeps the fire ants from going
into the pots and it repels them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it in the Pacific Northwest to
keep weevils out of containerized plants
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why they use it a lot for structural pest
management around windows and doors is
[SPEAKER_01]: because an insect walks up and they're
like, boop, don't wanna be either of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it repels them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pyrethrin, pyrethroids,
yes, there's definite repellency qualities
[SPEAKER_01]: to these chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when humans developed the synthetic
pyrethroid compounds, and they started in
[SPEAKER_01]: all the homeowner products, turf people
use them, nurseries used them,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody used them, resistance happened
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of resistance to this
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that it's very
important to understand with resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because you've never used a
chemistry, that doesn't mean the insects
[SPEAKER_01]: or mites you have have not been exposed to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very possible for you to get,
never have used a pyrethrin, and you spray
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it didn't work, that's because the
insects you have gotten have a history of
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure, even though you have unexposed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the very famous problems we've
dealt with in the United States is when we
[SPEAKER_01]: got Bemesia whitefly here in the United
States, and it was resistant to many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't because of what was sprayed
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Spain, because they have large
greenhouse systems there, they had used
[SPEAKER_01]: the synthetic pyrethroids I'm sorry,
sorry, they use the neonicotinoids very
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those whiteflies made it here
from Spain, they were resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the resistance we have can come from
other countries and other regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, with the pyrethrins,
pyrethroids, pyrethrins are the natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrethroids are the synthetic version.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been cheap, they've been used for
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is, so my concern one is
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something you can just spray
over and over and use over and over in
[SPEAKER_01]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it, you would definitely will
develop resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, they're definitely
non-selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it doesn't, you know, it's not like
the chemistry's ascension being that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, hey, you know, mite or hey,
aphid or hey, ladybug, are you good or
[SPEAKER_01]: bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm only gonna kill the bad one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very non-selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my next concern is persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually, you know, talked to the
researchers that have worked a lot with
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural pyrethrins and they talk about
how quickly they break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked like under what conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they've looked at is outdoor row
crops, you know, in the sun, in the rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it does break down quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started asking about, well,
what if it's, you know, indoor grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't, there's no irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sub-irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hasn't been, it seems like a lot
of work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did get some information like when
it's used in stored grains to keep stored
[SPEAKER_01]: grain pests out in cooler temperatures in
the dark like that, it can persist for
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know indoors in cannabis,
we have done some leaf tissue analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: where pyrethrins were sprayed and we
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even at three weeks out, there was
still very low, but there were still
[SPEAKER_01]: detectable levels of pyrethrins on the
foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any health risks or REIs
associated with pyrethrins or pyrethroids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have REIs because they are
registered pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that concerns me
sometimes with the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: because not all cannabis growers carry
pesticide licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to me, what's important about
the pesticide licensing is learning and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how to read pesticide
labels, understanding REIs, post-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: intervals, what PPE is required.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people are like,
oh, it's, you know, big government,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, trying to take control.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're trying to keep you from
killing yourself because these are
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, they can kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, I mean, that's what they're
designed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, again, it's a dosage thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're spraying pyrethrins,
you know, is it going to kill you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that I think about is the
long-term low dose exposure of constant
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, again, outdoor, in a row crop
environment where you've got rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight, microbial activity, so many
things are going on, things break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you go into an indoor grow
environment, which is not like outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we fully understand how
chemistries break down in those
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, how they persist in those
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would not say not to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if it's something that was the right
use, you followed the labels, you wore the
[SPEAKER_01]: right PPE, you weighted the proper REI,
the reentry interval before you entered
[SPEAKER_01]: back in or your employees, you know,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't just go using pesticides
willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought up two things that I think are
worth spending a little more time on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't, I wasn't aware that makes a
lot of sense about how things would break
[SPEAKER_00]: down much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors and outdoors and how that might
increase exposure or even potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination on the leaf tissue itself of
the final cannabis product in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the two things I want to talk a little
bit more about was REI, which is return
[SPEAKER_00]: entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're, we're talking about that,
what that is, it's on a pesticide label
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you how long you need to stay out
of that space before you can go back into
[SPEAKER_00]: it without PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: After spraying, pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct, Suzanne?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it, it, it, and this is the
crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, you're given these REIs and it's for
your employees to stay out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, one of the problems I have
with this rule is that it doesn't imply,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't apply to non-employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a garden center,
and you want to come in and spray a
[SPEAKER_01]: product with like a four hour REI,
your employees can't go back to those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for four hours, but your customers
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and that's, I, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to guess, you know, there was
probably some weird lobbying or something
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, for, for the public,
and this is why there's been some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to put the lawn,
the signs on your lawns posting that this
[SPEAKER_01]: was sprayed with a chemistry kind of
thing, because I think people need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: aware, but that doesn't apply in all
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that, you know, is something
that has to be requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, that you get notification
of it and every, every state is different
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on that notifications for those
outdoor applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that REI is very important because
again, that's, that's what the government
[SPEAKER_01]: has deemed is safe for your employees to
go back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's interesting because in the United
States, a lot of the newer stuff has four
[SPEAKER_01]: hour REIs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Older chemistries, you'd see REIs as long
as 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, my, most of my ornamental growers
don't want anything more than four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 is really different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really difficult because that means
their employees can't go into that
[SPEAKER_01]: facility for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think with cannabis, because of
just the hands-on nature of the way people
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, I think sometimes those REIs are
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's from lack of
understanding on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had reached out to you because someone
in a Reddit forum had suggested a product
[SPEAKER_00]: at another, you know, organic supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't familiar with the product and
someone said, Oh, just apply this and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll fix your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make a video around this
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to give it all away on the
podcast, but essentially I sent it to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and you said, Oh yeah, this, this has been
around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a 48 hour REI and I guarantee,
I mean, because these guys sell stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly to home growers, I guarantee most
people either don't know that or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not waiting two days to go look at their
indoor plants again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No home grower I know of does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, it's scary to me to
think about what people might be exposing
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I look forward to working
with you on maybe clarifying some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: label terms in a, you know, a short series
or something video series in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to go back and reread that
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause again, I mean that product's been
around for decades and it's just never
[SPEAKER_01]: gained traction because the long REI,
but I, it may require a respirator for
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of pesticides, you need a
respirator and the government now you
[SPEAKER_01]: need, you need a respirator that's custom
fit to your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get leaks in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's all about keeping the
stuff out of your, your lungs and your
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know of any home grower that
is custom fitting respirators.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouses and stuff I work with,
they, they have, you know, checks where
[SPEAKER_01]: they check the respirators to make sure
they fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have training classes on how to teach
people how to check to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: these respirators fit and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this has kind of been a big
driver for more bio control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't have these respirator
requirements and as more products get
[SPEAKER_01]: longer REIs, even though again,
new products tend to have shorter ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go up to Canada, Canada is just not
even giving things shorter than really 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hour REIs anymore, just because they don't
want anybody in there for 12 hours after a
[SPEAKER_01]: product's applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States is pretty liberal and we
have some pretty short REIs compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it's really important to
protect your lungs and yourself because
[SPEAKER_01]: again, even though they come from plants,
some of these are synthetic chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they are, they are pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just double checked on the US EPA
website and on this product and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the REI is 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I go to the website for the
product, it says, Oh, it's a food safe
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide, but it might decide that
provides fast ensure biochemical control
[SPEAKER_00]: for a wide range of problem pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the safest soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes no skin irritation to humans,
livestock or pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you get in your eyes,
just flush your eyes with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's like getting soap in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the FAQs on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to the EPA site,
a 48 hour REI is 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of scary to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a big disconnect
between what they're putting on their
[SPEAKER_00]: website and what looks like a totally safe
organic EPA certified product versus
[SPEAKER_00]: what's on their actual label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say sometimes when products
come to market for the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might have in our high REI,
but then if the product more research is
[SPEAKER_01]: done, they can come back and come back in
with a lower REI on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I've known about this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's never been lowered in 20
years, it's, I, there's something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what it is about the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, if I can't, no one I know
will use a 48 hour product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, I didn't even know this was
still on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of surprised when you contacted
me that it had, it had resurfaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, but the only place I could see a 48
hour REI is outdoor row crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got the tractor,
it will go out and spray it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to worry about people
being out there working because those
[SPEAKER_01]: crops will grow for weeks, if not months,
and nobody's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in a greenhouse,
a nursery, a cannabis facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's going to be in there and more
than 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because we were talking about
pyrethrins, Pyganic, which can be a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good product in the right situation,
that one does have a 12 hour REI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to use Pyganic,
you have a 12 hour reentry interval after
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it before you, your employees
can, you should be back in there.
Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing I wanted to touch on
that you had brought up was essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: non-target organism effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea that when we apply any,
or any pesticide, anything side that kills
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that it's just going to kill
our target pest and not impact other
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial or innocuous organisms in our
systems is, is flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for an example, one recently was,
I saw people were using mustard meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, to mustard seed meal to kill
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started looking into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will kill fungus gnats,
but it's also going to kill other
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that may be cycle nutrients that
have other benefits in your soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of wanted to just touch on
non-target organism effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some things that are very
targeted that we can use too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of like Bavaria, for example,
in this regard as being a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted than say, you know, some of these
broadcasted things like mustard meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this is, this is a challenge in a
way for people that want to be sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: and care about the environment because the
newer synthetic pesticides that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to the market, Salton is a very good
example from BASF.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only kills a few species of spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites are a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do anything for broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do anything for russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, it's the way it works is very
targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is one of these newer chemistries
that we can use over top of predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: mites and it has no impact on the
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, other than the water washing
action, if you were going to spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you were to spray a leaf,
put the predatory mites, persimilis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucumbera, Swirsky, they all just can go
on and live their happy lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, again, the broad mites,
would because it doesn't affect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemical companies are really dialing
very specific targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like Endeavor is another synthetic
chemistry and it affects the mouth parts
[SPEAKER_01]: on white flies and aphids because their
mouth parts are kind of like turkey baster
[SPEAKER_01]: bulbs, you know, simplify,
oversimplifying, but it stops that muscle
[SPEAKER_01]: from being able to work so they can't
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's very targeted on those
groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are more from nature,
the pyrethrins, soaps and oils even,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are non-selective and they will just
come in and kill everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bavaria, even though it can be more
targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bavaria bassiana is a fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We consider an intimal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does kill insects, but if you
start looking at labels, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: there's numbers or letters after them
because we have different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like with cannabis, there is with
these fungi and the different strains can
[SPEAKER_01]: affect different pests differently and
different insects differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though Bavaria bassiana,
GHA is the most common found one,
[SPEAKER_01]: will not kill everything when you apply
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will kill some of your beneficials,
like it will kill aureus, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: considered much safer with predatory mites
as long as you use the wettable powder
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really getting into the deep
into the pool because then you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start looking at formulations and how they
affect things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally stuff that's approved for
organic farming is, is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: non-selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kill good and bad where when you're
looking at sustainability and being very
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted and killing specific pests,
some of the newer pesticides actually are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, they're better for your bio
programs and to preserve your ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now most of these what I consider designer
pesticides cannot be used in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are being used in ornamental and
vegetable production because we can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: our beneficials going, come in,
target with these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes sadly, again, pyrethroids or
pyrethrins, the natural ones, are
[SPEAKER_01]: non-selective and they will wipe out the
beneficials that you do have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BTs, which have been around for
decades now, BT stands for bacillus
[SPEAKER_01]: thuringiensis and same thing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have multiple species, there's
israeliensis, there's zowie, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: galeria, and each of these is very
targeted for groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The israeliensis is very targeted on flies
and that's what we have commonly used for
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus snap management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that we can use to
target fungus gnats that can work fine in
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction with beneficial nematodes,
soil dwelling predatory mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the crustacean is used for
caterpillar management, but just like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else, you use it too much and
there are resistance issues with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this fine line because I love
beneficial insects, that's no big secret,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've committed my whole life to this,
but sometimes it's these synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted pesticides that actually are,
I think, from a sustainability option,
[SPEAKER_01]: a better targeted choice than going in
with a broad spectrum pyrethrin that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna kill everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you're okay with killing
everything because you need to do a reset,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just want to kill everything and get
back in pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so something like that where you go
and knock, it's called a knockdown spray
[SPEAKER_00]: or essentially trying to get levels back
down to a point where you could come back
[SPEAKER_00]: in with beneficials or something that's a
little bit gentler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you notice, let's say, for example,
you weren't scouting in your indoor space
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden you realize you have
spider mites and they've gotten out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control, you may want to come in and do,
and we're not too far into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to set all these different
parameters, then you could come in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: knockdown spray and essentially suffocate
or kill a lot of them and then follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a beneficial application of the
right beneficials to potentially deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the little ones that you weren't
getting and then move forward with your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just doing that knockdown spray
because it is very difficult today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm sure there's gonna be pushback
when I say this, to manage pests just with
[SPEAKER_01]: spray programs because you don't get the
spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing just a spray program,
obviously it has to be done regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're just keeping your numbers in
check with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with that, if you use the same
mode of action repeatedly, with there are
[SPEAKER_01]: a few exceptions, typically we don't see
resistance issues with soaps, oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Bavaria bassiana, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, pyrethrins, BTs, if you're
conscious, constantly using those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you definitely will develop resistance to
repeatedly using those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your program can get out of
check, your problems get out of control,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you wanna come and do a knockdown
spray, but your product's not working
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
