[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the peat moss with alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to find any fungal growth on
this slide, but you can see quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria cruising around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great shot of a peat leaf if you
ever wondered what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we zoom in
[SPEAKER_00]: to 400 times magnification, you can really
see that bacteria cruising around nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is nothing but peat moss,
some terapeete actually in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of alfalfa meal in
distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their only food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, even though the peat was
pretty dehydrated, pretty good bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks great.
Okay, here we go.
Okay, here we go.
