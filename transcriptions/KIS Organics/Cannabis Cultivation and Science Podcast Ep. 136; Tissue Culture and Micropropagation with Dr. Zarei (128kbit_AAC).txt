[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Dr. Adele Zarray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zarray earned his PhD from Leiden
University in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: specializing in molecular mechanisms
governing defense and secondary metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zarray spent a decade as a research
associate at the University of Guelph,
[SPEAKER_01]: where his research focused on stress
physiology in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: His primary passion lies in the study of
plant secondary metabolites, many of which
[SPEAKER_01]: possess pharmaceutical significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, Adele transitioned to the
cannabis industry, serving as a scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor and cannabis micro-propagation
expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: He played a pivotal role in designing and
establishing multiple cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: micro-propagation labs for cannabis
production license holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: His groundbreaking work in this field
garnered multiple government grants and
[SPEAKER_01]: led to the development of commercial-scale
cannabis micro-propagation techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results of this research were
published in prestigious peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: journals including in-vitro cellular and
development biology and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout his career, Adele has authored
more than 22 peer-reviewed articles
[SPEAKER_01]: covering topics such as plant stress
physiology, secondary metabolites,
[SPEAKER_01]: and plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zarray is an integral member of the
PharmaCrop team, serving as the chief
[SPEAKER_01]: operating officer at PharmaCrop in
Queensland, Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this role, he oversees operations that
encompass every stage of the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed cultivation to the final
production of medical grade cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zarray has successfully transferred
his extensive knowledge and experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation and processing of medical
cannabis into Australia's burgeoning
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Zarray, thank you so much for joining
us on the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Tat, for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was so excited to meet you in
Melbourne, Australia, at the Pharma Out
[SPEAKER_01]: conference because you have such a
wonderful research background in tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and micro-propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that
background and what your area of expertise
[SPEAKER_01]: is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I earned my PhD degree from Leiden
University back to 2002 in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during my PhD program, I really
studied the molecular mechanism of
[SPEAKER_02]: defense, how a plant can defense itself
against the adverse environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fascinating experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What genes involve and what the product
plan make to battle and cope the adverse
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2007, I moved to Canada and at the
University of Guelph and I studied
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary metabolite pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's worse that I explained what is
the secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant as an autotrophic organism making
primary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metabolites and secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primary metabolites like a protein,
carbohydrate and fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make it for growth and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: But secondary metabolite is the bunch of
molecules plants make it just to prepare
[SPEAKER_02]: itself against biotic and abiotic
stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was very interested to learn more
about the pathway and actually it turns
[SPEAKER_02]: also out that the cannabinoid is one of
the secondary metabolites was made and is
[SPEAKER_02]: made in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those molecules, plant doesn't make it
just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making it to just get them ready
against herbivores, different pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens and also abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, again, a very exceptional
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once about the 2017 when legalization
happened in Canada, I was following the
[SPEAKER_02]: news and movement to the legalization and
also study the science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that there's not much science is
behind cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason was, I think now is very
obvious because cannabis used to be
[SPEAKER_02]: control substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, there was no much research
group had access to cannabis plant to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has prompted me to write a few grants
and get the fund from government of
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started tissue culture research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of those tissue culture
research, three peer review journal paper
[SPEAKER_02]: came and published in the three different
journals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we learned a lot about how we can do
the tissue culture and how tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: can serve the new industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, because now after those years of
experience, I was also able to establish a
[SPEAKER_02]: company can know and serve the different
license holder to establish and design lab
[SPEAKER_02]: and also equip them with the different
equipment necessary for tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_02]: also train their staff member.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point now, currently, I'm actually
in Queensland, Australia, and I'm working
[SPEAKER_02]: with the pharma crop and the new license
holder for cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually holding position of the chief
operating officer to make sure from the
[SPEAKER_02]: seat to say we incorporate science and we
bring the new techniques for the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: product for the medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long career adventure,
but it's just all the steps was very
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable for me and was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we talked about how you and your
family have had to uproot and travel quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit on this academic journey you've been
on over the last decade or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's yeah, that's really commendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to touch on really quickly,
there are three papers that you've written
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been peer reviewed and published
in journals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one is called cannabis synthetic seeds
and alternative approach for commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: scale of clonal propagation and germplasm
conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another in 2022 as well that was published
called improvement of mineral nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: and rooting efficiency of cannabis sativa
for in vitro large scale propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third that is cannabis
sativa, photoautotrophic micro
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation, a powerful tool for
industrial scale in vitro propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, those are all mouthfuls of titles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to read those papers and I love
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we go ahead and talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we go back to the very beginning of
this process though for people and just
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit about what is tissue
culture in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant tissue culture is a technique of
growing plant cell tissue or organ in an
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial and astral environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you put the piece of the plant
tissue on an enriched medium and let them
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually we are able to first induce
some shoots from this X plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The piece of the tissue we are putting on
a medium, we call it X plant, so-called X
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will able to usually, yes,
X plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we usually able to grow them in the
shoot form.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, and then we can dissect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can also put them in the
separate medium to induce rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually the whole miniature form of
the plant will be created in the astral
[SPEAKER_02]: jar and in the astral environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the meaning of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This X plant can be taken from petiole,
can be taken from leaves and can even
[SPEAKER_02]: flower or other part or segment,
like a segment of a stem, including buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In cannabis, very rooting form,
which is a much easier form, is just
[SPEAKER_02]: taking half, five millimeter to six
millimeter of the segment of the shoot,
[SPEAKER_02]: which carries one single bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically when you are inserting to the
medium, after, of course, after
[SPEAKER_02]: esterization, they proliferate and make a
tree to for shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can dissect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then because you can dissect it,
you can imagine it's happening in two to
[SPEAKER_02]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine every period of two,
three weeks, you can from one single node,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can make a four branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after four branch, after following a
period at the second cycle, you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: from four, you can get 16 and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the, this is the call of meaning
of micro propagation, which is a section
[SPEAKER_02]: under tissue college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tissue culture, which is a common
practice in the horticultural industry
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we use tissue culture with numerous
plants, though cannabis seems to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more challenging and a little
bit unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to dive into that, but this
idea of tissue culture is taking a small
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of plant material and then
extracting it from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then essentially in, in a test tube,
more or less, or, you know, cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: media, growing out this plant again,
from just a tiny amount of tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so micro propagation, if I understand
correctly, then is this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exponential process that allows
you to create a whole bunch of these
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny plants that could then be put
into production in a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_01]: or commercial environment down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the benefits of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe not the main benefit,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at micro tissue culture, as you said,
it has a history of the decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it started massively from the even 60
and 70 from different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some species was in danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientists found its formulation for
medium to conserve them in the in vitro
[SPEAKER_02]: condition, in the vessel jars to just save
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has been over decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many species formulation has been
developed for cannabis back to 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, once we, we had access to 50
different strains and we were quite
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to finish a lab and, and put them
on the tissue culture medium based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: available formulation was published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very soon, we found out, oh,
most of those strain do not grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show, they show a stunted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, they shows degree of
malformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show also a translucent leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it very dark green, dark green
with the very translucent appearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it, which is a sort of malform,
malformality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it hyperhydricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, we were actually,
we were quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So majority of them, they are not growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are just survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, they die out in the
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has prompted me to develop a mimic of
conventional propagation for an inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: aseptic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first paper is a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you mentioned it about the
autotrophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it autotrophy micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just mimic the conventional method.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know as conventional method for
commercial propagation of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: through the cutting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So piece of branch will be taken with the
piece of also attached leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, if we put them in the Jiffy pot or in
the rock food, in the humid condition for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for two to three weeks, they get rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds very easy, very, very, very cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we have the healthy mother plant,
but mother plant is often get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the plant gets sick and diseased,
then first of all, it interfered the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, or even your rooting is
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the rooted plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put in the production,
it has a significant impact on yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's a message to me saying
that conventional methods should work,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is needs a healthy plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the tissue culture comes in
saying that the tissue culture can,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can use the benefit of tissue culture
to clean the plan, make a healthy plan and
[SPEAKER_02]: offer to the new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really the biggest benefit of
tissue culture is the opportunity to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: clean, clean plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and this, and that's one of the
challenges with clonal propagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the most common form of
propagation right now with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it is so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a genetically identical plant to
your original plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you get the same with tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a genetically identical plant as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I think is important though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the word aseptic, which is another
word for sterile for those who are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this whole process with tissue culture
requires a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a real challenge for a lot of
labs and growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is, I think one of the reasons
we don't see tissue culture popping up as
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully, uh, in cannabis operations
as, uh, you may, you may think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the challenge with tissue culture,
as I understand it is you need sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need, um, you need the right media,
the growth media that you're putting the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant into, and then you need to properly
maintain and care for that plant in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to get through the tissue culture process
to where you have a stable plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can put back out into the, into your
growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to add exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the main goal, uh, for the
tissue culture can be providing healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This healthy plant is not only,
uh, can be pest free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can be pathogen free and also including a
virus and wire rate, which is now these
[SPEAKER_02]: days is hot topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've listened to one of your episode,
the previous episode regarding platen wire
[SPEAKER_02]: rate, which is a devastating pathogen for,
for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the cannabis, also with the,
with the tissue culture, we are able using
[SPEAKER_02]: Maristem culture techniques, uh,
get the plant, uh, healthy again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tech, this technique, uh,
I have read, I have done it for two rounds
[SPEAKER_02]: so far, and this is a regional rate
healthy plant, but takes up nine to 10
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a very quick and, uh,
an easy process, but it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other things also, I wanted to add it
with what you said is the conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we, I'm sure you have visited many
licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very proud of this strain they
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are sometimes they are 50 and
sometimes they are few hundreds of strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want it to lose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they consider it as an asset of the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of those different strain carries a
specific profile of terpenes, a specific,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also high potency or low potency or
different ratio of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want it to lose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to have them in a case.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to put them in for the
production, but this maintenance of mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plant of different strain in the form of
mother plants, it's very costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sometimes they occupied, mother plant
occupied up to 20 to 30% of the total,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cannabis also can offer also
conservation, meaning just that we need a
[SPEAKER_02]: few piece of stem of those mother plants,
put them through the sterilization using
[SPEAKER_02]: sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually is it just the 10 times dilution
of bleach works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we put in the medium and let them
just stay there and slightly grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have in the one square meter
of shelf, you can probably holding 30 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So enormously save costs for the license
holder instead of the having mother plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which also vulnerable for the disease and
pest, put them in the, in the in vitro
[SPEAKER_02]: condition, in the estriol condition and
keep them there to my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I again, back to your genetic fidelity
and, uh, to my experience, I kept a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: those experience up to three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we took them back and acclimate
them and we put them to the gross gross,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were the same as mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, there was a no gen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not receive any genetic drift over
three years to my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said 30, just to highlight,
you said 30 to 50 plants in one square
[SPEAKER_01]: meter of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially a shelf on a, on a,
on a rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you're, I remember seeing a photo
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You showed, uh, the, what light levels
were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of be a tissue culture in
general doesn't need high level of light
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a not much evaporation is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a not much transpiration is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore light of the hundred micro moles
per square meter per second is the usually
[SPEAKER_02]: is optimal, but also a species to a
species can be varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already tested for cannabis between a
hundred to a hundred 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an optimal arrange for cannabis,
micro propagation and tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saving a ton of electricity as
well over the course of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, essentially three years of
keeping those genetics preserved,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with minimal light, I mean,
that's a, that's a shop light,
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less what we would call here,
just an led, a cheap led bulb would give
[SPEAKER_01]: you getting back though, to your,
this idea that tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: meristematic tissue culture cleans plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to approach it from a different
angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were talking about a plant that's
been in production, a mother plant now
[SPEAKER_01]: you've had for years and, and,
um, well, I mean, you, uh, a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics you've had for years that maybe
your mother plant has changed every cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you seem to see some degradation in
the genetics, um, or at least the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you attribute this maybe to,
uh, a bacterial load or a viral load that
[SPEAKER_01]: may be building up in the mother plant to
where those genetics may still be the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic, uh, identical genetics to what
you had four years ago, but through the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of just plant stress and all these
other things, it's, it's less likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, I guess one question, is it less
likely to be genetic drift through clonal
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation than to be more of an issue of
pathogen load?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really, really nice
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, uh, many, uh, we have been interacted
with the many, uh, many growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they, many times they told me,
I'm sure probably you had the same
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they said we had this, this strain was
very nice and we had, we get the very good
[SPEAKER_02]: potency with the nice perfing,
terpene profile, but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the, the, the mother plant is
declining.
[SPEAKER_02]: The progeny we are taking from mother
plant, is not the same as before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely case to case might be
different, but most likely is just that
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the pathogen load decline in
the mother plant and also transmitted from
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant to the, to the progeny and
they will be a stay with the progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a main challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having, uh, tissue culture techniques
in place, we are able to clean up the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a multiple client saying that our
mother plant getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you send us few healthy plant
every six months, then we are guaranteed
[SPEAKER_02]: we are starting, our starting material is
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically again, what we are learning
here, we are probably in, at least in the
[SPEAKER_02]: case of cannabis, micro propagation is not
main goal of tissue culture, but cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: program, uh, would, uh, would be very nice
goal for tissue culture as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, so, so we may be able to use tissue
culture as a way of, um, getting plants
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshed to back to where they were,
you know, say years ago, uh, cause as a
[SPEAKER_01]: geneticist, I'm not a geneticist,
but from a genetic perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I understand, it, uh, stress plants are
more likely to experience genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, if you're constantly
cloning off of a plant that's stressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may get some genetic mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more incidents of genetic
mutation more likely to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, what seems to be
happening, uh, in most cases is like what
[SPEAKER_01]: you just suggested is this idea that there
is a pathogen load that's stressing the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so if we can remove that pathogen
load, we may be able to get back to their
[SPEAKER_01]: original genetics that, you know,
we originally had that we were so excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound like an okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is a, but most, I don't want to
rule out the possibility of genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: drifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's could naturally is happening in the
nature and including cannabis and at the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial scale, but I want to say most
likely this declining, we are observing
[SPEAKER_02]: very often in the, in the, in the
different mother plants and different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars they are putting for production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's comes from the different pathogen get
into them, those cannabis and cannabis are
[SPEAKER_02]: very vulnerable to many pathogen,
including also a virus and virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had a plant in a commercial
facility, let's say my facility was
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated with hop late environment and
we knew we had it in our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tested for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten positive results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so the process would be to send off
samples or small tissue, small amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue to a tissue culture lab,
a reputable tissue culture lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the plants that we get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume then a reputable tissue
culture lab would be able to grow those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the plants are established
at a certain size or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: robustness, then they'd be able to,
uh, test them for pop late and viroid or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever pathogen we're trying to remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, we could have a
COA essentially stating that the plant is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is viroid free that could come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into our facility and allow us to start
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what we used to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few clients approached us saying that
we're our, our, um, but the best elite
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar was contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we test is positive and we don't know
what to do and plant is declining.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we ask is just a few piece of
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we asked, we, we put them through
the sterilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them, uh, to the culture medium
and, and force the buds to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very, it's worth it to mention
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So meristem culture is, is just the
excision of the top growing top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it apical meristem of shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you excise this part and remove it and
place it in the medium, you regenerate a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant from the very tiny amount of
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's back because there is a reason
growing point is the place the cell
[SPEAKER_02]: division is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very active and usually virus and
viroid located in xylem and phloem,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the tip of the shoot has not developed
xylem and phloem and is actively growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growing point and the, the viroid
never reached to the point you are
[SPEAKER_02]: excising the tip and you are putting to
me, putting the medium to hoping for
[SPEAKER_02]: regeneration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also is, uh, I know I need to also
explain that usually we do some treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: depends off the type of the virus to
reduce the virus load and then take the,
[SPEAKER_02]: take the excise the tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And putting the medium after optimization
and bringing the new formulation for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, which was one of the papers we
discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, now we are able to do this meristem
culture because now formulation is ready
[SPEAKER_02]: to even regenerate, uh, whole plant from
very small, tiny amount of the apical
[SPEAKER_02]: dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about 0.2 to 0.5 millimeters
of the tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: He popped the shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes so much more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I had heard of, you know, meristem ag
tissue culture, but I didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the reasoning behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying because that shoot tip at
the very top of the plant, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's, I always use the Christmas tree
example, you know, the apical dominance,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant wants to grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want our plan to grow like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to create a canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we typically remove that, that apical
dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the lateral branching where it
occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think candelabra shape rather than,
um, uh, Christmas tree shape, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: use visual examples, branchy, branchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a more even canopy indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I wasn't aware of the,
so because the xylem and phloem have not
[SPEAKER_01]: fully formed in that meristematic tissue,
it's going to have a lower viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroid load already.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if we were topping our plants to,
you know, destroy that apical dominance,
[SPEAKER_01]: to create that canopy already,
can we still take the meristematic tips
[SPEAKER_01]: from other, uh, shoots on the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially the end branch of any of
our branches rather than just the very top
[SPEAKER_01]: most dominant apical location or apical
meristematic tissue on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes, that, uh, so basically every
single bud is capable of making new shoots
[SPEAKER_02]: in the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are, in fact, you are forcing even,
uh, dormant, uh, bud in the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: start to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's starting to grow is the very
good material for, for, uh, meristem
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically even I have just,
I have just as example, if I have a 20
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeter of branch, it's already have
five buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just take a piece of those stems,
including buds, put them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilization, put them in the medium
culture, force them to grow buds and break
[SPEAKER_02]: the dormancy and force them to,
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a, that's a starting material
for meristem culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the tip of the shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tip of the shoot of any point of
the branch will give you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, can we talk a little bit more about
hydro-hydricity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was a term that I was not
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen plants with hydro-hydricity
before, but I didn't know that term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this being a podcast,
I'll try to put some photos up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast page so folks can go and see what
we're talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how would you describe
hydro-hydricity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes, when we are taking a stems and
inserting on the very nutritious medium,
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium has plenty of water and,
and plant does not have a route to control
[SPEAKER_02]: the intake of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are taking up too much water because
they don't have an organ to control
[SPEAKER_02]: absorption of water or minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they take up too much,
we know in the plant tissue, there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: cells and also there is an intercellular
space, which usually is very humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's filled by air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the hyper-hydricity, this water
comes in and fill those intercellular
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a cause then that the plant
cannot take a breath and do the
[SPEAKER_02]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cause hyper-hydricity or also
known as a vitrification.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not only happening in cannabis,
in cannabis is very often because a
[SPEAKER_02]: formulation of medium was not optimized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did this part a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also it's happening in the other
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some species are more, more resilient
compared to others, but also is happening
[SPEAKER_02]: in the all species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I saw it, it reminded me a
little bit of when a plant re-veges in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that it, it looked like just a very
confused, hormonal stress response,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's just a bunch of like twisting
and yellowing, just a very unhappy
[SPEAKER_01]: looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even look like a plant at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very weird look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond the fact that it looks funny,
I assume the success rates of those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the quality of the plant go down as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The success rate remarkably goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you take a plant, hyper-hydricity
plant and take it to, and put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium in the pots and try to acclimate
them, the success rate is very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually in cannabis we get more than 95%
of healthy plant acclimated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take it, yeah, because it has
a root, it has a healthy leaves and they
[SPEAKER_02]: can quickly adapt themselves in the pot
and soil, but it comes from tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: to soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of hyper-hydricity plant,
they are very vulnerable for losing water
[SPEAKER_02]: and they usually get desiccated and the
rate is dropped remarkably, maybe to 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 20% in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very difficult, but the one is
surviving.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the new growth turns back,
turns make new leaves, new shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that are surviving, they're back
to the normal because this artificial
[SPEAKER_02]: impact of the inside the tissue culture
jar make this adverse reaction for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one is, you mentioned going from this
tissue culture media into actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does that occur in the process and is
there any special things that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do as you go from this media into a more
traditional growing media like soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: potting soil?
Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, like many other species also
need acclimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the tissue culture vessels,
they are in the closed environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity is almost close to the
100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore they don't make it too much
cuticle or wax in the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are more vulnerable to losing water
because they have been very in the fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never think about they had to produce
wax to protect their leaves and surface of
[SPEAKER_02]: the evaporation and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore when the complete plant,
including roots and shoots made in the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture, we can take them out from
the vessels and wash residue of the tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture medium because usually they are
very nutritious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have them and we can
wash it easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can plant them in the either
rock full plugs or Jiffy pot or even
[SPEAKER_02]: directly on the triple mix formulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only things in the first two weeks
needs humid condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually as a good practice,
those pots can go to the standard tray and
[SPEAKER_02]: covered by the transparent dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dome also has a some vent on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the beginning, the first few days
you don't open the vent, just let them
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimate themselves and gradually over
the days in two days, sorry, in two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: period, you can open the vent and get them
acclimated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually you can take off the dome and
they will be adapted to the ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we maintaining, I would assume with no
cuticle layer, we probably need to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the light levels similar to that,
what, 120 micromoles per second sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: range?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gradually increasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning, maybe first two,
three days would be the same level as a
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture level, the light density,
but you can increase it to 200 slowly,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe second week up to 300, where we are
using for the conventional cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 250 to 300 can go over a period of two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will this plant at that stage look like a
clonal propagation cutting or will it look
[SPEAKER_01]: different?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a look, it's a very similar,
the leaves is very similar, healthy leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: and the same as cuttings, but you don't
see the main stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the cuttings, you can see the main stem
of mother plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the roots comes out of main stem of
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is, you can see probably two or three
branches and they are much narrower and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't see any part of the tissue comes
from mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it by own, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the stems is tinier and doesn't have
the main body or main trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That clone that was cloned off of a stem
looks, is going to look more like a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional plant because the roots are
going to be coming right out of that stem,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't get that with a tissue
culture plant because there's no original
[SPEAKER_01]: stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, after a few weeks,
if you grow them together, the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: originated from cuttings versus the tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow them after a few weeks,
it's really hard to identify which one is
which.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of them, again, I just want to
emphasize both of them because they have
[SPEAKER_02]: taken from vegetative part of the plant,
they are, we call it true to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are identical to the mother plant and
that's why we can use it for commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting back to this hyper-hydricity,
that is purely an issue with the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are using in tissue culture,
which was one of your papers was looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewing what was currently being used
and talking about how to optimize that
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about that
in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, maybe now I can explain about this
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found the existing medium doesn't
work properly, at least not for at least
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 different strains we have used.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the main components of tissue
culture medium is minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minerals, more or less the same minerals
we are using for cannabis, but at the
[SPEAKER_02]: lesser concentration, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found this is not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put those, I take some statistic and
experimental method, design it to just see
[SPEAKER_02]: which minerals is high or which mineral is
low to optimize this balance and
[SPEAKER_02]: formulation for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: After several round of the adding and
reducing different group of minerals,
[SPEAKER_02]: we found that calcium, magnesium,
potassium are low in the existing MS
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by elevation dose, we were able to get
the better growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first step we have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was good founding the whole tissue,
we just compare it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have some pictures in the paper
showing that this is a control medium,
[SPEAKER_02]: existing medium, and this is an improved
medium, larger, better branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that, what your control
was in terms of what was this existing
[SPEAKER_01]: medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the general medium extensively
being used for many species, they call it
[SPEAKER_02]: moroshige and a scoop or by abbreviation,
MS medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: This MS medium was in the market and they
put the label, they are good for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was based on the previous
publication has been done years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out it doesn't because the
researchers just used one or two strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: so didn't apply for all the strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tested for the massive number of
the strain and we found that this is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably has not been, it is not optimized
medium for many, many strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to optimize medium to have a
versatile formulation for all the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: across the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second step, but we had a better
growth with the new formulation by
[SPEAKER_02]: elevating few elements, but we didn't
solve the hyper-hydricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still plant taking up too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, put them in the intercellular
space, water in this intercellular space,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have some malformality as you
described it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also, we went to the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the remedy for the
hyper-hydricity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried multiple chemicals and we
found silicate, potassium, the addition of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium silicate to the medium can
extensively control the incident of
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper-hydricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by addition of the silicate now,
we know also silicate is very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very helpful to grow cannabis and healthy
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a line of evidence showing that
even application of silicate also elevate
[SPEAKER_02]: the resistance cannabis against powdery
medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very recent finding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by adding, but this is for us is just
the control of the hyper-hydricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Addition of this potassium silicate
improve the, reduce the incident of
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper-hydricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big proponent for potassium
silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica in general with cannabis,
you see so many benefits later on in
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like if I'm understanding you
correctly, the big breakthrough was
[SPEAKER_01]: twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, you found that for the vast
majority of genetic diversity in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the control, the MS media was low in
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you might've said potassium as
well, specifically relative to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be for optimizing the tissue culture
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk about that in your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the addition of potassium
silicate really solved this
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper-hydricity issue that you were seeing
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was sort of a combination of those
two things that really improved the media
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the last challenge we had,
and again, now we saw we had a better
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, was very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had also controlled the
hyper-hydricity, was also big success.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rooting of the cannabis was the last
challenge we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes cannabis can stay there
growing, growing, and you get no roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And root processing did not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried many what would be the best
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that even, so because each step
we are using different hormones,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we found that even unlike was,
again, previous reports saying that use
[SPEAKER_02]: the rooting hormone like the IBA to root,
we found that rooting IBA and surprising
[SPEAKER_02]: is repressing rooting process in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unlike many different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by removing IBA, we will improve the
rooting process, just the no hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I mean, so you can imagine we
had a shoot with the leaves, with the
[SPEAKER_02]: stems, with almost three centimeters with
no roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider this as a cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what if I take this part and
putting the, again, in the astrile
[SPEAKER_02]: condition, putting the rock full club and
give them fertilizer, acting like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: a small cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the result was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In three weeks, we were able to get them
rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the picture is in the paper saying
that it's just that we just mimic what we
[SPEAKER_02]: are using in the commercial scale,
just a bit smaller section.
[SPEAKER_02]: A smaller size, almost one inch to one and
a half inch shoot with no root.
[SPEAKER_02]: We inserted to the plugs and we water them
with the astrile fertilizer and we kept
[SPEAKER_02]: them in the new vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rooted and directly this can go to
the larger part for the commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this rooting issue specific to
certain genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it, was it an issue across the board
with all the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the cultivar did not root in the
medium-contained rooting organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, they last, we have to
keep them more than four months to a small
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my understanding, because IBA over four
months get degraded.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they rooted because IBA was
degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting, because when I think of
clonal propagation, IBA is typically a
[SPEAKER_01]: very common root hormone that's used and
it's very effective in rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in tissue culture, you're saying it's
the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had, let's just say we had a
hundred different genetic cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: what percent of those using this updated
medium-contained media that you formulated
[SPEAKER_01]: and with the potassium silicate,
what percent of those would still
[SPEAKER_01]: experience hydro-hydrocity or have issues
with rooting if you've removed the rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: hormone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you still need to do that extra step
with the rockwool or to get roots or what
[SPEAKER_01]: are your experiences with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the new formulation, followed by the
rooting on the rockwool in the astrile
[SPEAKER_02]: condition, I would say the majority of
them might be over the 90 to 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will successfully get the rooted and
those rooted would be acclimated
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully for the commercial use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done at least more than 100
different strains in this new formulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them grow better than others,
but we did not have any loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, yeah, we didn't have any
loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a really versatile,
I can say it's a versatile formulation for
[SPEAKER_02]: the all cultivars for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see any hyper-hydrocity in the new
formulation with certain genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small portion of them in some
strains still showing some
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper-hydrocity, but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if you make it 100,
some cultivars may be showing 10 to 15% of
[SPEAKER_02]: them hyper-hydrocity, but 85% they are
growing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in other cultivars, even you
don't see, barely you see any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this variability of hyper-hydrocity is
still happening, but they are now in the
[SPEAKER_02]: much smaller portion compared to the
previous formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on your research, your
recommendation would be to use this
[SPEAKER_01]: updated formulation that you've come up
with along with the potassium silicate,
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher levels of cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at a certain stage, taking those
shoots that you've created and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them into a Rockwell cube, and then giving
them a low level of fertilizer to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting productivity before reaching that
final, I guess, plant that is able to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back out into the commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's our finding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found this is the best way so far,
but this is a science, there's a no end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in the future, different group
finding even better or more simpler
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, I believe this is a very good
approach for the commercial scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: make a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, because now we have this formulation,
now we can do mainstream culture to get
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can preserve plant material in the
very small footprint of the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can also get some systemic pathogen
like a Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very common in Canada and we can use
the growing point and take them out and
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerate the new plant and get rid of
the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those downstream application now is
possible because the foundation is already
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you brought up a really good
point about science is what you've created
[SPEAKER_01]: is now a replicable formulation that
anyone in theory, any other scientist or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone in the world could recreate these
conditions and show the same level of
[SPEAKER_01]: success and maybe down the road,
someone will discover a better process and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully share that with the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's great about
collaboration in science versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, keeping this knowledge within your
company and not allowing anyone else to
[SPEAKER_01]: really utilize this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely slows down the process of
our industry in improving and learning
[SPEAKER_01]: collectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You again mentioned a very nice point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two options to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it public information and share this
experience with the new industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is quite thirsty for the knowledge
of cannabis and tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: or make it patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was moving toward to the first option
and I convinced everyone to just make it
[SPEAKER_02]: public information for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things I'm very proud
and happy is just make it this one public
[SPEAKER_02]: information because not many is available
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's very important and
probably less profitable, but I think very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have a couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions that I had is,
how expensive would it be for a facility
[SPEAKER_01]: to either, and these are going to be
approximate because every situation or
[SPEAKER_01]: every company is going to be different,
but what should a company expect to pay to
[SPEAKER_01]: get genetics cleaned through a third party
lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on top of that, what would it cost
approximately for a larger cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: facility to set up their own lab and
tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I prefer to answer your first
question saying that how long it takes to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide lab services.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were talking about the Maristem
culture, I said it takes nine to 10
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the other services like
elimination of the systemic pathogen or
[SPEAKER_02]: clean up, get rid of the old pattern,
will do any pest or eggs of the pest from
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very quick and it takes about
three to four months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very, very quick and short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only Maristem culture takes longer because
really you start with the very small
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the cost of a lab, it varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies from country to country and
depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the license holder are interested
to have a lab as a part or a small
[SPEAKER_02]: department within a whole company,
this can be done, I believe, between half
[SPEAKER_02]: a million to one million by just and also
depends on the sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually need three different
compartments, one for incubation,
[SPEAKER_02]: one for operation and one as a kitchen of
the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's a part of my job in the
past to design those parts and put all
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not expensive as they think.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are saying that lab is very
expensive, very costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth it to have a healthy starting
material for production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could absolutely see where a
large scale facility could benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: having something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like a large number to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking US dollars here or Canadian
or Australian dollars?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe US is the best estimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that number is in US dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, just to get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really limits the number of
facilities that can do this in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assuming we were to send genetics to a
third party, would we be looking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: range of hundreds of dollars per genetic
plant or thousands, tens of thousands?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be an expected approximate
cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize this is going to be a very,
very rough number and no one should hold
[SPEAKER_01]: us to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to give listeners a kind of rough
idea of what something like this might
[SPEAKER_01]: cost to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much does it cost for the
lab because, again, labor in different
[SPEAKER_02]: countries is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can just provide some range,
some lab that providing those services,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, conservation per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make a contract, annual
contract saying that I'm sending you 10
[SPEAKER_02]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep it for me and you send it back to
me whenever I need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably cost between maybe
three to six thousand per strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, three thousand to six thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends, again, with the country and
currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning also could be slightly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that conservation doesn't
necessarily include a cleaning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: removal of viroids or pathogens or pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Viroids, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, viroids, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't go through the meristem
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but they can get rid of the systemic
pathogen like a fusarium or surface
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen like a powdery beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the cleaning process,
like if you had to do a meristematic
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture to remove, let's just stay
with hoplite and viroid because it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the bigger issues right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what do you estimate that
much?
[SPEAKER_01]: What might cost for that eight month,
nine month process?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that for to be honest,
but again, that could be a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands to to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as and also there is some cost is
involved for the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need you need, as you mentioned
it, you need a C or A to to show your
[SPEAKER_02]: client that that the pathogen no longer
exists in this particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can send it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, again, maybe maybe four to seven
thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a that's again could be estimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's worth it if you get the really
clean product back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a key genetic that's tied to your
marketing and branding and that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: yielder and important for your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively speaking, that's not a large
amount of money on that scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does bring up, I think, probably my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have two more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question that I would love to hear
your thoughts on is how do I evaluate a
[SPEAKER_01]: third party lab that offers tissue culture
services?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the questions you would ask or
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess how do you evaluate them in
general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's really hard as someone like
myself who's not a scientist or researcher
[SPEAKER_01]: to know that my money is being spent with
a lab that's going to be able to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: the results that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think in this stage, we should
stick to the facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can you can ask for the end product
and see the quality of the end product,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you see, what you are receiving as a
client.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask them what what they are
making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, is it really normal and plant
are healthy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, if you are looking to eliminate
any specific pathogens, as we mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, you have to ask for certificate
of analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe this is also will be another
through the accredited lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ask them to send a sample and get the
certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you peace of mind that the planned
tissue culture plan no longer can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It carry any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is then would be very exciting moment
for you to bring the healthy product and
[SPEAKER_02]: put them in a production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting a certificate of analysis from
a different lab than the one that did the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture would be a way of getting a
better verification as to the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: of what you're getting from the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that that's good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, last question that I had was for
someone who's passionate about organic
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, are there any options that
are organic within the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: world or micro propagation or is it really
limited to these mineral salt
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, to my knowledge, would be very
tricky to have organic matter in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium because plants are very vulnerable
in this close environment and any any
[SPEAKER_02]: byproduct can stop them to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all all the ingredients which contain
vitamins, contain carbohydrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: contain also minerals, as we discussed,
has to be fine tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do not recommend to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot imagine the organic material one
day to be in the in the aseptic
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, in the in vitro condition,
being astride and providing good
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for the plant for tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of the plant needing nutrients in
an ionic form that they can take up,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is challenging in organic
production, because that that process is
[SPEAKER_01]: typically occurs, the nutrient cycling
through microbial interactions with carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: based fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need a sterile environment where
that sort of interaction cannot occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really are forced to use synthetic
or mineral salt chemicals in this in this
[SPEAKER_01]: regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for answering that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that was the last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized I missed one on my
list of questions, which was an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: paper that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just touch here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've taken a lot of time briefly
on what is synthetic seed, because I had
[SPEAKER_01]: never heard that term before seeing seeing
it used in your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you can you touch on that really,
really quickly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know the natural seeds and we know
also by natural seed is the result of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination, fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the case of cannabis, we have a
male plant, we have a female and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds is a result of the fertilization of
the two different individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is more also important to know the
seedlings, which is a plant comes from the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not identical, neither to mother
or nor father plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are they are might be similar to some
extent, but they are not identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike cuttings, or tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we are we have done in the one year
of as a one year of research, where if you
[SPEAKER_02]: take a one piece of tissue from in burial
or even in the cannabis, we use again a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of stems with the pot we encapsulate
with the nutritious matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually we use sodium alginate in the
estrile condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we are making seed coat for the
piece of stem with one pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is we call it artificial seeds or we
call it synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good tools if you want to
import plant or conserve plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine you can have from one mother
plant, even a small size, you can every
[SPEAKER_02]: single node is a potential to be one seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can encapsulate them and keep it in
the estrile vessels or even Ziploc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our research shows that up to six
months, you can keep them in the 10 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: centigrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you take them out and putting the
medium, they will regenerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very good tool for export and
import.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to send from point A to
point B from different provinces or even
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries, you can make it
encapsulated of those those seeds from the
[SPEAKER_02]: stems and put them in the right vessels
and transfer them even room temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: from from one country to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they receive to the destination,
they can put them back to the to the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium and let them generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of they can get if you send
thousand, probably they in the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: by this 10 percent lose loss, they get 900
900 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking about this process, I would
assume that you would want to do this with
[SPEAKER_01]: a tissue culture plant first to remove any
pathogens or viruses or fibroids to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you're starting with very clean
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then create that's seeds that you
could ship all around the world or store
[SPEAKER_01]: for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best scenario, you grow them in a
tissue culture, you provide enough
[SPEAKER_02]: material, you send a piece of those
material to to get the COA, either from
[SPEAKER_02]: from the viral aid, from Fusarium,
Fumerticillium and so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mother plant is healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can encapsulate them and you send
it to the anywhere in the world with the
[SPEAKER_02]: all certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the quarantine will be much more should
be much easier because because this this
[SPEAKER_02]: is already mother plant in the aseptic
condition grown and did not carry any
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today and sharing your research and
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing this this wonderful knowledge with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned I learned a bunch of stuff even
just during this conversation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for providing this
opportunity for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get in contact with your audience.
Thank you very much.
