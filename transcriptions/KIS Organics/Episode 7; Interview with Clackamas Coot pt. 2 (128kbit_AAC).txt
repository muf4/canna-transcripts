[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everyone for a successful
launch of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate all the feedback and
comments I've gotten so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're enjoying these, please take a
moment to subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever platform you're listening on
and leave me a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really helpful and allows me to
keep producing good content by drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the top names in the industry to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part two of our series with Jim
Bennett, also known as Clackamas Coot on
[SPEAKER_00]: such forums as IC Mag and Lumber Dogs on
Grass City.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an organic grower and gardener who
has helped many people in improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they garden and move away from bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pick up pretty much where we left off
last time with him and without further
[SPEAKER_00]: ado, let's dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talked about the neem earlier
that you're adding into your worm bin and
[SPEAKER_00]: into your soils, you and I have talked
many times about how there's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the quality of neem
depending on where it's coming from or the
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of acidiractin can vary quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, neem is not a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gentleman from Monsoon Farms
Direct, he's provided me the pictures and
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole of being collected, you know,
accumulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they go into processing plants
where the oil is pressed because in
[SPEAKER_02]: Ayurvedic preparation, as an example,
over 70% have some form of neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all parts of the neem tree are used,
the roots, the bark, the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course, the kernels, which the husk
or the hull, I guess you'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here, this is the best example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of a neem tree as an olive tree
because they're both groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, there's a lot of similarities
in the shape of the leaves and the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do with olives is that they're
taken and processed and we eat that husk,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you couldn't do that with neem
because it's really bitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fed to livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to some degree, in some districts,
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the kernel, the seed,
that that's what's pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what's left is the rest of the
world calls it cake for reasons that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: make a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in the United States,
we call everything meals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything that's a meal with exception
to alfalfa is pressed like flax,
[SPEAKER_02]: flax seed meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's flax seeds has had the oil removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously those are going to have
traces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's back to how are they grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: The different districts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can buy really poor quality neem
meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure what the advantage is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to say, so you can go online and bad
mouth neem?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just think it's important that
listeners are aware that if they go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: neem from one brand, it may not be the
same quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: From another brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's an important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know me long enough that I'm
really loyal.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I find something that works,
I'll test something for somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it takes a lot for me to move from
this to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been buying from the same person
for 10 years, the neem, because it has
[SPEAKER_02]: performed well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And others in my circle of friends and
online folks that have shared their
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences, they've had good experiences,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you that the first thing
and I'm not going to name names,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the first name I bought was from
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was absolutely as soon as I opened
the bag, I thought, who would use this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was adulterated with wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, you know, bad compost
or soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it was from an ad in Acres
USA magazine, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: publications, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a half page ad there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, OK, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got a gallon of Karanja and a
gallon of neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they included five pounds of each
meal, five pounds of neem and five pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of Karanja.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to add one other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, Vic, Victor from Monsoon Farms shared
a, and I'll send it to you, white sheet on
[SPEAKER_02]: combining the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found in this study out of India
that 70 percent neem and 30 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: Karanja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't use metric in this country,
but if we did, it'd be easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just call it 66 and 33.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two teaspoons of neem emulsified and
one teaspoon of Karanja that makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: tablespoon, which is our normal apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is an elevated level of
effective actions on both insects as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as disease suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've been using soap nuts for its
saponin content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soap nuts have 250,000 ppm of saponin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use that in your water, your foliar
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the two parts neem, one part Karanja,
and then you can use the soap nut juice or
[SPEAKER_02]: tea, I guess we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're dancing, especially because
it'll come out like foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, those horrible Christmas
trees, the pink and the blue ones they
[SPEAKER_02]: sell at the Christmas tree lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been sprayed with some kind of
foam to make it look like a postcard or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how much you're coating
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to stick on those leaves,
especially if you do it correctly and do
[SPEAKER_02]: it right before sundown or lights out for
several hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get lazy and think because after
the second time you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, God, I killed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you still got to do the four
applications every 72 hours apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to break completely that egg
larva, adult larva, you know, egg larva
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes, according to the experts,
four applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of people just aren't going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want something that, you know,
one time and hey, and I slightly disagree
[SPEAKER_02]: with you in regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, as a direct in is a very important,
obviously, but it's also the easiest one
[SPEAKER_02]: to extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why you see so many as a direct
in materials as a direct and only
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much more that goes on in
neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have prevents the insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have my list in front of me,
but we've talked about serin and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the others that prevent the insect causes
them to vomit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can't eat or keep down the food,
prevents the females from laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's there's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like saying if say that you got
sick and the doctor told you, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need you need to eat oranges because
that vitamin C is really going to push you
[SPEAKER_02]: towards health.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that doesn't mean you can go over to
Wal-Mart and get a bottle of vitamin C
[SPEAKER_02]: tablets and accomplish the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, remember, it's not about
carotene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the carrot because there's so
much more going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of this pinpoint
application of things, both in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers, for lack of a better word,
or these pesticides and fungicides,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just focus on one thing and know
there's it's this, not that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I don't disagree with you at
all on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think you're the one that sent
me the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called what's in a neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will track it down and I'll post the
link to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it talks about nimbin and some of
these other metabolites that are also have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of either plant benefit or insect
suppression property.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said this for years that if let's say
that, I don't know, it wouldn't happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but neem had all of the pesticide and
fungicide compounds removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them are triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still use neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause remember the ones that we're focused
on in the gardening sector total about 22,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's 368 active compounds that have
been identified, but only 110 have been
[SPEAKER_02]: cataloged and researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just scratching the surface where
remember the neem tree can be found in
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian art going back 11,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word in Tamil language literally means
village pharmacy and everywhere that the
[SPEAKER_02]: neem tree went as it was spread by the
spice root and the silk road, India moved
[SPEAKER_02]: plants all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how India ended up with a plant
from Africa that we today call aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the neem came out of Burma and
it's a very close relative of mahogany
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this plant has medicinal values.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is a birth control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Livestock and humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does the same thing with insects,
prevents reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not only do you get rid of them,
but see, it's not a poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, I wouldn't suggest it because it's so
horrible tasting, but you could literally
[SPEAKER_02]: drink neem and not have any medical issues
other than vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try the neem toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was not, not delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, when I go to the Indian store,
I always go to the, uh, Habba,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the health and beauty aids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking creams, lotions,
toothpaste, uh, soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use a soap that I get that's a neem
and olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't smell like light boy
with how many perfuming agents,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm talking about commercial bar
soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's definitely reminds you
of being in India, but I remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I went to India the first time in 73
and watching sadhus chewing on neem
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gandhi at his ashram, the story is told in
the book, autobiography of a yogi,
[SPEAKER_02]: Paramahansa Yogananda went back to India
in the early thirties and he visited a
[SPEAKER_02]: Gandhi and every morning Gandhi would eat
or chew on neem leaves because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: bitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a spiritual act to remind us
that life is a balance of a sweet and
[SPEAKER_02]: bitter, but yeah, it's not poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the stuff that I read online,
Oh, you know, that stuff will get right
[SPEAKER_01]: into your plant and really affect the
taste of your, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just horse pucky,
you know, I mean, just silliness using,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what I'd like to call stoner science,
trying to discuss something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with neem is that not only are
you getting a pesticide, incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicide, I'm going to mispronounce this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, but anyway, it would be the I'd that
takes care of nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like it does with fungi,
it decreases the pathogenic versions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that causes problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But enhance the development of the other,
the good fungal colonies that we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one, a white sheet from
Pakistan that shows the enhanced
[SPEAKER_02]: development of microhyzal fungal colonies
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this, this is not rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is not the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think of nitrogen fixing plants,
most of us are going to think of clovers
[SPEAKER_02]: and legumes and those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what also fixes nitrogen in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in essence, that shows why neem has
been able to be grown in such a wide range
[SPEAKER_02]: of climates and soil, poor soils,
because it can take oxygen, nitrogen out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the air and fix it into its root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of, that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every country almost that the neem
tree went to, it became a holy plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Middle East, China, and even up into
Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: In certain parts they grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, India spread this thing everywhere
because 5,000 years ago it was viewed as
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the strongest of the medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had, for example, my dog got her
paw hurt, a thorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't going to go spend a hundred
dollars to have the vet pull a thorn out
[SPEAKER_02]: of her paw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took straight neem oil and dabbed
it on after I got the thorn out of her paw
[SPEAKER_02]: and dabbed it on her injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you that it was as good as
anything I would have been bought,
[SPEAKER_02]: sold probably for 50, $60, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the vet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they don't give us these pet
applications free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say we use the neem shampoo
to treat feather mites on our chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and try adding it to just,
you know, all you got to do to add
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously is just set up a 20 gallon pot
as a worm bin and throw in a couple cups
[SPEAKER_02]: of neem meal and see for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did set up some giant 200 gallon
ones back when Bill was working with us
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was doing that and he put in the
basalt and the neem, all a kelp,
[SPEAKER_00]: all per your recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was pre-barley days.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those worm, those worm bits did
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of the castings that came out
of it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a year later when we harvested,
I know people were concerned about was
[SPEAKER_00]: that the neem would be inhibiting for
beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent you that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freely available to watch on YouTube
of the microscope work I did that found
[SPEAKER_00]: that the, the neem cake actually
increased.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased the beneficial bacteria and
fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a lot of, as you know,
in discussing other topics, I have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of respect for the history of India in
many regards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those would be agriculture and
their science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a culture that if you want
to call it discovered zero, that was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty important, you know, a few thousand
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant in India is used in the soil,
not so much the spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of an American thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the meal in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're, they've been about feeding
the soil for thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, which is one of the reasons that
their fields are still viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that haven't been adulterated with
Monsanto or union carbide silliness,
[SPEAKER_02]: not silliness, murderous ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you said something earlier and I
just want to come back to it about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spend a lot of time and maybe money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I look at products at the growth
store that cost $90 for a cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who's spending the money here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I buy a bag of kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I get a good deal, but let's say
I was even paying full bore, $1.50 a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can see why it's not promoted at
growth stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they want to say something that
good when the most they're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: out of is what, maybe 50 cents a pound
profit?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know the drill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you put it in a cute box
with a neat thing on it and call it
[SPEAKER_02]: something else, you know, they'll line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is really important that
growers look at ingredient labels and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's actually in a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally agree with you regarding
things that are proprietary because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important for me as a gardener,
whether I'm growing a tomato or cams
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, whatever, whatever it is,
if it's going to go in my body,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what's going into my soil
and what's going into my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing you wanted to,
you and I were talking in the past several
[SPEAKER_02]: times and online, the sphagnum peat moss
versus peat moss discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sphagnum peat moss is controlled by the
Canadian sphagnum peat moss association.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can visit their website so you can
verify all this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a group that's made up of the
harvesters in conjunction with,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's a combination of private industry
and federal or they don't call it federal
[SPEAKER_02]: up there, but national government,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the harvest is set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if company A sees their
orders go through the roof, they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: just go and harvest more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the downside for the
harvesters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only about eight or nine companies
that are allowed to harvest sphagnum peat
[SPEAKER_02]: moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one company, Sungrow, which products
that the audience would know, let's see,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Sunshine Mixes, Sunshine Mix number
one, number four of those, but then the
[SPEAKER_02]: retail product, Black Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bigger than all, that's Sungrow
Horticulture, is bigger than all their
[SPEAKER_02]: competitors combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sungrow Harvest last year was 54% of the
total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you and I used the 3.8 cubic feet,
which is actually more, because what would
[SPEAKER_02]: you say when you bust it up to a stage
that it's ready to mix soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many cubic feet do you think you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say five, but I was curious what,
because I know you had a professional from
[SPEAKER_02]: the 30s, a professional mixing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would usually say six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, six.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, when we buy those, and I want
to share this too, if you don't have a big
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery supply in your area, go to Ace
Hardware, because there's probably going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be an Ace Hardware store and you buy it
online and it's called Ship This Store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't pay any handling fees or
shipping costs and you go pick it up at
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever you designate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a way of getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you and I, we live in the Northwest
and there's bales everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when those are harvested, those are cut
when it's frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it easy to cut, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're wrapped and shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff that goes into soil mixes
and including theirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they call sterilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sterilize those bales, or excuse me,
the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a kiln, a conveyor belt that runs
through a kiln.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right there, you've killed the
microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now when it comes to the packing shed,
the big ones, it's chopped to a consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: size because it's going to look nicer in
the bag, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's injected with steam because
you've got to rehydrate this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've run it through an oven and
we've injected it with steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to talk about microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be clear, you're referring to
sunshine mix, not the 3.8 cubic foot bale
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm saying the bales are cut out of
the ground, wrapped, and shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as untouched as you can get at our
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the mixes, I mean, by the time you get
down to the potting soil companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know, but I'm sure it's got
to be over 2,000 Home Depot stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, probably,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's adding lows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now think about how many bags of soil each
one of those stores are going to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different names, Miracle Grow,
you know, all the different names out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, none of those mix their own soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all subcontracted to the big players
like Sungrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the soil is mixed, it's an auger
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think yours is the old style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the claws, the antique soil mixture
you had at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying it's better,
but that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new ones are a big auger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes eight minutes to mix an
entire truckload of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that for a minute,
eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it shifts and moves over into
another machine where it's bagged and then
[SPEAKER_02]: stacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think of all the Home Depots there are
and how many bags of soil, how many
[SPEAKER_02]: truckloads?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're going to get about a thousand
on a truck for sake of this discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have material that's in transit
going from the manufacturer to their
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have trucks that are moving
it from the distribution center out to
[SPEAKER_02]: their stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I'm saying is there's a lot of potting
soil and there's a lot of garbage because
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say that you're Home Depot and
customer, happily married couple come in
[SPEAKER_02]: and they go, look, you killed our,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to argue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a new plant having a good life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're lost leaders, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole potting soil thing is a lost
leader because they're going to sell you
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've got it all set up,
how they're going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all of these amendments and juices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I'm just talking mainstream
nursery that we haven't talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: growth story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't name any names, but there's some
soils there that were one time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're a complete idiot if you
didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come to find out the parent company
is a lily grower in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people started seeing roots in
their potting soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, I wonder how that got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recycled soils, all kinds of games that
are played.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the big one is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using this is my favorite term.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you're the one I didn't know was
that cheap, but composted forest
[SPEAKER_02]: materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I live in the, one of the biggest
areas of North America where timber is
[SPEAKER_02]: converted to lumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got a lot of material left,
you know, you got the bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of the trunk on the trunk of the tree,
you got branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they extract cellulose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you go buy a loaf of fiber added.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the timber industry and those
cute little rapid router plugs.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever you want to call them in
different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made in a single factory down in
Springfield outside of Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the lowest quality material
you could possibly imagine because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: so many other markets that they
manufacture those from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to potting soil,
they sell this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I've noticed,
like when I go into Costco, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I see that bag of Scott's potting soil
for, you know, two cubic feet for like
[SPEAKER_00]: eight dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who mixes soil and knowing
the cost of ingredients and then going and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking on the label and seeing something
that says, you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: aged bark finds or forest humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the word humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, oh my gosh, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's all just marketing code
for essentially what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: with sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with bark, we have to be
especially careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to butcher this word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's alio pathic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the natural properties of bark are
designed in trees to help inhibit right
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we put bark down in our yards
to keep weeds from sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not something we want in our in
our potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right to me, those are red flags and
potting soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did get into a discussion recently
on Facebook because I posted this meme
[SPEAKER_00]: that I made with some of these terms just
to help educate growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got jumped on a little bit for using
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spagnum peat moss that was not sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was told, you know, leaf mold
compost is a good alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't get me wrong, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people mentioned hemp topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, none of these are consistent
commercially available, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: viable options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, they're I mean, topsoil to me
is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see the word topsoil, I won't even
put that on my ornamental plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's code for anything in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just think about this for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this country, the word I'm talking food
manufacturing, I'm going to start off with
[SPEAKER_02]: food manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The term natural means nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has no statutory, regulatory meaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine what it means in the world of pet
foods and potting and gardening materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't mean anything in our food,
imagine how little it means in those
[SPEAKER_02]: sectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the word natural, it's whatever you
want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one I like is that it shows you
the power of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miracle Grow has a new bag label.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks real hip, you know, it's got all
the cool graphics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says on there, made from organic
and natural materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of things can be organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had laws like other countries,
a lot of things in this country would be
[SPEAKER_02]: renamed or reclassified as wild harvested,
which is at least more accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but be that as it may, organic and
natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, that means nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like saying, well,
no, our drink is nutritious.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say that even if you live in a
rural area, find somebody that's raising
[SPEAKER_02]: worms for fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I first met Doug at
Northwest Redworms, he didn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there for, he was going to,
his business model was to sell worms and
[SPEAKER_02]: worm bins, and he makes some beautiful
worm bins.
[SPEAKER_02]: No question about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of needling one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, why don't you make some
vermicompost?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, well, is there any money in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Hey dude, these, the serious
organic terrorists, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way I call the market gardeners,
farmers, the ones that sell at your local
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers market, that size, not necessarily
home gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, it's all about quality and flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within a couple of years, he had guys
coming up from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rented U-Haul trucks to buy everything
he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year, he told me he sold 500
yards of top-notch vermicompost and 3000
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He still does the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, that money's, how would you
like to have workers that never call in
[SPEAKER_02]: sick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their moms don't get hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they just, all they do is lay
around and eat and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a pretty good workforce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big thing, back of worm bins,
water is your enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydration level was the term I was
grasping for earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your hydration level is too much and a
lot, usually that comes from using reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: that escape me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rubber maids with holes drilled in it and
trying to do kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're not going to get great
vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should recycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, if you don't recycle,
you should be I don't know, wear some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a hat that shows everybody you're a
clown.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not how you do vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's either going to be compost,
thermofilic compost, or you got to use
[SPEAKER_02]: quality manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not hung up on the manure thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I want to buy organic
dairy manure versus steer manure from
[SPEAKER_02]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But animals that are well taken care of,
like dairy herds and people like my
[SPEAKER_02]: chiropractor and his draft horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: He feeds them, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The salt, kelp, all the things that we put
in our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's far more kelp that goes into
livestock and goes into soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a person in the trade tell me that,
hey, if all you organic people quit using
[SPEAKER_02]: kelp meal in their soil, it wouldn't even
affect the bottom line enough to get
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned at the next board meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority goes into biomedical
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually beer too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes from the Irish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some stage, they use the kelp meal
to clarify the beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not cloudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some beers you want cloudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're a true minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: But show dogs, race horses, or chickens,
feed kelp meal to your chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It elevates the nutritional value of the
eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a perfect food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some of the most healthy cultures
around the world eat a lot of seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to one of these holistic pet
centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the same kelp that you and I use,
except they had milled it down to a powder
[SPEAKER_02]: so they could put it in caps for dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we pay, let's say full bore,
$1.50 a pound for kelp meal in a full bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just talking about buying one bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people retail on these kelp meal
tablets or capsules, $36 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can go over to Walmart and get
a brand new Mr. Coffee bean grinder and
[SPEAKER_02]: grind kelp as fine as I want, right,
for what, $10?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sprinkle a teaspoon every morning and
evening when I feed my bulldog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really important for puppies
because it's a really powerful very dense,
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritionally dense food that all of us
would benefit from eating ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we sell kelp for around
$100, $99 a 50 pound bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not terribly expensive as an
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use it with our chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter cup per 20 pounds, we add that
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As another way to help supplement their
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't thank you enough for the book
you recommended me eight, nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years ago, Dr. Sen's book.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the typography is horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I did better in my first Tandy
computer, you know, almost 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the information is, it's compelling to
finish the book because there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're talking about a man who spent
55 years studying kelp and more
[SPEAKER_02]: importantly, not just in agriculture,
but for most of your listeners,
[SPEAKER_02]: in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's still a professor emeritus
at Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got to be close to 100 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: T.L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got a big, huge park on the
university grounds named his his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use your library, the one that you
belong to locally and you can access the
[SPEAKER_02]: school library.
[SPEAKER_02]: The repository of documents from his 50
years of research is pretty tremendous and
[SPEAKER_02]: very enlightening because as it relates to
plant health, animal health and human
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll I'll put something in there for
listeners so they can see they can they
[SPEAKER_00]: can see a link to that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one I was trying to
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best price is Acres USA at one
time, Amazon, because it's a private
[SPEAKER_02]: published book, Amazon was selling the
book for 70 dollars and Acres USA had it
[SPEAKER_02]: and still do for 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plus you're helping out the oldest
sustainable agriculture magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do cover organic methods,
but their main focus is sustainable no
[SPEAKER_02]: till pasture development for those raising
grass fed beef and pork and what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other term that gets really
abused, free range chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free range chickens is right up there with
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other seaweed book I just want to
mention and I'll put a link to it as well
[SPEAKER_00]: is Food Power from the Sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the one I sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was the excellent read and
amazingly insightful for how old it was.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the human race has been dragging
kelp out of the ocean in certain regions,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the British Isles, I mean,
when you live on an island, your resources
[SPEAKER_02]: are very limited, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so and the Irish have always been not
as well, not okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the modern era, going back,
let's say to at least the 17th century,
[SPEAKER_02]: England's dominated the British Isles
financially and politically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people in Ireland had to make do with
things that maybe the people in London
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so incorporating seaweed into a number
of areas of their existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming, livestock feed, what have you,
was extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily recommend it because
it's by William Stafford, the man who
[SPEAKER_02]: founded MaxiCraft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that because there's only one
chapter that would be of interest to most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the gardening community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately, and I'll send it to you,
that chapter has been, with their
[SPEAKER_02]: permission, republished and it's available
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, but I don't, there was a treaty
signed in 58 or 59 and it's been renewed
[SPEAKER_02]: three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lays out definitely what can be
called kelp and what has to be called
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: My objection to seaweed extract is that
it's like buying a car, but you only get
[SPEAKER_02]: the frame and the motor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a body because everything
that all these wonderful attributes that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been discussing and the vitamins and
the plant hormones, they're gone in
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, does that mean that seaweed extracts
aren't beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't mean that it's as a
extremely balanced fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ease of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it with water and you apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty straightforward,
but I wouldn't use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In lieu of adding kelp meal to my soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that should be the focus that
you get the kelp meal in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you feel you need a, some kind of
a fertilizer supplement, then look to the
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you carry the good stuff from
Acadian seed plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, you're seeing some stuff on
eBay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you really got, I smelled some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how Acadian, when you smell it,
it smells like the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you took a walk on the beach.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smelled some stuff that people
bought from eBay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's just really good stuff from
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even smell like kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you, you'll find that person
online saying, oh yeah, kelp meal really
[SPEAKER_02]: screwed up my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been using kelp, what eight,
10 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever messed up a plant with kelp?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I want to comment on that
though, is in terms of the, the kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see you adding kelp meal directly to
your soil is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about the seaweed extract
powder, I've just started using more of it
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily because I'm finding that one,
it's a hundred percent soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can, for growers that are using other
bottled nutrients, this is a, it's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a way to transition them off of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seaweed extract powder that we carry
is actually nature's essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same thing as the Acadian,
but what you're looking for there is cold
[SPEAKER_00]: water processed, Asco phylum, Nidosum,
that North Atlantic sea kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maxi crop, unfortunately, as I
understand it is a chemical extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still use, I don't know if it's
sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to Omri, which I don't support
at all, but if you look up seaweed
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, they have a USDNOP site as in
C-I-T-E not S-I-T-E that seaweed extracts
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be made with either sodium or
potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's my read on that, which is why I
would never use it in a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: As good as Acadian is, and I believe that
their track record, they're a stellar
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inconceivable to me that every grain
of seaweed extract that's produced is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely free of traces of these very
alkaline materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the stuff they put in Drano
to clean your, it's also been used
[SPEAKER_02]: historically to cremate bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really sure that I want to add
that to the compost tea where the goal is
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow out, increase the microbial
colonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding of that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would I want to risk using a
material that might be tainted?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I use kelp, I know it's not going to
be tainted, but here's the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we use meals like kelp and others,
we're only, and use it to make a tea for
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only using up 45 to 50% of the
goodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's where your worm bin comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw the muck, so you're not losing
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're getting two good uses out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making this wonderful tea,
like you said, a transitional method to go
[SPEAKER_02]: from being a bottle oriented.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have the convenience of this
liquid and you have some muck,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want to call it, that you put
in your worm bin and get the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: goodies out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it seems like a win-win deal all
the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're suggesting, just to be
clear, is that listeners would take a cup
[SPEAKER_00]: or two of kelp meal not the kelp seaweed
extract powder, but put it into a bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and either aerate it or stir it,
just a way to solubilize the material and
[SPEAKER_00]: then water with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I've been using for years for
five gallons is a cup of alfalfa meal and
[SPEAKER_02]: a quarter cup of kelp and then aerate it
overnight and then strain and drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never seen, because I used to
kind of travel around and help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be the first thing I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do an alfalfa kelp tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wanting me to open up a reef case
and then start pulling out bottles of this
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without exception, there was never a
garden that didn't see vast improvement
[SPEAKER_02]: within 48 hours, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing, part of it is I'm
studying now about saponins.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big things, and you might want
to look at this research, is the size
[SPEAKER_02]: being a bio nutrient accumulator,
alfalfa is about 30,000 parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: of saponins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from what I've been reading,
saponins in general, in Asia, the big
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, they use tea seed meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They press the seeds from the tea plant to
do almost every seed growing around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that material uses texturing,
something like saponins, to enhance plant
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll get buried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this isn't anything new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the research is going back
30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that's one of the benefits of
using, that's why when you bubble out
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa, you get a lot of foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's where it's coming from is
30,000 PPMs of saponins and just alfalfa
[SPEAKER_02]: meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to give you a frame of reference,
yucca extract that we used to pay through
[SPEAKER_02]: the nose, for that stuff, it's only
40,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like, hey, for the,
what, 25% reduction, I'll use the alfalfa
[SPEAKER_02]: meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not enough high enough to emulsify
your neem oil though.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the big conundrum for a lot of
people because that process, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: this be nice about it, as you would type
online, a P-I-T-A, you know, you got to do
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to add it to warm water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all those steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't want to do that,
then maybe a better way would be to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: neem meal, which I've recommended and
used, and bubble it out for 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most of the meals, you still
retain seven to 9% oil in the meal of the
[SPEAKER_02]: neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they're able to press it and
get a hundred percent extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's another way to get neem
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem is part of your IPM is making a tea
out of it because you can almost buy neem
[SPEAKER_02]: meal anywhere now around the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes maybe not the neem oil,
but anyway, that's an option too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also good for a soil soak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like mixing all three, kelp,
neem, and alfalfa in the right amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, reduce everything down
and then bubble that out for about 18
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and then apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you got the mucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put that into your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're the one that turned me on to
that idea of taking the neem seed meal and
[SPEAKER_00]: stirring it or aerating it for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cups per five gallons as a way of
treating fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For killing the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand some of the silliness
that gets discussed on gardening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's primarily cannabis bores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will just make something up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm bored today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'll say something really dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: About neem products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, after eight years,
I just got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I won't even respond to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you could drink it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't drink it, but I took a quarter
teaspoon and let's just put it on my
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty vile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the first to admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about mainstream gardening
because I tore out my front yard and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grow a lot of vegetable and some
fruit plants every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing I do after the winter
we were finally getting towards is I
[SPEAKER_02]: sprinkle on a kelp and neem meal and
basalt and then cover it with about an
[SPEAKER_02]: inch of vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have really nice plants and I'm not
out there spraying stuff and I'm not out
[SPEAKER_02]: there except for squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not worried about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I told you the other day,
I've pretty much given up growing trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do powdery mildew free squash plants in
the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard the rumors, but I've never
actually seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never pulled it off organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will find that certain varieties do
better than others, but then I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take the time for my squash or my giant
pumpkins to be out there spraying them
[SPEAKER_00]: every day like some guys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe if you want to put in that
kind of effort or really try and control
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity with a greenhouse or maybe
some filters, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a squash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a product out there that's sold at
nurseries that contains potassium
[SPEAKER_02]: bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In baking, you can use sodium bicarbonate,
baking soda, as the chemical wave as a
[SPEAKER_02]: leavener instead of yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you make quick breads,
cookies, cakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't use yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bakers can also opt to use potassium
bicarbonate, and then they can promote
[SPEAKER_02]: that product as being low sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fungicide they sell, all it is is
potassium bicarbonate and some yucca
[SPEAKER_02]: powder from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like $30 for a half pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this guy named Steve from the NOP?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's written several articles on different
subjects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve starts with an A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Steve Diver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote comparing sodium bicarbonate,
baking soda, and this potassium,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you can buy from a bakery supply,
but I'm not sure everybody wants to drag
[SPEAKER_02]: around 50 pounds of potassium bicarbonate
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sodium bicarbonate is 80% as effective
as the potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy, was it 15 pound bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of Arm and Hammer baking soda for under $7
or $8 at Target, Costco, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in my mind, like we were talking about
our outdoor garden, sodium bicarbonate has
[SPEAKER_02]: been used in the nursery sector since the
20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that it's used is that it
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously the next time it rains or
you're watering or something, it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to rinse off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a really good fungicide for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now indoors, I probably wouldn't recommend
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to have to do like a
big raised bed and you got tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_02]: squashes and peppers and everything,
all you do is you add one tablespoon to a
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dissolves instantly and put it in your
sprayer and have at it and save a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big thing with bicarbonates,
they have to be fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a bag from last year,
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go spend the $8 and get a new bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that article by Steve, he has a list
of, it's not like people hit the lottery
[SPEAKER_02]: and he said, well, I'm going to go on the
bicarbonate business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of things, there's only two
companies that really produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an Arm and Hammer obviously would be in
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the names like, okay, I'm going to
name some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali Green, all those, I mean,
they're all made by one company,
[SPEAKER_02]: Requiem or Bonyde.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know all the names,
the ones you find at Home Depot,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonyde.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you pronounce it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonyde or Bonyde?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it comes down to, yeah,
you got one product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you turn it into, or one material,
you turn it into five products and then
[SPEAKER_02]: for a market, you already got a market
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I started that years ago,
even at ICMA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, read a label and that word inert
or the term inert ingredient just means
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can buy essential oils from Liberty
Natural, we'll say, and get any kind you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got hundreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can spend $300 for a jug of water
that has 0.08% eucalyptus oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because I've always had to,
you know, like be thrifty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't run a nursery using nursery
products that you find at retail
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you go broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're not applying bottled nutrients
to any of our nursery crops or in our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part two of our interview with
Jim Bennett, also known online as
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our next installment, we discuss other
growing ideas in further depth and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of the one from the man
himself, the cultivar that Jim has been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing now for over 40 years.
