[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm at one of the big box
stores today, and I always like to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are yellowing from the bottom
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pale green growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, I think it's probably,
I don't know how these plants are matched.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they're a little dry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my guess is when they are watered,
they're probably over watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may have leached the nutrients
out or they might have run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the pot, but it's a pretty
small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would want to do, in a case like
this, is apply something like a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate, compost tea or compost
extract, even some leachate from a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: bin, which would all be organic options to
get nutrients in there right away and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do something like fish meal or
fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take too long,
all those dry minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some larger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, these, these are a
much darker green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually have a still release
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are also not organic,
so they're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, I think these are maybe a
little heavy in nitrogen, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really see that color coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But slightly downward facing leaves is
usually a sign that too much nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others.
