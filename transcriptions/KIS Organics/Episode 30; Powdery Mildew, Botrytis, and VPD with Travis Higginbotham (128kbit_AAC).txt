[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is a repeat guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to follow up again with Travis
Higginbotham.
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis is the new director of cultivation
support for Fluence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to working at Fluence, he worked at
a state-of-the-art, environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled greenhouse covering 50 acres
where he was the head of research and
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew annual and perennial crops for
big box retailers supplying the
[SPEAKER_02]: northeastern United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: His focus was on rearing beneficial
insects, IPM protocols, disease testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and trialing new genetics from around the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He recently received his master's in
horticulture from Virginia Tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: This resulted in equipping irrigation
booms with lights for photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering applications to a controlled
environment which propagated over 1.2
[SPEAKER_02]: million perennials from stage 3 tissue
culture per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also has a bachelor's of science from
Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Travis, I really appreciate you
coming back on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of stuff that we didn't
get to touch on during our last talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting, and you have this vast
background in controlled environments and
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture that I'd really love to chat
with you about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ted, now I'm happy to be back,
eager to see what we talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this podcast is probably going to jump
around quite a bit, but the first thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to talk about was VPD, which stands
for Vapor Pressure Deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, it's a relationship between
temperature and humidity, and I know
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluence has a VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain what VPD is and how
humidity and dew point are important
[SPEAKER_02]: variables in greenhouse and indoor
environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a loaded question, but I will do my
best here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the VPD chart that we have on our high
PPFD guide is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a guide, and it's for people to kind
of understand what VPD is, because in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways it can be pretty complex,
but hopefully we can walk through it real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and it can be a little bit more
simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the deficit, VPD,
Vapor Pressure Deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the difference between the amount of
moisture in the air and how much the air
[SPEAKER_00]: can hold that moisture in the form of
vapor before it is condensed into dew,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, or before it's condensed into water
droplets on leaves and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I think about VPD,
I think to myself how much space in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air is available for moisture and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually in a greenhouse setting,
you know, based on what we feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: we equate this to humidity, and in a way
they're tied, but in a way they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about how plants use
moisture and how temperature can regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: this and ultimately light can regulate it,
it's through photorespiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, and ultimately
transpiration in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, and CO2 is linked to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to talk about one thing without
having to talk about six others when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to this kind of stuff, but when a
plant takes a CO2 molecule into a stomate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have three orders of magnitude worth
of moisture come out of that stomate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for that process to be
efficient, you have to have space in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air that's open for moisture, and this
allows the plant to transpire and
[SPEAKER_00]: translocate minerals through the plant
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say if the air is completely
saturated with moisture and you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant possibly where you're going
from vapor and clouding in the air of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to puddling on the plant,
it's going to be very hard for that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to breathe, so to say, because there's no
room in the air to keep pushing out
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it's very important to
understand the relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and VPD and why it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to avoid too high of a humidity
in the sense because at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said, the plant can't breathe,
but we're also creating a better
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for mold and mildew at that
point too, on the extreme end of high
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity or high VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how a lot of these pathogens work,
and we can get to mildew, but first we can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about petritis because it's very
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ever-present, it's everywhere,
and you have to have three main conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for a pathogen to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those is for one, you obviously
need the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, you need the adequate temperature for
this pathogen to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three, you need the conducive
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talk about petritis in this
situation, for one, we need the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have petritis spores that are floating
around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually you have moderate
temperatures, which petritis usually lives
[SPEAKER_00]: well and can reproduce in moderate to low
temperatures, especially during the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have moisture present,
which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a spore lands on moisture,
which could be puddled on a leaf due to
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity, that imbibes the spore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spore produces a germ tube,
and that germ tube can sit over cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce enzymes that break down the cell
walls, and then you're infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: petritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was not water puddling on these
tissues, you wouldn't be imbibing petritis
[SPEAKER_00]: spores as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're trying to do is have a good
environment for the plant, but then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: also now with too much vapor and too high
of a humidity, you have a conducive
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for pathogens to infect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildew is similar in that it works a
little different than petritis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it needs a similar environment,
and it can spread extremely fast and start
[SPEAKER_00]: colonizing cell after cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, the way the cell reacts
to mildew, some plants have what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: call a hypersensitive response once they
get infected, and that's the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: against a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say if a powdery mildew infects a
cell, the plant notices this is happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it tells the other cells around the
infected one to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant's thinking there is that it
will inhibit the growth of that pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but however, it's opposite when it comes
to petritis and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that hypersensitive response happens,
and those other cells are dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, now it's easier for the pathogen to
infect those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plant defense responses are
actually beneficial, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: hypersensitive responses in regard to
powdery mildew are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why powdery mildew can colonize
and move so fast when the conducive
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we have those same issues at the low
humidity end of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where temperature and irrigation
strategies also come into play too in
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a point where the conducive
environment will allow pathogens to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: and multiply and infect at a rate that we
can't control.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have the environmental conditions
at a certain level to where we can prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, we also have to know that many
of these pathogens are ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our sanitation practices have to be
in line not only with how we're treating
[SPEAKER_00]: our environment, but also how we
understand the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving back a little bit here,
and I want to talk about treatment options
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not just explaining a problem,
but actually give some options for
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I've noticed with my outdoor
squash, and I think I've mentioned this on
[SPEAKER_02]: previous podcasts, is it seems to me that
it's when there's high fluctuations in
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity outdoors is where
I see powdery mildew move in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have a nice sunny day followed by
a rainy day or vice versa, those big
[SPEAKER_02]: swings in temperature seem to stress the
plant and seem to allow these spores to
[SPEAKER_02]: really take hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always gone under the assumption
that we want to avoid major changes or
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuations in humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: For an indoor environment, because that
seems to cause a lot of the plant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in nature, you'd like to think on
a, let's say not on a rainy day,
[SPEAKER_00]: just during a normal day when the sun
comes up and the sun comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is slowly transitioned,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be at least somewhat of
an acclimation period during each stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in controlled environments,
many times we have environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions turn on, and then they're on
for the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those environmental conditions,
including CO2 and irrigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else turn off during the dark
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blunt on and off are not what plants
receive in nature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants are obviously inclined to favor
what they've genetically in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: received through the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree that we're still fine-tuning,
growers are still learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: fine-tune their systems to most adequately
fit the genetic needs that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up in these plants in their native
habitats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm hearing a lot of growers doing
is having their lights shut off gradually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe half the lights will shut off at
one point and the next set will shut off a
[SPEAKER_02]: few minutes later or ways of reducing that
extreme on and off that you're describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any research or results to
support that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of approach to reduce dew point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you talk a little bit about dew
point?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I wanted to bring up
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so let me think how to... We've done
some studies when studies on slowly at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the day, let's say during
veg, you have long days, 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that the first two hours and
the first hour you slowly increase light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity to somewhat mimic a sunrise,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your photo period and
then towards the last two hours or last
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, you slowly decrease that intensity
again to try to mimic a sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have these, it seems like a good
idea, but when our goal is to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and to increase quality,
during those two hours that we slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: increase and slowly decrease light
intensity, we're losing overall light
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation for that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been hard to justify doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone has yet to iron out
the perfect photo period for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me started on the options of
photo period manipulation with Canvas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like in that regard,
you have to determine what your goal is,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is our goal to treat this plant as perfect
quickly as we can, or is it to crank out
[SPEAKER_00]: as much yield and as much compounds in it
as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, then these gradual
on-off stages are decreasing our overall
[SPEAKER_00]: energy production in the plant because of
the total light accumulation during that
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-hour period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about going then to... If you
knew what your DLI was, the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: light that the plant can take over a given
photo period, if you took that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and had a rate that you wanted to hit
over, say, 20 hours then, or 19 hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: could you then incorporate in some of
these principles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you hit the nail on the head,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that growers do need to talk about
DLI, and once they're under DLI,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can approach these things a
little differently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a DLI of, I don't know,
let's just say 40, and that number came
[SPEAKER_00]: from a duration of 18 hours, but you know
that you want to apply a long day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so if you were to bump your DLI to 41,
I'm not doing the math right here right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but you wanted to bump it to 41,
and that gave you an hour before and an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour after, and now you have a total...
But you were able to slowly increase
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity, then you had your 18 hours,
and then you were able to decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity as well, I think there are ways
that you could go about it, as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't take up your 18 hours, and you
didn't take up that desired DLI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any advantage to it from the
perspective of reducing dew point on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf surface there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, if your temperature mimics the
increase, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature dictates humidity and
dictates dew point a lot, so it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: question, and we're working on a few
things right now, I won't go into too much
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, but all of these environmental
conditions are linked, and I've said that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past, so if we're slowly increasing
light, you know, transpiration of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate and photorespiration,
right, those are all linked to this as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how should CO2 be treated during that
hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: How should temperature gradually increase
from the night temperature, so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate any possible negative effects of
dew point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, in my opinion, is still yet to
be determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is because
everyone's system is so different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you may talk to a grower who has
a system like this, but during their photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period, they may actually bring
temperatures up into 85 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so their temperature regime is so
different from someone who keeps their max
[SPEAKER_00]: up at 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a challenging...
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a challenging point right now,
and I can appreciate the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, the big takeaway then would be
that we just need to be aware of what VPD
[SPEAKER_02]: is and how it relates to humidity,
and that we need to make adjustments based
[SPEAKER_02]: on our own environment as we learn things
and say, okay, well, in my environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to do really well within this
range, and try and maintain and stay at
[SPEAKER_02]: those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree, and we need to try to make
sure that temperatures don't drop too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, right, because the water vapor
will condense, you know, into liquid water
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaves and things when temperature
drops quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we turn off lights and,
you know, the plant process is somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased in overall percent of function,
then we also need to make sure that our
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is adequate in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step with cannabis, I believe,
in controlled environments in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we're gonna have to monitor all of
these things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have to monitor at what pace,
right, do all of these fall in line
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and how can we maximize them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's exciting to be part of an
industry where we're still learning so
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy that aspect of cannabis,
and it's such a fun plant to grow in that
[SPEAKER_02]: regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wanna bring up, just for
listeners to keep in the back of their
[SPEAKER_02]: head, is that ultimately, the cultivar
that you choose is so important when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to mold and mildew resistance,
especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow two of the exact same,
or two of the same plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: different cultivars and get very different
pressures in relation to mold and mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I just wanna touch on that so people
don't get too caught up with this and
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about how important the cultivar
strain they're growing really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can take another second on mildew,
I'd like to say one other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna actually go back to that so that
this is a perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no matter what we do,
you're 100% right that everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: strain dependent, right, or strain
specific, depending on your system,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you define as quality
and even pathogen resistance and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all based on your strain,
but something I wanted to share with your
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners was in the ornamental market,
in the flower market, those growers in one
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, in one acre of greenhouse
probably manage over 10 different genera,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that could probably equate to at least
50 to 60 different varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately maybe 40 different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each plant, like we just said,
responds differently to different
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we've learned in the past
two to three years that's actually been
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented on a commercial scale is how
to make the plant more resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered mildew and fungi and general
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make the plant be tougher,
more tough to combat these pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is what's called silicon,
and it's a mineral nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most plentiful mineral
nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually covers the earth's crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But silicon is not considered a essential
plant nutrient, but a plant can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes in the form, when you apply
it to plants, it comes in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the strategies that's being
used in other crops outside of Canada for
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew prevention, for example,
on zinnias, on roses, even on basil in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases, is adding potassium silicate
to your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would apply this at a certain
parts per million, every seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would slowly build up an
accumulation of silicon in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what silicon does is it's similar to
calcium in that it focuses on the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: walls, and it makes cell walls more stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some degree, it can be so stiff
that it inhibits the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens produce to try to break down
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing to me with how our
agricultural industries are moving away
[SPEAKER_00]: from pesticides and embracing biocontrols,
the extent at which we're going to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: disease and to prevent pest damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now can implement something as silicon
to make the plant so strong in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: that we reduce powdery mildew severity by
up to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the powdery mildew is
actually killed by our preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just growers,
in my opinion, should take some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: dive into the literature in some cases on
some of these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find some very cheap and easy to
implement solutions to some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens just by what's been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the challenge with powdery mildew,
and you mentioned potassium silicate,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, I think, a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We carry a powdered version in our online
store called Agsil 16H.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people now selling it for
the reasons that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a great article which I'll
post on the podcast page about silica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a ton of benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ones I found most interesting
is it actually mitigates micro-toxicities
[SPEAKER_02]: in the leaf surface or in the leaf tissue
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you have a little bit too much
boron or copper or manganese, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll help spread that out so you get less
of a toxic effect in the leaf tissue on
[SPEAKER_02]: top of all the other things that you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to interrupt you,
but that's called soluble silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant converts it into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when you apply, let's say,
Agsil, the plant converts it into soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon and then polymerized silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polymerized is what helps you on your cell
walls, and the soluble is what helps you
[SPEAKER_00]: transport a lot of these other mineral
nutrients, as you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I found is that
cannabis in particular seems to just
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive on potassium even more than other
vegetable crops and ornamentals that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, getting that extra potassium is in
general a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a good mix, but the one thing I
do want to mention is that it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: organic, and that's important for a lot of
our listeners and at least something to be
[SPEAKER_02]: aware of when you are applying something
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some forms out there that can be,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen other silica products,
but in terms of what you mentioned there
[SPEAKER_02]: with the amount of available silicon,
there tend to be a lot lower so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not necessarily plants available.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people put rice hulls in their
media because they're high in silica,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not in a form that the plant can
take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're waiting for months potentially
for some of this to become available to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant as it gets broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crop times that we deal with,
there's no point in adding rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard strategies of how you can break
down rice hulls and then apply a powder
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you can have a plant response in
less than two weeks when you integrate a
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the growers I meet are not
using a loose substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using these compressed blocks of
whether it be core peat or rock wool,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you couldn't even mix in something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a challenge to get a product
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to touch on your potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned similar things like you have
with potassium being important with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but we have to be careful
because potassium also regulates EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the more potassium you include in your
fertilizer, you increase your EC also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a little harder for the
fertilizer to be taken into the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because the water's a little saltier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at your nutrition,
you want to apply potassium in a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one ratio with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely want to talk about
nutrition because I think you have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: to share there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we do, can we talk a little bit
more about strategies for dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: these particular, like botrytis and
powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, some of the other ones that I'm aware
of out there are, let's see, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur burners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one option that I hear that a lot of
people have used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lactobacillus, through raw milk and some
of the enzymes in there, there's been some
[SPEAKER_02]: research on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's potassium bicarbonate,
and then there's another form of
[SPEAKER_02]: bicarbonate that you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's GreenCure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blanking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you familiar with other,
more organic options out there in their
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy around cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, powdery mildew is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, like in the ornamental
market, it's so tough to control in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just breeding away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making plants that are just
resistant to it, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like now there's, instead of in
patients that were covered in mildew in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past, now we have resistant genetics
that won't even get infected with mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how other markets are dealing with
it because it's such a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think things like silicon in
your constant feed just automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a strong buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as other measures, like I've
seen some growers who, they get plugs from
[SPEAKER_00]: other suppliers, and you automatically
have to treat these plugs as infected
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even if the supplier's completely
clean, it's just a safe bet to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine program, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's products out there,
and I could list an array of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, I've learned that one
product will work in one state,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that same product will not work in
another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really is frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right, there's potassium
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's called milstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the sulfur burners and
bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe sulfur burners work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be careful because that can,
at too high of concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not too healthy also for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have some burn on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But elemental sulfur as sprays helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my advice is, I would have something
in your feed, whether it be silicon or
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of calcium chloride,
to help the plant strengthen its cell
[SPEAKER_00]: walls to reduce overall infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have preventative sprays in place
with potassium bicarbonate, or even have
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporized, diffused sulfur in your growing
environment to try and help mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever microenvironments that you have
that could harbor powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And third, if we had a cultural change,
I would say if growers can, and this can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a struggle, but if you can get your
airflow to two meters per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you are automatically kind of
diffusing all of the microclimates into
[SPEAKER_00]: one in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, the more airflow you have,
the less chance that you're gonna have of
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew actually having a stabilized
population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about airflow really
quickly in relation to mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen some people where they're
just blasting the plant and it affects
[SPEAKER_02]: their transpiration rates in the hopes of
preventing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've seen other people where they
want the air coming out underneath the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy and being pulled up through the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then mostly what I see is fans up
above the canopy to help cool the lights
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep that heat from coming down to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously with LEDs, that changes a
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are we looking for in an indoor
environment for airflow in terms of where
[SPEAKER_02]: we should be positioning our fans relative
to our canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and I would say that that is
definitely defined by what regulations you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so are we dealing with large plants,
very few plants, but large plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we dealing with a ton of small plants
in a grow and they're shorter and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not so big with so much canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is really where we first
have to ask, okay, what kind of plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage of plant, the size of plant are
we dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, are you able to
position fans underneath the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you also able to do either
horizontal or vertical airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like in lettuce, and we can
learn from other industries, if we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, lettuce has a problem and it's
called leaf hip burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is due to calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because with LEDs as sole source
lighting or supplemental lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you try to push the plant at a
certain pace with a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and a certain temperature,
the plant can't translocate nutrients fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up in the new growth having
cells that don't mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, it looks like burn
because those cells die and they stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: and they split.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a way to fix this is with vertical
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does exactly what you said,
when you have airflow that comes directly
[SPEAKER_00]: down onto the plant, you're automatically
increasing transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you work to increase airflow,
you would obviously need to also change
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you perceive the plant's
transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that mean changing EC a little
bit, bringing it down just a little bit so
[SPEAKER_00]: things can move to the plant easier?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting, I get some of
these same questions and it all depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you would want some airflow that
yes, touches the plant from the side and
[SPEAKER_00]: also from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the main thing with mildew is can
you get inside the canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you usually have a bordering edge,
which is called the buffer zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these plants that are bound in the
middle, those in the middle can harbor
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many populations throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not careful during the night
period, they can spread to your outer
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's very hard to get control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to manage our canopy to making
sure that you can that airflow can go
[SPEAKER_02]: through there to reduce the spore pressure
in the areas that are getting less
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other industries, they just space
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have the available space,
they just space them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this crop, in this industry right
now, that's the last thing I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend somebody's spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a challenge right now
trying to get airflow in between the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first started growing,
I was told that you want to be able to see
[SPEAKER_02]: through the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how they, you know, just the two
second lesson on pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as I got into it more and more,
people started looking at how far light is
[SPEAKER_02]: penetrating the canopy and then removing
leaves that were below, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain PPFD, for example, in that
canopy because they just weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesizing light as effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were potentially places where
mold and mildew could take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about pruning leaves,
we're talking about pruning viable solar
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that people are worried about
different wavelengths penetrating,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a certain amount of leaves to
where, let's say, by the fourth leaf down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting any benefit from the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where fluence, I think,
really separates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to have a sales pitch here,
but that's where full spectrum truly comes
[SPEAKER_00]: into play, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a multitude of spectra, when it's being
applied properly, you can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, red and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to penetrate one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be absorbed as soon as it
touches the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other spectrum actually channel
through the leaves and do have
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic ability as they travel
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is the extent of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all based on your density and light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have seen systems where they prune
the heck out of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand why, and it's for the
reasons you say, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking those leaves are generating
your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if anything, pruning at certain
stages could be effective for the
[SPEAKER_00]: objective of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during flowering, when you're focused
on buds, and let's say by the end of week
[SPEAKER_00]: five in flowering, and at the end of week
six, your flowers and your buds should be
[SPEAKER_00]: formed, that may be a good time to
actually take some leaves away and focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, any energy that
could be harnessed during that time goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that in the future,
I'm getting more and more hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see what the threshold is
with pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, what you're hitting on is
that you can use pruning as a trigger too
[SPEAKER_02]: with the plant in terms of stressing it
and removing excess fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, to focus its energy on bud
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's naturally trying to senesce,
it's ending its life cycle, it's trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, these are not viable in that
sense because they haven't been
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated, but the plant's still going
through that process, and by removing all
[SPEAKER_02]: these excess leaves, the plant really has
to focus its energy into its bud
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound about right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant process is going to be
dictated by photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting of leaves, yes, I would say
abscission causes a certain level of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, but overall, if you're under a
short day, the plant's going to be focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that some leaves can be a
nutritional sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some older leaves that let's say most
likely look pretty rough to the naked eye
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to newer fresh leaves,
those could be a sink for macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, if they're darker green,
if they have some chlorosis, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, definitely prune them because
they're taking away from what is the newer
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in flowering, during a short day,
I wouldn't say that the stress helps the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in regard to pruning, but more if
you were to prune and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: re-channels the focus from going into
those leaves and goes into the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that came off clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I'm asking is because I've
seen, there's a book out there and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like thousands of dollars or something
crazy where the guy, I think he's out of
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, recommends removing all fan
leaves in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So literally all you have is these bud
sites and they claim it maximizes their
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a few people have tried it and
gotten decent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always attributed it to excessive
sort of plant stress that's opening you up
[SPEAKER_02]: to more diseases and other problems,
but potentially allowing the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: focus more of its energy on its bud sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I haven't really ever wrapped my
brain around how removing all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic or potential, all that leaf
surface is actually gonna benefit the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall plant health and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to be careful because I've
seen strategies of let's say reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen towards the end of flowering,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And either that's to apply a stress or
that's to try to not have so much nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated in the bud or applying a
stress through water stressing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of flower or cutting off
leaves, like you're saying, obsidian
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress can be a good thing when we
understand what it does and how it does
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we apply stress, too much stress,
the plant's gonna put all of its energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into combating that stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not gonna be focused on what we
want it to be focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there, and to your point,
we still have so much to learn on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate stress to increase quality and
to increase yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next question is half of these
compounds, and it depends on who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to, when are they produced and why
are they produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's theories all around on why the
plant produces them, but then,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what causes an excess production of
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we harness that energy if so we need
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're applying stress to obsidian,
maybe we don't need the leaves because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, this plant is just
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, and the other factor is on a
commercial scale, you just don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: labor to prune that much in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the growers I know that are
producing on scale are typically staffed
[SPEAKER_02]: but running around crazy and don't have
time to go through and remove all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not be beneficial based on the
difference in yield and what we know about
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stress and all the reasons that you
just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor is a huge cost, and that certainly
needs to be a priority that's taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, if anything, if you go
into in there and pruning is part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, Integrated Pest Management Schedule,
so if you end up seeing environments that
[SPEAKER_00]: are forming within the canopies,
I would prune so you wouldn't have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in there and you see leaves that
look like they're nutrient sinks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prune that out so the rest of the
plant can use the nutrition properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would not prune for an
abscission stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's simplify this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take me through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna go through a room and scout
for powdery mildew and botrytis and for
[SPEAKER_02]: pests and insects, in theory on a daily
basis if you're staffed for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to know what's going on in your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you come across a plant that has
powdery mildew, say at some point,
[SPEAKER_02]: how are you gonna treat that in a flower
room, for example, where you don't wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing any foliar applications for
numerous reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: What options do you have besides removing
the infected material?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to mildew, you don't have many
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I really push having things in
your constant fertigation system because
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps you when you get to a case like
this, because hopefully it prevents a case
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in there scouting and you
end up finding, when you end up finding
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, pruning would be the first option,
but then you're touching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly be spreading it,
doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is if you have
any ability to space the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would space them so either those leaves
could be exposed to light or air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dry them out and you fry them with
light intensity, the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you possibly can't apply any spray
under the buds, I guess it depends on your
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations there, then you would
obviously try to hit it with some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting approach though that I
wanna mention that's come out through a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called BioSafe is a product,
I believe it's called Prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, it's a microorganism and
I can't think of the strain right off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my head right now, but it's four
applications to prevent powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: petritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you would apply it as a
foliar spray and it actually colonizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue so petritis and powdery mildew
cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has no, it's completely an
environmentally friendly item to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it takes up the real estate before
petritis and powdery mildew try to move
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my mind, if you're gonna have
any success with powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all gonna be due to your prevention
strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we wanna grow cultivars that are
less susceptible to PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to manage our relative humidity
and VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to treat all plants that come into
the facility by either dipping or spraying
[SPEAKER_02]: and quarantining.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to keep our clothing and
everything, our access to the room really
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled so that we're not creating any
new vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, spores are
gonna make it into your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such, no one's growing in a
clean room per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, it's just a matter of
managing, like you said, using IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies to really keep everything as
controlled as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's a great way to bring it
all together, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other one that we touched on at
first, but haven't gotten back to yet is
[SPEAKER_02]: petritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, it's the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it spreads so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw it in a crop,
I started doing a whole bunch of research
[SPEAKER_02]: and read just how quickly it can spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It multiplies so rapidly when it gets in
ideal environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we really treat that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's always happening at the end
of flower, and it's just a big problem for
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, petritis is finicky because it's
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting all over our face right now
as we talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually worked on petritis for my
masters, and we tried to use strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: using UV light to kill it on contact with
as short of a dose as 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with LEDs and UV, it's very,
very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible right now to have such
a high radiational wavelength in the form
[SPEAKER_00]: of an LED, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not efficient at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's technology out there from other
companies that use UV, UVB, and UVC for
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization of certain pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, my point in saying that is I
even went so far as to use UV because
[SPEAKER_00]: petritis is so hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with petritis is first,
it's key too, because the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of petritis, there's a stage called
sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fungus can produce, it's referred
to as an overwintering structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this structure is formed when the
environment is not conducive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's say you have, petritis likes
cooler temperatures, anything below 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, it usually performs much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can perform at higher, but it performs
much better and much more effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when temperatures are consistently
higher, up into the 80s and 85,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can transform into the sclerotia form.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that form, it can tolerate pretty much
most environmental conditions it'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with, and even some chemical
products it can still withstand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where these sclerotia take place is
they are on dead plant material on your
[SPEAKER_00]: tables, they're on the floors,
they're in the cracks, they're in places
[SPEAKER_00]: that you wouldn't think twice to even
clean, but they're staying in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're staying dormant until the
environmental conditions come to where
[SPEAKER_00]: petritis is known to grow, and then it
triggers it back into the reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think people don't take
sanitation seriously enough in between
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest is all plant material every day
that falls or any cut material needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up because petritis will go
dormant and it will colonize and grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not careful, you can have a
sporadic colony grow on there and air hit
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have thousands of spores in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaning is huge when it comes to
petritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, there's not many things
you can spray on petritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think in the future UV light
may have some potential on killing
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens on contact when you're not
allowed to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cleaning and sanitation daily and in
between crops, I mean, scrubbing the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners of the room, scrubbing under the
tables and hosing things down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's critical when it comes to petritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you know, as terrible as a lot of
these pests and diseases are, at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time, it's pretty amazing the survival and
reproduction strategies that nature has
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: In these cases, I have to kind of tip my
hat to a certain extent, too, to these
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I hear a lot of growers
doing in organics is just taking their
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves off of their plants when they trim
and using them as a mulch right there on
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always sort of been against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the reasons that you just
listed are the biggest reasons why we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure we're removing all leaf
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't mean just throwing in a
bucket and leaving it in the corner of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to clean your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're if you're doing that,
you know, you want to go back in with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, these are all things that people
need to think about with their workflow to
[SPEAKER_02]: really reduce the amount of pressure that
they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's using leaves on top of the
soil as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a haven for thrips or
spider mites eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it's dark under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually cooler under there and it's
usually more moist under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have petritis thrive in those
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a no-no.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we haven't even gotten to the topic
that you wanted to talk about when we
[SPEAKER_02]: first chatted before the podcast,
which was nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if now's a good time to
touch on that or if you want to take it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely something I wanted to
hear your thoughts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can I can talk about it briefly,
at least the things that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulated should be thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first thing that needs to
be said is you need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition in regard to your substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to understand how your
struggle how your substrate buffers or how
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly it uses the nutrition delivery
system for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regard to rockwool, that's
considered hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the fertigation strategies
that are applied to rockwool are also
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to just flowing water for herb
production in hydroponic systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in regard to core compressed core or
compressed peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's we're getting close to
the age where many growers of multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: industries are going to start to use wood
fiber because it's truly a renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource and a renewable substrate
compared to some of the alternatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wood fiber is a very complex molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into that because
that's more of an IPM thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these different substrates have
different buffering capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rockwool will have a continuous feed
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have differences much
in pH like you would in different
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I'd say that you
need to understand first is what substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you going to choose it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you going to deliver nutrients
through that substrate to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you going to manage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I think everyone understands
EC pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're getting to the point where they
do an EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the amount of saltiness your
fertilizer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many how much salt is present?
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast can the plant take it up in
liquid form is based on its saltiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase or decrease of EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually due to high
concentrations, high PPMs in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on if you have a delivery
system of one to 50 or one to 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then your EC at the end of the
hose is going to be different based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your injection rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without going too much into the
substrate and looking more on just the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition in general, some key rules of
thumb to keep in mind are first off,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what fertilizer you're using,
I would mix it how your vendor recommends
[SPEAKER_00]: that you mix it and you allow it to go
through your injectors and you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample at the end of that hose and you
send it into a lab and you get a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can help you and you can't help
yourself until you have seen what's on
[SPEAKER_00]: that nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is all the micros
and all the macros listed out in parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what your plant's receiving
or that's exactly what your substrate's
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is a huge priority for any
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know anything from a label,
to be quite frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to just allow these things to go
through your systems and then see after
[SPEAKER_00]: your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because injection rates, we can do the
math, but they're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still at least a five to 10
percent error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within some of these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be too firm on the numbers on
your piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them sent into a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see these parts per million of
macros and micros, let's first start with
[SPEAKER_00]: the macros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have NPK, nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rule of thumb for nitrogen and potassium
is you need a one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a hundred parts nitrogen,
you need a hundred parts potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is known to regulate EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you want to restrict growth
or encourage growth, you can add more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less potassium, increase or decrease your
EC and you can control growth that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus on the other hand, if you're
not careful, you can have deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see here, we talk about
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: A baseline number for phosphorus,
12 parts per million is the lowest you
[SPEAKER_00]: should ever go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're trying to pinch pennies
and you want to apply as less the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of fertilizers you can,
that's 12 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at saturation point with phosphorus
at 24 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go up past 24, there's not
been anywhere shown that there's a benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's growth benefits when you
understand how to manipulate phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some crops, especially in mother
stock crops, you can manipulate inner node
[SPEAKER_00]: between nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to manipulate the links with
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also inhibit flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if let's say you're a grower and you're
struggling to get the amount of yield that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want and you've never done a nutrient
analysis for all you know, you could lack
[SPEAKER_00]: in phosphorus and that's reducing your
overall yield because it's inhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus is critical to be,
I would say at least at 20, 20 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million and you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 is the saturation, you're even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above 24, it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything below 12, you're going to see
deficiencies and start really hurting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium and magnesium are two that need to
be understood because if they're out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, you then will have deficiencies
of one or the other or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: When thinking about calcium, you need a
ratio at least of three to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: three being calcium and one being
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because they don't interact well
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a trumpet with calcium so you
can still get the plant to absorb both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, and if you understand how to
mix your own salts, you want a five to one
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of calcium to magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's multiple ways and it's
fascinating and I don't think cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: even touched on this yet, but there's
multiple ways in regard to light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: and photosynthetic rate on how you can
manipulate nutrients in relation to light
[SPEAKER_00]: and control the plant so much more
precisely than we do right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and basically what you shared I
think is really important if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing using ionic nutrients or mineral
salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how do we apply that to organic
growing where we're actually in living
[SPEAKER_02]: soils in media that contains a lot of high
levels of microorganisms that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling these nutrients for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a lot of the same principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, right now,
all I can tell you is that side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I say that is because I
hear of these living soils, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure plenty of them, I've heard
plenty of them work fabulously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because those companies have done
the science in the background to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how these microorganisms have
mutualistic relationships and symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with each other and also the
substrate and the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain bacteria work together to
produce nitrogen and ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think right now, it's hard to
regulate organic nutrition like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral salt nutrition because there's so
many microorganisms that can have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions that's hard to have precision
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some companies have it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even including castings of certain
larvae and other microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can even rear nematodes inside wax
moth larvae in living soils if you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to prevent entrance of fusarium
carried by fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different strategies out
there that I don't think are ironed out
[SPEAKER_00]: just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, if you have the ability
to mix your own salts, I think that first
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be figured out with this crop
before we try to figure it out with
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic mineral nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I totally agree with you that we
don't have it figured out from an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these living soils, I don't think we
ever truly will just because of the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are so many different complex
interactions going on, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rhizosphere between the plants and
its exudates, the nutrients that it's able
[SPEAKER_02]: to uptake through these different
microbial communities that are so
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly complex that we're still
learning about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how antagonistic or symbiotic various
microbes are, and many of which we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: even identified or can't culture in a lab
to really study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I totally agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, what I'm seeing is,
because this is basically our side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and what I'm really passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I totally get why it's something that
you're not as into coming from an
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental industry perspective,
because this just doesn't exist over there
[SPEAKER_02]: for numerous reasons that make a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're doing is looking at soil
testing, you know, an acid extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: using like a maleic three test,
for example, or something similar as a way
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeing all of what nutrients are
potentially in the soil, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: plants available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then comparing throughout the cycle
and at the end of the cycle and seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: what's being used up by the plant over
that period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reamending that same soil as a
way of maintaining those levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you can think of it in the same
principle as a grower constantly using the
[SPEAKER_00]: same nutrition in a concentrated
concentrate, what's the word tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that you irrigate with a
certain fertilizer concentrate with rock
[SPEAKER_00]: wool, you use that same tank in the same
recycled water over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again, those mineral nutrients are
going to be taken up at different
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages at different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day three, you're going to have a
different ratio of those nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tank versus day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will take up these and use
these minerals so differently that we
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly have to keep amending them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just I'm just going to go on a short
rant here really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I've noticed about this,
the cannabis industry, and you may not
[SPEAKER_02]: have seen this coming from the nursery
side of things, but people will come up,
[SPEAKER_02]: used to come up to me and they'd be like,
hey, have you tried product X?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, no, I've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll research it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And either A, it's something that is got
common ingredients, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you could find, you could find a
much cheaper version of, or what I find
[SPEAKER_02]: more commonly is that grower will be like,
hey, my buddy tried it and he got the most
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing results ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll look at the product and let's
just say it's a, it's a phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there may be the reason that his buddy
got such a great result is because his
[SPEAKER_02]: soil was low in phosphorus or his nutrient
program was low in phosphorus and that
[SPEAKER_02]: boost in phosphorus caused his plant to be
healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, he did great or, but that doesn't
mean that that product is magical and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily the right product for your
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your soil is already high in phosphorus
or your fertigation program already has
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate levels of phosphorus,
it may, it may be have negative effects on
[SPEAKER_02]: your, on your soil or on your overall
plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that's something that a
lot of growers don't take into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration when they're looking at all
these different products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, they just look at it either as
beneficial or detrimental and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're not taking into account all
the other variables that have to interact
[SPEAKER_02]: with within an, you know, a proper
nutrition program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's part of the reason I
said that first, before you, you dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrition, understand what the
capabilities holding and buffering
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities as starter charges of your
substrates and then figure out how are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to measure your nutrition in those
substrates and then start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrition and how you're going to
deliver it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you have to understand the
soil first and you can't just take,
[SPEAKER_00]: take something by, you know, by word of
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to trial it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to see it perform yourself and
you have to send in and get an analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: run so you know exactly what's being
delivered to your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't use EC in the same way with
organic soil as you would with Rockwell or
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these hydroponic programs that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen people use EC if they didn't
want to do or didn't have time to do
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and say that their EC was at a
certain level and then they try and hit
[SPEAKER_02]: that same level with their re-amendment
program, but it's not very accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the numbers are going to be off the
charts for organic soil versus Rockwell
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of these other more inert media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be different forms of
minerals, hence the difference in EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC is going to be different coming out
of your hose as it is if you were to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: leach test out of your substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, was there more you wanted to talk
about in regards to nutrition?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was really helpful what you
shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned some stuff because I've never
looked at it strictly from a nutrient and
[SPEAKER_02]: a PPM perspective because I've always used
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's never something I've looked at in
quite that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, you know, I don't really have too
much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the future, you know,
we could maybe have a discussion over more
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more as I learn more about this crop
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in the future, we can talk
about organic nutrition down to the PPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we can mix mixed substrates
with certain, you know, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages of this type of carbon versus
this type of carbon and try to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, degradable cycles and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the end of the day,
that's the right direction to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have a lot to learn,
like you said, but no, I appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you bring that up, but I wonder
how do we do that if every soil is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have different microbial concentrations
and diversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: So our nutrient cycling rates are going to
vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may have the same inputs,
but at the end of the day, I just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: see how we really, you know, completely
dial in that level of complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're getting out of nature right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, and I think that's going to
take, you know, certain companies are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to invest in labs and,
you know, other industries do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to get to the point
where they understand the interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've tested the interactions
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take, let's say you want a certain
trichoderma, mycorrhizae, bacillus strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a selective media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a petri dish that only grows
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to compare that
relationship with another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can put those on the same
plate together and see how they interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then extract that, put it into a
liquid concentration and test it and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what enzymes or what mineral nutrients
were produced from that interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is half of the products,
they give you a cocktail of over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my mind, part of the reason they
give you a cocktail is because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping some of those, or at least 50% of
them are going to have a relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in nature, wherever, let's say a
petunia was native to, there's one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: of one microorganism that has a true
relationship with that petunia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the products that we apply on
petunias have a cocktail of microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: because growers are hoping that they'll
see a response from one of these strains
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't know yet which strain
does the response that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'd add to that, I heard Colin
Bell with Mammoth Microbes talk and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how they created their
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially it's a combination of four
different strains of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And individually, the plant response they
got from the four of them was not nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was as those four combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just through trial and error
that they came up with what they came up
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is this sort of synergistic
effect too that we don't totally
[SPEAKER_02]: understand either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to learn there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to chat again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed this conversation and I
learned a lot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've sort of been on the job for a
little while, I know this is still a new
[SPEAKER_02]: industry to you and you're starting to
visit more cannabis facilities and learn
[SPEAKER_02]: more about this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, no, I'd love to always enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're learning every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I can appreciate your listeners
because all of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they care so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trialing new things and they're
all seeing different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we're going to have to find
a way to kind of come together as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and be like, okay, what have we
learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, what can we put in as some
industry standards to actually move this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop along together?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, learning every day, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, again, I really appreciate your
time today and I look forward to chatting
[SPEAKER_02]: again here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk to you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Travis Higginbotham with Fluence
Bioengineering, manufacturers of LED
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting for the horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their website is Fluence.Science,
or you can type Fluence lighting into
[SPEAKER_02]: Google and it will be the first link.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_02]: blog at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as links to the data and
information we discussed in this episode
[SPEAKER_02]: on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
I'll see you next time.
