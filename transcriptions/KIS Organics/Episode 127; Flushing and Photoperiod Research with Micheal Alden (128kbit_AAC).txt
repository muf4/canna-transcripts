[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Michael Alden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael is the research director at
Stairway Holding and explores methods to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve efficiency and productivity in
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spent the past five years as a graduate
research assistant with Dr. Jim Foss
[SPEAKER_01]: studying the flowering physiology of
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: For his master's and for his PhD,
he studied cannabis at Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to watch your future cannabis
project presentation, and I'll link to
[SPEAKER_02]: that in the podcast episode page.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you could tell us a little bit
about yourself and some of the research
[SPEAKER_02]: you started doing, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my bachelor's from the University
of Florida, in horticultural sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go to graduate school,
and so I got hooked up with Jim Foss here
[SPEAKER_00]: at Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my master's on poinsettia research,
poinsettia flowering physiology with
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod and temperature responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kind of rolled that into a
dissertation project with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had gotten approval to start growing
hemp on the greenhouses on Clemson campus
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to kind of roll what we
were doing with poinsettias already into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then wanted to expand a lot of those
things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoperiod was the first interest for Jim
and I starting off the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of actually rolled into
asking questions about flushing and height
[SPEAKER_00]: control and some other projects as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what made you so interested in
photoperiod, and how does that relate to
[SPEAKER_02]: your research with poinsettias?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I remember taking my
undergrad physiology classes, and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: thought photoperiod was so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the professor had Rebecca
Darn, who took two semesters of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had a really, really interesting
way of just talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences that we see with photoperiod,
and just even how the genetic regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering and such with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always just was kind of interesting
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with poinsettias, the project we
had gotten started on was heat delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where around September,
when poinsettias will naturally start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, if there's high temperatures at
that time, it'll delay the flowering which
[SPEAKER_00]: will inevitably result in the poinsettias
being immature when they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped out to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you're sitting on plants
that won't get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that we looked at was,
okay, well, if you're at September,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, photoperiods are going to be
close to about 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if we lengthen, or sorry,
shorten the photoperiod and lengthen the
[SPEAKER_00]: night length?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found eventually was that
if you can overcome a lot of this heat
[SPEAKER_00]: delay by just providing a longer night
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that just means using blackout for
a longer duration than you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing under natural day
conditions, if you don't have black cloth
[SPEAKER_00]: available, then you're stuck with those
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of poinsettia or ornamental
growers do have black cloth available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of our end result of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say heat delay, are you
talking about being too warm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So greenhouse temperature is getting
around 80 to 90 degrees during the day,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially high night temperatures can
have a detrimental effect on the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if it was still too warm,
if you just reduce the amount of light,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically in terms of photoperiod,
that really fixed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you think about it with
short day plants, as they're going from
[SPEAKER_00]: long days in the summer to short days in
the winter, you know, there's this gradual
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the flowering stimulus that's
being produced by these shorter days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're in September around a
12 hour photoperiod, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's let's say a level five,
level five out of 10 flowering stimulus
[SPEAKER_00]: being generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have high temperatures at
that time, then it's going to knock that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stimulus level maybe to like a
three or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we extend out that or if we shorten
that photoperiod, then we can raise it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to if it's nice temperatures, maybe to
like a nine or a 10, like a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the high temperatures being still
there, they'll knock it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never eliminate heat delay entirely
by shortening the photoperiod,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you overcome a lot of it that would
otherwise make your plants too late to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was your hypothesis in regards to
Amper cannabis and how it might respond to
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiod?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, it's obviously a very
strongly correlated photoperiod of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we knew that the standard
was 12-12 for flowering and 18-6 for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just curious, would anything
else work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had seen that, you know,
using different photoperiods with
[SPEAKER_00]: poinsettias was having a tremendous
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the second chapter of my
photoperiod research with poinsettias,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we found that once you get past
the flower initiation phase, the different
[SPEAKER_00]: night lengths that you can provide really
don't impact flowering too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can provide a 10, 11 or 12 hour
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are mostly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that changes with a shorter
photoperiod is that those lower bracts are
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit more red, a little more
deep in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I figured with cannabis,
maybe that some of these varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily flower too well at 12
hours, maybe there's some benefit with
[SPEAKER_00]: going shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had seen that with sunset,
with sunsets, you know, an animal
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you flower at 12, it's never going
to be ready in eight weeks to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was kind of what we were
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the vegetative side,
you know, we wanted to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there any difference with going to a 16
hour photoperiod?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, we know some indoor growers
are providing 24 hour photoperiods inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for their vegetative propagation
or stock plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just talk a little about your
experimental design.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you decided to set up this experiment
to look at different, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: day lengths, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are night lengths, if you want to
look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you decide on for your
experiment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we've done five different
photoperiod experiments, but I guess we
[SPEAKER_00]: can just talk about this first one,
because the other ones are pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, we kind of tweaked the
experiment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main idea was that we wanted to,
we had three varieties, sunset,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG and tiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was because Alison Justice at the
hemp mine, she had provided us with the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and she told us, you know,
these were three that were clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: different from each other in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to use, you know,
different varieties, because if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: use the same kind of, same photoperiod
responses, you're not going to get too
[SPEAKER_00]: much differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we want to cast a wider net.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we did was, okay,
we want to provide different photoperiod
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the question is how you're
going to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because naturally, you know, if you think
about providing a 10, 11 or 12-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod, then you say, well,
the 12-hour photoperiod is going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more light than a 10-hour photoperiod
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did later on in the
photoperiod experiments where we
[SPEAKER_00]: compensated, or we expected that we're
going to have different DLIs with these
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this first experiment all of the
photoperiods had the same exact DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we did that was we had this
blackout greenhouse and we had four
[SPEAKER_00]: benches that we split into these different
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the plants got supplemental
lighting and natural day sunlight for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: hours every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the greenhouse would close down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the lights would shut off,
except for these little bulbs that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: in each of these zones that were separated
from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's say with a 10-hour
photoperiod, all the lights would turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bulbs would turn off right when
the greenhouse closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 11-hour photoperiod, those little
bulbs would stay on for just one more
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 12-hour photoperiod would stay on for
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those little bulbs, they were just
enough to keep the plants awake,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially, to stimulate the day length
photoperiod response, but not enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: create any differences in yield or plant
mass or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the differences in photoperiod length
were controlled just by this little tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: light bulb, is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't get any extra light,
per se, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't able to really see a night
period for quite as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way, we could say the 10- and
12-hour photoperiod, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had the same DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how did the morphology of the plants
change based on the photoperiods?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we were more interested
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology, the cannabinoids and all
that kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for listeners who aren't as familiar
with some of the terms, morphology just
[SPEAKER_02]: refers to the structure and the shape of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're talking about this,
one question I had when you said that you
[SPEAKER_02]: chose cultivars that were all very
different, were they different in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid expression?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they different in terms of terpene
expression?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or were they different in terms of days to
finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were these differences that Allison
highlighted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe it was primarily photoperiod
differences, essentially, that she would
[SPEAKER_00]: put these out in the field at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain varieties are flowering in
August, and then others aren't flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: until maybe late September or ready to
harvest until October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one variety like tiger,
that one, Allison had to put supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting in the fields even in the summer
to keep it vegetative, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just start flowering under any
day length outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very handy trait for a lot of
growers around the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're in like a tropical
area and you have a variety that can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower at a 16, 18-hour photoperiod,
you can get two, three crops a year
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, which is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess let's skip ahead to the results
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were your findings based off of
the photoperiod differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first experiment, we found that
the shorter the photoperiod, basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller the plants were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be beneficial for a number
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing was that we weren't
really measuring this on like a per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't really interested in yield
per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just more interested in the
changes in the actual mass of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found that the plant mass was
the lowest at the shorter photoperiods,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also had these really,
really compact flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flowers looked like a lot more
mature and well-developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigmas were very orange and brown,
which indicates that the inflorescences
[SPEAKER_00]: are fairly developed, very frosty looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus as you get to the 11, the 11 was
pretty much the same, but once you start
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the 12 or even the 13,
you notice that the inner nodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers look a little fluffier,
a little less frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the frostiness to them and the stigma
start to become a little more white rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than orange and brown, which would
indicate that the flower isn't quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: matured as it is at the shorter
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets worse and worse as you go
to like 13, 14, and up to 16 and 18 like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant matured faster at shorter
photoperiods at 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 hours was your baseline, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 hours was the shortest photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was your minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at 10 hours, the plants matured faster,
but your overall biomass was lower and you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't really look at yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have like a hunch on where yields
would land on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they landing probably lower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be a great follow-up
experiment moving forward with people that
[SPEAKER_00]: do photoperiod research is that when you
have these smaller plants, let's say a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter photoperiod, you're getting major
electrical cost savings if you're a sole
[SPEAKER_00]: source grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have these smaller plants,
you can't necessarily look at growing
[SPEAKER_00]: these like you would with much bigger
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the advantage is, is that you're
going to have these smaller plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can eliminate a lot of trellis netting
with, and then you can also put more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can grow, let's say 10 plants
per square meter at a 12-hour photoperiod,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you can probably get 14,
15, 16 plants at a 10-hour photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some of the dynamics that
have to be accounted for, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're looking at yield on an area
basis that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with your example there, 14 plants
instead of 10 plants in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: four-by-four space, we're using a 10-hour
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saving two hours of electricity
every night to create essentially what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're saying would be possibly the same
canopy and possibly close to the same
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just faster because the plants are
maturing quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of what you're saying
potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with our height control
research, this is a whole different topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we found that the more plants you can
fit into a growing area, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more yield you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is well studied in many,
many crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just type in planting density on
Google Scholar, and you'll find tons and
[SPEAKER_00]: tons of research on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pretty much every other crop in the
world is grown at these super high
[SPEAKER_00]: planting densities to maximize photon
capture on an area basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with these bigger plants,
it's really a lot more inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by getting your plants smaller with
a shorter photoperiod, you can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the photon capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really overall, I would expect
improved yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never did that per se, so I don't
want to say that's a guarantee or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always said it this way, and correct
me if it's wrong, but it's fairly similar
[SPEAKER_02]: to what you're saying but slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in cannabis, you'll have people growing
one plant, and they'll veg for three
[SPEAKER_02]: months, sometimes four months because they
need to fill the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be plant counts back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have other people doing
the sea green style where you put out a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of plants at once to create a
similar canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always looked at it like it
doesn't matter your plant count so much as
[SPEAKER_02]: your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your canopy dictates your yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you use one plant or 20 plants to
create that canopy, your yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume, would be comparable if
your canopies are comparable, though one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's highly inefficient because of the
amount of veg time and electricity it
[SPEAKER_02]: requires to create the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that another way of saying what you're
saying, or are you saying that that 20
[SPEAKER_02]: plant sea green style is going to yield
that one plant, even with comparable
[SPEAKER_02]: canopies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would expect that the sea green
would always out-compete the bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thinking, too, is that with these
smaller plants, essentially, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating so much of that veg time that
you're spending labor to defoliate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're spending all this time growing
all this vegetative mass to just have
[SPEAKER_00]: labor going and strip it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it's like, well, why not just
skip all of that, start off with much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller plants and maximize your planting
density that way and improve your yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can achieve maybe a similar
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you're kind of getting at
is like a shoot density rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: planting density.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many shoots do you have throughout a
canopy area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buds, sites, flowers, flower sites,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very good way of thinking
about it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little more challenging
with bigger plants to get kind of a flat
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy across the top, very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can achieve that much easier with
a higher density of smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were all the cultivars fairly similar
in their response to this 10-hour photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did the genetics differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the responses were similar,
but they kind of shifted a little bit to
[SPEAKER_00]: left or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say the sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset really only flowered well at the
10-hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 11, the inner nodes became a lot more
elongated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers were really much less mature,
and they were not acceptable, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: for smoking quality by week eight of the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to 12, and 12 is like
borderline vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 13, 13 to 24 was all vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: With OG, it was flowering pretty well at
10, 11, and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little worse at 13, and then by 14,
it was basically vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiger was flowering 10 to 14 hours,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you got to 16 hours, it was
actually, it was still kind of developing
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of inflorescences along the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get out to 18, and it's
mostly vegetative after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the similarities between them,
I'd say, is the vegetative end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you provide an 18- to 24-hour photo
period, all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some differences in the
intermediate photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone would really use that
anyway, like 14 through 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some differences there with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the shorter photo periods
that you'd be shooting for flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a wider optimum with Tiger or OG,
but sunset really required that shortest
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're talking about greater
inner nodes spacing, more immature
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, what week are you looking at this
flower to kind of determine the maturity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we terminated every experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had a couple other experiments,
but all these photo period experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: we terminated the experimental week 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 56 days after we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one question I had just from
thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a cultivar that was flowering
faster at the 10-hour photo period,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe a little bit larger biomass at
the 12-hour photo period, at some point in
[SPEAKER_02]: time, I would expect those lines to cross
where potentially that 12-hour photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period could still be superior in just the
amount of increased yield that you may get
[SPEAKER_02]: due to the overall biomass production.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think from what we've seen from the
experiments, what we've done is that
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the 12-hour photo period,
the one I've worked with the most is
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very consistent and good variety to
work with and doesn't stretch too badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With OG, it was consistently better yields
at 12 hours as far as flower mass is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that comes with that is you
get a lot more trim as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could be getting more flower
mass, but if you're spending a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: labor to trim all that flower mass,
is that yield actually creating a benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: to you as a grower versus potentially
going with a shorter photo period that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to lose a little mass per
plant, but you're going to have a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: trim and a lot better quality of a flower
than you would at 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: And were you pruning or defoliating these
plants during the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the later experiments, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really kind of a minimum
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really only removing leaves that
were near the substrate line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our usual indication was if the leaf is
getting anything less than 50 micromoles,
[SPEAKER_00]: then just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really worth it to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that defoliation is tricky
because it adds a whole other variable to
[SPEAKER_02]: your experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a researcher who's not necessarily
looking to maximize yields, that just adds
[SPEAKER_02]: another variable that you have to account
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see why you wouldn't want to
necessarily remove stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would remove some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would do it consistently for all
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with growing in Clemson, where it's
very, very humid in the greenhouse all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, some issues with powdery mildew can
be pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so defoliating can help with some of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you see a difference in pester
pathogen pressure across these different
[SPEAKER_02]: photo periods?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like that wasn't really a
factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I'm thinking about is
botrytis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was inevitable with a lot of
our experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say off the top of my head,
but I will look back and see my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can let you know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say once you get to the 13-hour
photo period where they become a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more vegetative, they're kind of more in
that transition zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, yeah, they're very low risk of
having botrytis happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have really dense flowers,
which you would at 10, 11, and 12 with OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I think it was all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get why you would say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because botrytis likes flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to form within that bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants that area that's not getting a
lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, a real small microclimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I think of a plant
at 13, 14 hours that intermediate period
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be really stressed from all the
different hormonal responses it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: through as it's trying to go back into
pushing vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that would make it more
susceptible to pathogens as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of all the different
physiological changes it's trying to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with due to the photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant isn't necessarily trying to
revert back to vegetative, which we have
[SPEAKER_00]: done that as well, where we take plants
and we put them under a 12-hour photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period for five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put them back to long days,
like 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That for sure will stress the plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a 13-hour photo period, it's just
flowering much more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much more gradual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something like Sunset that really
wasn't flowering well at 11 or 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's partly because we harvest at week
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we just let that plant go to week
12, week 13, it probably would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not acceptable from a grower's
perspective to have a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_00]: requires 13 weeks to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one other question I wanted to ask you
about this experiment, too, was did you
[SPEAKER_02]: measure cannabinoids or terpenes and how
those might change based on photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with OG, that's the one we did the
most with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do see a very clear optimum with
these, that the 12-hour photo period for
[SPEAKER_00]: OG was the best and it wasn't even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids were lower at the 10,
and they got higher at 11, went higher at
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, but then really dropped down at 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from an extraction standpoint,
if you're doing these different photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period treatments, you can see which photo
period is clearly the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for flower, though,
of course, there's more considerations
[SPEAKER_00]: than just the cannabinoid percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, though, I'm just trying to think of
real-life applications for your
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like 12 hours is still the ideal
spot because of the diversity in cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: that we run in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like rarely do I talk to a grower who's
just growing all the same plant in one
[SPEAKER_02]: room and can really play with photo
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do you see as the real-life
application of this research, if any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I think especially for an
indoor grower or sole source lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have multiple rooms, that you can
break your varieties up into these
[SPEAKER_00]: different photo period responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like your sunset that only
flowers well at 10 hours or like an OG
[SPEAKER_00]: that flowers good between 10 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I'm sure there are
plenty of varieties like sunset that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily flower too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stretch really bad at 12 hours and
they're probably good genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they require a shorter photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can also play into your breeding
strategies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe some of these varieties that
don't necessarily flower well at 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe they have some other good
genetics to breed with and it just takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit shorter photo period to make it
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the other benefits is
the the electrical costs that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for sure that cannabis growers are
spending a ton of money running their
[SPEAKER_00]: lamps and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single minute those lamps are
running is costing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing as well is that
we saw with these shorter photo periods
[SPEAKER_00]: that your flower to trim ratio is just so
much higher than it is at a 12 hour photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can also cut down tremendously
on your post-harvest cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are all good points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would require.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm thinking about when you say
that this is one, most folks run multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, but maybe maybe those cultivars
can have similarities that could allow you
[SPEAKER_02]: to start experimenting with this on a
smaller scale and then maybe expand into a
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are advantages, like you
said, to less trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: After finish, it sounds like with some of
these plants and obviously the electrical
[SPEAKER_02]: savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing I find in commercial
indoor cannabis is that you end up having
[SPEAKER_02]: to switch out your cultivars quite a bit
based on market demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these hype cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like by the time you research one
and get it dialed in, I bet you're having
[SPEAKER_02]: to kick it to the curb for something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of cases, just to stay with the
market, which is frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I totally, I totally empathize
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's I think it's kind of
more of a short term problem right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the growers have to deal with
now to make the market work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that be the case for years to come?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of these generics are going
to get dialed in as clearly superior and
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that they'll be in your 711s,
your standard Southern OG and your
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the well researched
ones that are going to be mass marketed
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as trying to make new varieties
all the time, especially for more craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, I think it adds a challenge to
have to do all these cultivar evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a variety that might only stick
around for a few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it just has me thinking if a
breeder was able to come out with a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar that had like really good,
you know, a real good chemovar expression
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a 10 hour photo period or
something shorter that they could prove
[SPEAKER_02]: worked really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that being a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could see for sure that some of
these breeders, you know, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: a chemovar, I think that is hands down the
best way to classify these different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think eventually people are going to be
able to start patenting these different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and be able to mass market them
to different growers around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those regards, that's where you're
going to want these cultivar evaluations
[SPEAKER_00]: to show this is how it performs at 10
hours, 11 hours, 12 hours and different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many variables in genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know they've discovered the
certain genetic markers associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew now and resistance,
which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll find out there's ones
related to botrytis and other,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other major pathogens that could
make growing this plant a lot easier over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I appreciate the research that
you and others are doing to really push us
[SPEAKER_02]: forward in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very exploratory for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of more so the purpose
of us getting into the photo period was
[SPEAKER_00]: there was nothing done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Brian Whipker had done maybe one
study and that was really just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: whether plants stay vegetative at 16 and
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as kind of looking at where are
some of these opportunities that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: there with shorter, different photo
periods for flowering, that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground we wanted to break on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping some of this work that
gets out there will inspire more photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period research in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned this was sort of like your
initial study, but then you did some
[SPEAKER_02]: follow up work on this with some further
studies or experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were those and how did those sort of
either align with or maybe not align with
[SPEAKER_02]: the data you already had?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last photo period experiment that
we did, we did a 10, 11 and 12 hour photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period with OG, just those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was that, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the 10, 11, 12 hour photo periods
in the previous experiment, the DLI was
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this last one, the 11 hour photo
period would have the supplemental light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs run for another hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 12 hour photo period would have the
supplemental LEDs stay on for two more
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three treatments have different
DLIs and different photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little more difficult to
untangle whether this is a photo period or
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI response, but it's a more practical
way of looking at it because a grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to do it the way that we did our
first experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know a 10 hour photo period
plus 10 hours of DLI, how does that
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to a 12 hour photo period plus 12
hours DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found was that the results
were, I guess, almost self-fulfilling
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of course, as you increase your DLI,
that the mass increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found it again where at the 12 hour
photo period that the flowers were a
[SPEAKER_00]: little less developed than they were at
the 11 or 12 or the 10 or 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this wasn't an area basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't try to measure the plants and
get what is the yield on area basis for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours versus 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just again, more observational and
morphology based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the second experiment, just to make
just to clarify, you ran plants at 10
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, 11 hours and 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you rather than using a tiny light
bulb to extend the day length,
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually just let them get a full
amount of light for an extra hour or two
[SPEAKER_02]: versus that 10 hour baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you saw an overall increase in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant was bigger or produced more
leaves and flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you said it was less mature overall,
like the flowers weren't as finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers definitely were less
resonance, less frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigmas were a little bit more white
rather than orange and orange or brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting, though,
with this was that the flower to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, like how much flowers and how much
trim you had around those influences were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like with the earlier
experiments where we were just more so
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating the photoperiod response,
that there is a lot more mass,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, more leaf production,
more trim production, and the flowers were
[SPEAKER_00]: just smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this scenario, we're providing more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those flowers actually kind of got bigger
as well with the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our flower to trim was almost
identical from 10, 11 to 12, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it kind of aligns with the work by
Bruce Bugby in the sense that the more
[SPEAKER_02]: light you give a plant, being these are
highlight plants, just the more biomass it
[SPEAKER_02]: produces, it seems to be able to handle
light quite efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have any thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of what we started
transitioning to with the photoperiod
[SPEAKER_00]: research and the high control research was
trying to minimize trim because we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how much labor and money is
spent on trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that we can do in the
greenhouse while these plants are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: to minimize that part of the part of the
harvest is really what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find some value in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say the plants were less
mature, are we still talking about like
[SPEAKER_02]: day 55, 56 range for harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right at the end of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did find that the cannabinoids
were, again, the highest at 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't too much higher this time
with the strictly photoperiod one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was clearly better at 12 hours,
which would indicate that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something about the 12-hour photoperiod
itself, regardless of the DLI,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's stimulating a higher cannabinoid
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this experiment, it wasn't as much of
a difference between the 10, 11 and 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you could see a pretty similar trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that this is probably a more
insoteric question, but do you think this
[SPEAKER_02]: just relates more to the way these plants
have been bred and cultivated by humans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the last decade, centuries to flower
optimally at 12 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think this is something that
relates back to the genetics of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think it depends on where the
varieties are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's the traditional,
what people consider the sativas are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that originated from more like
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the indicas are supposedly
originating from the Hindu Kush areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the Hindu areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always called Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it depends on where the
photoperiods that they're exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally when they were first evolving by
themselves, and then how we bred them
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we were mixing them back and
forth, so it definitely will depend on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is trying to go back in time
and say, okay, well, what lineage did this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar come from to understand what the
photoperiod optimum might be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a chance we could eventually
discover there's genetic markers related
[SPEAKER_02]: to photoperiod that we might be able to
identify and then know how a plant would
[SPEAKER_02]: be optimally grown from a light
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think genetic work can find out
basically anything related to physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I'm thinking is that some
of these differences are just a classic
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf perceives the photoperiod,
it creates a stimulus, it translocates
[SPEAKER_00]: that stimulus from the leaf to the shoot
apex, and then that stimulus elicits a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the meristem from vegetative
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just part of the flower initiation
process of just making a reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there can be all sorts of
genetic components right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you think about the development of
the cannabinoids and the actual appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the amount that the plant
stretches and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, of course, all these things are
going to be genetically regulated and
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be some serious opportunity to
manipulate every step of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything else related to this
research or other photoperiod research
[SPEAKER_02]: that you wanted to talk about before we
move on to some of your other work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one other thing that we really saw was
interesting was with sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with sunset really only flowering
well at the 10-hour photoperiod,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we also saw is that every time we
would flower sunset at this 10-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod, the leaves would always get
really, really purple, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate that phosphorus is being
mobilized from the leaves up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned with Bruce before him and
his graduate student, Mitch Westmoreland,
[SPEAKER_00]: they put out the phosphorus paper a couple
of years ago showing that essentially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting more than 30 ppm of
phosphorus on your plants, you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that they were showing
is that this response of mobilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus from the older parts of the
plant into the growing flowers is a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: common response to a lot of other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forgetting them off the top of my
head, but he has them in the publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really only saw that with sunset or if
you have it at the shortest photo period,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are getting what looks like
phosphorus deficiency in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that tells you is that perhaps this
is the strongest flowering stimulus and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what's causing the plant to move
phosphorus from the leaves to the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: much more aggressively than it does at a
longer photoperiod like 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one part of just looking at the
flowers of saying, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe these are more compact or more or
less frosty, but then also just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves themselves and seeing how
they're behaving because they're all in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same fertilizer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why a 10-hour
photoperiod should be any less healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: than a 12-hour photoperiod with the same
fertilizer program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm just processing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I would have expected to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to reiterate, you're saying at a
shorter DOI, 10-hour photoperiod,
[SPEAKER_02]: you saw phosphorus deficiencies being
demonstrated on the plant in the form of
[SPEAKER_02]: purple stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That relates to the plant trying to grow
or essentially growing flowers or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves and that thing faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves would get what looks like
phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Mitch and Bruce have hypothesized is
that the plants are doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mobilizing phosphorus from the
leaves to the flowers in order to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus to make phytic acid,
which is an energy source for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, that's redundant in
cannabis cultivation because we're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: unpolymated plants, but it is interesting
to observe that what the plant can do at
[SPEAKER_00]: the shorter photoperiod because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, if a plant is having a 10-hour
photoperiod, the plants are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh shit, winter is right around the corner
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a flower as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-hour, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still got time to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is almost like a crop steering
approach here where you're creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario that forces intentional plant
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unintentional in this case, but
potentially an intentional response from
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing that you did have a noted
phosphorus deficiency, how did that impact
[SPEAKER_02]: the final flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers at the 10-hour photoperiod
were much smaller for sure, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: dense clusters, which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very frosty and dense clusters,
but way, way smaller than the 12-hour
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trade-off though with the 12-hour
photoperiod that the stigmas were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much all white and really underdeveloped,
but that's a more unique case with sunset
[SPEAKER_00]: that it doesn't flower well at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's other genetics out there
that you could probably see some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: natural phosphorus deficiencies,
which that doesn't mean you need to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: dump a bunch of phosphorus on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means your plants are flowering as they
should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've associated purpling with genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some genetics just seem to express that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to correct me on any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: With your own experiences, cold
temperatures will obviously limit
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus mobility in the plants,
but you rarely see that in indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other thing is, what about a man
of blanking on the term, the purpling due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it wouldn't apply,
but high-intensity lighting creates it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain's just not working right now,
but you see it with like tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, that purple color.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a term for it and I had it five
minutes ago, but I can't think of it right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mentioned talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the term either,
but I feel like I know what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an antioxidant, but that's another
thing that essentially coats the leaf as a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant response, as a way of protecting the
leaf due to the highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for blanking on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, those are all things I associate
in my head with purpling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have anything to add
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're saying is essentially that
this deficiency that you're seeing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the purple stems is not necessarily a
negative thing and that the plant's really
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly trying to complete its life cycle,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really would only start happening I
think about week six, so about two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before we harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that point, all the vegetative mass is
done growing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's going to be mobilizing
everything from the older growth into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Bruce and Mitch will have some
data in the coming months to show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they show I think something like 30%
of the total photosynthetic capacity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is coming directly from those
flowers, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the flowers and the
inflorescences are surrounded by all these
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny bracts and those are all capable of
doing photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To put this in growers' terms,
your sugar leaves are photosynthesizing
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they're covered in trichomes
and they're actually producing a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant amount of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually makes sense to me because
you hear about these methods where people
[SPEAKER_02]: are removing the vast majority of fan
leaves, yet the plants are still yielding
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well or even better in some cases,
so they had to be photosynthesizing from
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really cool to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures like that where the
whole plant is defoliated, but they still
[SPEAKER_00]: have massive flowers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how the heck is that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Noreet Bernstein did a study like this a
couple of years ago where she had
[SPEAKER_00]: different pruning treatments for her
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found that the yields were lower,
of course, when you remove the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the ones that were not
defoliated and such, but the yields were
[SPEAKER_00]: still pretty high on ones that she
aggressively defoliated to so much so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was basically just the inflorescences
along the plant shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd love to see more research around
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to try and get a hold of...
I've seen that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if it's a man or a
woman, but Noreet Bernstein, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I pronouncing it correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Noreet Bernstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's a wonderful researcher in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Met her a few times now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure she would be happy to be on this,
but she's done some tremendous studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just search her name on Google
Scholar, a bunch of studies will pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I read a paper and emailed her
about it regarding mycorrhizal fungi and
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metal uptake that I think she might
have done years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that was her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's some amazing researchers
and more research coming out all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really actually hard to keep up at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my stack... I mean, that's why I...
Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love this industry is because
there's so few crops that we can still do
[SPEAKER_02]: research on that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least to me, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what was so exciting too about
getting started with this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research was that with poinsettias,
people were doing poinsettia research for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the stuff has been worked out
already, except maybe heat delay,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was what my whole master's project
was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, just anything you do in
a formal experiment is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new and everybody wants to see
well, how did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not anything unique to any
other plants, but you want to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that it happens as well with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I see growers trying things all
the time that are interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you go back far enough and you'll
see people dumping Kool-Aid on their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see people pouring ice cubes on their
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you name it, cannabis growers have
tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shove their soil in an oven to
sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a creative, innovative bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all that works, but they'll try
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as scientific inquiry, I think
cannabis growers have a remarkable edge
[SPEAKER_00]: because they do come up with some wild
scenarios of things to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of science is just seeing
what works and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess part of it is just having
something more formal and something
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ideas are there to pursue new
avenues, explore the unexplored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of topics that I would love to
see more research on because I've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: growers starting to experiment with them
are jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're very familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've seen more stuff just on
social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any research around it,
but some research would be good just to
[SPEAKER_02]: either disprove it or actually show some
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the electroculture stuff that people
are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electroculture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially running a low level of
electricity through your soil as a way of
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow increasing plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are doing it in their gardens and
I've even seen some cannabis growers doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any research to support it,
but I also haven't really dug into it at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of stuff around
alkaline water that's been pretty world
[SPEAKER_02]: debunked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no idea where the idea would
be coming from, but would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a new idea to pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find funding for it,
then go at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get back to some actual
research stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other experiments or projects have
you been working on beyond photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dissertation will have four chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is growth analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these plants change over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is flushing, which we did a
pretty hefty amount of research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fourth is high control.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we stop this crazy flowering
stretch that happens after you start short
[SPEAKER_00]: days?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go from plant that's a foot tall to
three feet tall within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you curve that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stretching flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What variables impact beyond genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we control from that stretch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ideally, we want that stretch to
be smaller so we don't have to use as much
[SPEAKER_02]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to keep our internodal spacing
as small as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, what did you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole idea is called height
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, if you think about it,
managing the height of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really managing the internode
space of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so me and my best friend, George
Grant, he's the technical services manager
[SPEAKER_00]: now with Griffin Greenhouse Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I are writing an article,
and with Jim Faust, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, on non-chemical height control
methods for cannabis growers, which I sent
[SPEAKER_00]: over to Michelle Samakis yesterday at
Canvas Business Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be coming out in a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first part that we'll talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one thing that we say in
there is you want to control height in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pick genetics that don't
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, as you mentioned that the
market sometimes demands certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, so you don't have the option to
not grow that really stretchy cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a number of other options
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like with poinsettias or other
ornamentals is one is controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: diff, the difference between your day and
night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: With poinsettias, if you run a warmer
night temperature than a day temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually create much shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is, this one's always a
mouthful to say, is thymomorphogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you actually touch your
plants and this causes them to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what some growers have
demonstrated, I can't remember what crop
[SPEAKER_00]: this was with, but basically if they just
vibrate the table, the bench tables a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit just to create a little bit of
wiggle in the plants, it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay a lot shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we wanted to find with this
research was, I guess, maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative ways to control some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one that was kind of obvious
was pinching, topping your plants at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of your short days to just
physically remove some of that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some growers, they don't pinch at
the start of short days or even after
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they do it for the last time a few
weeks before starting short days,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they result in these huge shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the one aspect that we tested
was, what is the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: pinching your plant, let's say a week
before you start short days, pinching it
[SPEAKER_00]: at the start of short days, and then
pinching it a week after starting short
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other technique we wanted to try,
and I guess I haven't really come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: a good term for this, one that rolls off
the tongue a little easier, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it fertilizer restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really the same idea of flushing,
but it's flushing the plants at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that basically you cut off
fertilizer when you start the short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of short days, the plant is
getting the signal, the physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: signal to stretch because of the short
photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you put the plant into a starved
state that can't stretch because it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have the nutrients and the energy
to do so, then you can keep the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once the stretching period is over,
usually by week two or week three of short
[SPEAKER_00]: days, then go ahead and resume all your
fertilizer and the plants are good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height, I guess, management that way
is permanent too, so the plants won't
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch like crazy once you give them
fertilizer again.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of questions, but let's start with
the fertilizer one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, I want to say this only
works for people growing with mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: salts, chemical growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're growing in living soil or
organics, you don't have that level of
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't try it with organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that would be my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to contradict me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the fertilizer restriction though,
are you seeing any plant deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a greater stress response through
this restriction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look like they're on the verge
of death when you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fertilizer restriction treatments
that we had were zero, one, and two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after starting short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is that the plants
with one and two-week fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction, the leaves would get really
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would clearly be smaller and
just overall stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the one-week fertilizer
restriction, we're just doing it from day
[SPEAKER_00]: zero to day seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we give plants fertilizer again till
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week two, where that two-week
fertilizer restriction treatment is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bottom leaves are actually
falling off and up-sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one-week fertilizer restriction
looks totally healthy a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also that two-week fertilizer
restriction by week three looks totally
[SPEAKER_00]: good and looks totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you measure yields at the end to see
how that was impacted by this stress
[SPEAKER_02]: event?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we've really gotten into the
idea of planting density with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer restriction causes a
permanent stunting of the plant as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the length by width dimensions of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was we measured the yields on
all of them, but we also measured the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual dimensions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was that the longer you
apply fertilizer restriction for,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller the plants get to lower the
yields on a per-plant basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put that on a per-area basis,
then the yields are actually significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that requires then is that you're
growing more plants per meter square,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the yields are tremendously higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I have a lot of other
questions around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting back to your touching one though,
you're going to have a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_02]: running through their rooms touching their
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you receive the same physiological
response by just having a stand that's
[SPEAKER_02]: moving the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're getting the plants to move
back and forth a little bit, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: would work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method that I think they do with
basil, I want to say, is that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little brush motor that goes over the
plant as it just goes down the bench just
[SPEAKER_00]: to touch the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another good stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps sometimes kick up some insects
as well and get them trapped on sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see that video that in
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up Shenandoah growers,
I think they're in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have all sorts of videos
online you could see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from a landscaping background.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents own a nursery landscaping
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know from planting trees that the
way we stake them, we want that tree to
[SPEAKER_02]: move around a little bit because it
creates a better root mass and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: has better root structure and is a
healthier tree that won't require as much
[SPEAKER_02]: staking if we plant it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see how this would correlate with
what you're doing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you baby the plant and it has no
stimulus in terms of movement back and
[SPEAKER_02]: forth on the stem itself, you don't have
quite as robust of a foundation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots to support the plant because it
doesn't put energy into it because it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't need it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think having a little bit of mechanical
stress in that way is very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial, especially because some of the
growers are using trellis netting,
[SPEAKER_00]: which to me is such a pain to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my experiments were geared
towards how do we eliminate trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of this higher air movement
is one way for sure that you could add
[SPEAKER_00]: some benefit that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go back and look because I know
there's an optimal amount of airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: across the leaf surface according to Dr.
Nadiya Saba, the Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're familiar with her research,
she's probably the top airflow HVAC expert
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry, especially with cannabis
and ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that she talks about is
how, and you're probably aware of this
[SPEAKER_02]: with calcium especially, but if you get
too much airflow across the leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's not able to transpire fast
enough and so you'll get calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies expressed in the leaf or leaf
tit burn, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a balance there between too much
airflow and then enough airflow for gas
[SPEAKER_02]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like anything else, there's an
optimal range there that people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure they're hitting so you're not
just blasting your plant with air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting to me because
especially with transpiration that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have stagnant air, it creates a
microclimate right underneath that leaf at
[SPEAKER_00]: the subsamal cavity between the stomata
and the outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are constantly running air,
then you don't have any human
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates right around that stomata so
there should always be a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient between the leaf and the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thinking would be at a higher air
movement that you would have more
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do, but at some point the plant can't
transpire fast enough to keep up with that
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you see what people call wind
burn or leaf tit burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder, I guess, how fast is that wind
going because that could be some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things and also the temperature too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're blowing so much air,
it's going to cool off some of these areas
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is taken up passively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to move with water and so if you're
having low water movement, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's going through the
xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to recap, you're saying the ways we
can control height are fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: restriction, first couple of weeks of
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a chemical grower, we can
control it through topping or pinching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume training the plant down
into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just breaking that oxen pathway to
the plant similar to pinching,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would work too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then mechanically moving the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those the three main ways?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I miss one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant spacing is one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have plants really crowded
together, the environment will become far
[SPEAKER_00]: red enriched and far red light will
stimulate stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually kind of reminds me too,
with Bruce's research, he has clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: shown that far red photons drive
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he and I have talked about a couple
of times is that with far red light,
[SPEAKER_00]: although you can drive more photosynthesis
in certain cultivars, far red light will
[SPEAKER_00]: promote stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe far red light isn't always
appropriate to add to your LEDs if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing varieties that tend to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know there's been more research
around far red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not as up to date on the lighting
research as I want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know that there's some folks that
claim HPS still produces a superior flower
[SPEAKER_02]: due to either A, the heat leaf surface
that you get from HPS that you don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: with LED or that you have more red in the
spectrum itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just like the expression that
they get off of that better than they do
[SPEAKER_02]: off of a full spectrum LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if you have any thoughts
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for sure that if you're using an
HPS that's super overdrive with red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, yes, you will basically eliminate
or you'll create a very high red to far
[SPEAKER_00]: red ratio, which will help negate some
stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other thing too is at least
traditionally the HPS lighting is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: very high light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another factor is that the
lower the light intensity, the more the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is going to stretch because it's
trying to capture as many photons as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're providing a really, really high
light intensity, then plant has no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so another way we could potentially
control it then you're saying is
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing the light intensity,
the PAR levels, PPFD canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's challenging too, because the
plants will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ideally what you could do is have
it almost like with blinds where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a chain where you can lower and raise
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ideally, as the plant is growing
every week, you can just slightly raise
[SPEAKER_00]: the lamps a little bit just so that the
flowers aren't too close to lamps and not
[SPEAKER_00]: burning them or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would really be a tremendous way
to control height was being able to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: your lamps on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a significant engineering
project right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I've talked to a grower on
scale and he's like, it's $4,000 every
[SPEAKER_02]: time I want to raise or lower my lights,
like it's because of the amount of labor
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a home grower, it's quite easy to
do, though I will admit like I have LED
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're very high quality LED lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I allowed the plants to grow too close
to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I ended up with some issues on the
leaf itself just from the plant not being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to, just receiving too, what I would
classify as too much light relative to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility in the soil and the environment
that it was in CO2, everything else in a
[SPEAKER_02]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know Bruce has done research that
shows that the plants can handle
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly higher levels of light than
we ever thought possible, cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, which I thought was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they correct me again on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I understand of his
research, at least his old research was
[SPEAKER_02]: that spectrum was much less important than
light intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting higher light levels had a
greater impact on yield, gambling
[SPEAKER_02]: expression, all that than what spectrum
you're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's interesting too with the
spectrum is that with other research has
[SPEAKER_00]: shown that if you provide a lot of blue
light, it'll keep the plants a lot shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really only under low light
conditions with certain crops like salvia,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're only growing them at maybe
five to 10 moles of light per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can start to make some of these
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, where you're trying to
get 60, 80, even 100 moles per day of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, the light quality is much less
important for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get much more benefit out of
increasing the PPFD or DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw you a curve ball here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I was thinking about the
other day, I posted this on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a wide variety of responses and I
want to hear your thoughts about cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with what I'm talking
about when I say that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this sort of 45 degree angle,
a leaf angle that you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has always been associated with a
very happy plant, you're getting good,
[SPEAKER_02]: a turgidity in the stem apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the thoughts I was having
as I was in my room looking at this and
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plants were getting way too much
light at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weren't perfectly happy in my
opinion, but yet they were doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: praying motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this is a less than optimal
angle for receiving photons too,
[SPEAKER_02]: versus having them be completely flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts about it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgetting the term is, but to me,
that would be because there's not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the plant is doing is it's
trying to raise up or expose more so the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom surface of the leaf to get those
stomata exposed and get more airflow and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate some of that, the humidity
that's sticking right around the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I would think that it's
caused by not enough airflow going through
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another way to think about is the VPD
isn't high enough, either too much
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically the plant's not transpiring
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to raise the leaves, expose the
stomata more so to the airflow to help
[SPEAKER_00]: drive a higher transpiration gradient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone did talk about that in relation
to, yeah, the stomata and CO2 potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: playing a role in that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly enough, and when you say
that and I'm thinking about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have under canopy airflow in the room
and all my lower leaves look fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the top of my canopy where there is
less airflow, I am seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have to experiment with
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate you sharing your
knowledge on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's too is that as the plant
develops, Mitch has some really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: photos of this, is that what they did was
take some thermal imaging of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the flowers are so
much hotter than the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that kind of contributes to what I
think is the issue with some botrytis with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is that the flowers are
transpiring less as the time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they're transpiring less,
they're not moving as much calcium into
[SPEAKER_00]: those inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know calcium is what helps prevent
botrytis infection in a number of other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could imagine that with the top of
the canopy where there's not as much
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow, it's also much hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant's trying to transpire to
maintain its physiological balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where you have more airflow at the
bottom, where it's cooler and not as
[SPEAKER_00]: bright, the leaves probably look fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You described it exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to calcium, though,
I can't remember if you said it on air or
[SPEAKER_02]: not because we talked a little bit
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you talked about spraying calcium and
how that wasn't as effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you say what you already said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab mate, Melissa Munoz,
she did her doctorate work with calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and different pesticide sprays for
preventing botrytis on rose, I think herb
[SPEAKER_00]: or daisy and something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what she found is that if you spray
calcium onto the flower tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can help reduce botrytis infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to try that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue was that by the time you were
spraying it, by the time you actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: these well-developed inflorescences and
they're kind of in that time where
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis can start infecting and becoming
a problem, it's too late to be applying
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really get it into the flowers
like you can with a rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you do it with a rose is that
you just turn it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dunk it into a solution of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with a cannabis plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea instead is that what we
need to do is that you can't really spray
[SPEAKER_00]: late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to be doing is providing
higher calcium and potentially silica
[SPEAKER_00]: right from the start of flowering or even
beforehand and maintain very, very high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of calcium and silica in
the plant to potentially reduce botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have data for that or anything,
but what we know for sure is that spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: either pesticides or calcium late into
flowering does nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying raise the levels of
fertility in terms of calcium and silica
[SPEAKER_02]: in your media ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we talked about last night
already is calcium silicate is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that you use in your experiment and
it's a very affordable, easy thing to just
[SPEAKER_02]: add in your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using it with all of our soil
recommendations now instead of more
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional agricultural lime,
oyster shell flower, things like that as a
[SPEAKER_02]: way of, it doesn't move the needle on pH
up quite as much, but it does allow us to
[SPEAKER_02]: get more calcium silica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very affordably into the media.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica really goes a long way with
eliminating powdery mildew and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you really need to apply
that much into the substrate or you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to mix that much in,
but just a little bit will go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably for a large scale
grower, it's more practical to just mix it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the substrate or potentially do a
trench, but for the home grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can just take your standard
substrate or meter that you're using and
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a handful of your last night and
just kind of mix it in and fill your pots
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that kind of covered the research
that I'm aware of that you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there other research or information
that you want to share with growers or we
[SPEAKER_02]: can always do another podcast here down
the road when you have more information to
[SPEAKER_02]: share?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a number of flushing experiments
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the interest with flushing is that
there's a lot of canvas growers using
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very expensive fertilizers,
the Athena ag nutrients, the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: have cute labels on them and stuff that
they aren't any different than going down
[SPEAKER_00]: to your local farm store and buying the
salts yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's anything I can say on air to
audiences, please, if you are buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is only sold to canvas
growers, please stop buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting your money completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go buy any other product that's
used to grow other crops and use it on
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas and it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of one of the biggest,
I think, benefits with flushing though is
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers that are on it, they're
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, shit, I can cut out one
or two weeks of fertilizer, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial cost and then still get a
pretty good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from the experiments that we've
done that flushing one to two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get to about two weeks of
flushing, you do start negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not too bad of a loss in that
there's also some potential increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoking quality that we never got to
do because human clinical trials are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly regulated, especially with the
university and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one area that I think the
flushing research, at least from the
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that we've done, we've shown
pretty well how it affects the flower mass
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the smoking quality is really just
that is the big mystery right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a huge area for future
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say flushing, let's just
clarify for, well, one thing I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: clarify is yes, you can actually look to
traditional ag or other ag resources for
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, especially on the chemical
side, mineral salt side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be aware that you still have to be
cautious of heavy metal content and they
[SPEAKER_02]: may not be as clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the regulatory bodies of your
state, they may have higher levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: arsenic lead, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could raise the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something I think people need to
be cautious of with wherever they source
[SPEAKER_02]: their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I totally agree with you that the
cannabis industry is rife with marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: and hype that they're overpaying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphoric acid is phosphoric acid,
nitrates are nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant cannot tell the difference
whether there was a fancy label on the
[SPEAKER_02]: product or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I want to just highlight that
because that was a really good point you
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting back to the flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're talking about flushing,
you're talking about growing with mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: salts, chemicals in Rockwell or Cocoa or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then running water through it to
remove any nutrients, any ionic salts from
[SPEAKER_02]: the media as a way of crop steering or
creating a plant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew all of our plants in peat-based
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, how we would apply our
flushing treatments is that we would put
[SPEAKER_00]: tripometers into the top of the substrate,
pass clear water, usually about 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: liters was enough to drop the EC down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you pass the water through until you
get a low substrate EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is removing all the mineral
nutrients from the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is really only getting
exposed to water, just water to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: alive until you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water in Clemson, water is fairly pure
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say pure, it means no calcium,
magnesium and other things are naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that depends on the area that you're
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the base idea is remove all the
nutrients from the substrate and let the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant finish with just whatever is already
inside of its plant body.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you doing at the end of the
flowering cycle then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did up to four weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we always harvest that week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means for our four-week
treatment, that's half the plant life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle is without fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And surprisingly, the ones that were
flushed for four weeks, the flowers look
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trim, the bracts all around the
flower are really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were lower for sure,
but the bracts in the trim were much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers were much more round and
actually looked like a fairly nice
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just your yields were garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were significantly lower than they
were with the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found is now our flush is very
aggressive where you are pouring water
[SPEAKER_00]: through the substrate and removing
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers just switch to clear water so
that way there's still some nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate as they progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were removing everything when we
started the flushing treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even with that aggressive of a
flush, the one-week flush didn't infect
[SPEAKER_00]: yield at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a number of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the two-week flush... Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the one-week yield have any impact
whatsoever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it not help?
[SPEAKER_00]: No impacts versus... No impact at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between that and the control, which was
given fertilizer the whole time,
[SPEAKER_00]: no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which might also tell you that by week
seven of flowering that the plant's really
[SPEAKER_00]: insensitive to changes in the substrate in
that last week of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based off your research, no one should
be fertilizing last week if you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: with chemical mineral salts because you're
just wasting nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some potential too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always for trying to minimize any
input because every input costs more
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always trying to cut costs of crop
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was only with the one variety,
but I think there's some substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit that if you're looking to cut back
on what your inputs are, a one-week flush
[SPEAKER_00]: should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to promise anything
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something though I think that people
should look into.
[SPEAKER_02]: A week of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are already trying
to do this at least a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's something people should
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened when you moved it out to
two weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it was a statistical
difference, where it was statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: worse than the zero or one-week flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's interesting too is that if you
combine flushing with fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction, there's actually a
substantial amount of fertilizer you can
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out from each crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do one week of fertilizer
restriction at the start and then one week
[SPEAKER_00]: flush at the end, well then really you're
only providing fertilizer for six weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps you curtail some of the
stretch at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps you potentially improve the
smoking quality and all the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: campus growers seem to believe that does,
which I have no data to say one way or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other, but sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're flushing mid-cycle,
you're not removing any nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nutrients are not flowing back out of
the roots or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you are doing is reducing the
amount of further nutrient uptake,
[SPEAKER_02]: which people may say excessive nitrates
could cause a harsher finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I typically hear it associated with
nitrates, but I suppose it could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially apply to other minerals as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard amides as well, which is a
nitrogen-based compound as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I believe creates a more grassy smell
in some other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's potentially another reason
to get rid of nitrogen as you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the end of the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, Jim, and Allison Justice, we had
written a flushing article last year on
[SPEAKER_00]: just what might be some of the
applications of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of crops, you see that high
nitrogen, especially later in flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: increases pest susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be another reason as well to
get rid of a little bit of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just helping with a little bit of
pest pressure that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you look at just removing nitrogen in
terms of, rather than flushing everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: just flushing nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not formally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be published, but I did some side
experiments with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was I removed just nitrogen,
just phosphorus, the combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and phosphorus, and then all the
nutrients, and then also out of control
[SPEAKER_00]: that we gave everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because phosphorus is also associated with
stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it seemed like was if you
remove the nitrogen or phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it does help curtail some of the
growth, but not as much as if you remove
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, with the fertilizer restriction,
the best way to go about it would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove nitrogen and phosphorus for just
that first or second week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no reason to cut off things
like potassium, calcium, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you get rid of all those?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my experiments, it was just easier
to just go no fertilizer or fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in a perfect world, I think
keeping potassium in there, it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: critical for so many flowering development
functions related to yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be as simple as something
like potassium sulfate, gypsum,
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sorts of things would still allow
you to keep those cations coming in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not eliminating nitrogen and
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a recent study that's showing
that a lot of the terpenes or the aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: that we desire with cannabis are largely
linked to the sulfur-based compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where it's like with
flushing, it's like, well, are you sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to eliminate everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because potentially providing a little
sulfur at the end of the cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's helpful for bringing out some
of that skunky rotten eggs and burnt mats
[SPEAKER_00]: smell that we all love with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to give you a little background,
I know you hadn't heard of the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: when you came on, which I truly appreciate
you doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my background and our company's
background is really around what people
[SPEAKER_02]: are calling living soil these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This idea of organic media that's full of
nutrients ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very biologically active.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're doing less nutrient
management and feeding during the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have a lot of these tools that
you're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of giving the plant everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my head, I'm trying to think how
some of these things might apply to the
[SPEAKER_02]: style of growing that we like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the things you talked about
is sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's ways to reuse our media and not
have to move media in and out of facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can have a lot of labor savings,
but it also brings in a lot of pest and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen risk and risk around your crop if
you're not managing your fertility
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to give you a little
background because I'm approaching it from
[SPEAKER_02]: an entirely different perspective as you
are where you're able to target every
[SPEAKER_02]: single thing and you're using mineral
salts to really dial it all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's been one of the biggest
counter arguments that I've heard with
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing, supposedly improving the smoking
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've all heard for years that the
outdoor organic cannabis is the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and they don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does that come through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that only with maybe soil source
lighting environments or chemical-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers are you getting this benefit
that you don't with organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good future study as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a
preference in the market towards living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil flower, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is just because there's
so many people growing with Athena.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, do you want the same old
expression, the same thing that everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: else is providing, whereas living soil
gives you... I think that biological
[SPEAKER_02]: component adds something that we can't
quite reproduce fully with chemicals,
[SPEAKER_02]: just that nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not forcing ionic salts into
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's controlling that process a lot
more through the biological interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rhizosphere that I think could lead
to a unique cannabinoid and turpentine
[SPEAKER_02]: expression versus just using the same
essential minerals that you get in a salt
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's a good point that you
brought up because we really don't flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a field grower, of course,
too, how are you going to flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only possible if you're growing in
containers inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did just make a video on flushing
because in the organic soil, the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, when I talk about flushing,
what I'm talking about is after the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's out of the soil or it's truly
soilless media, but out of living soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: we may want to flush the media to lower
sodium and chlorides, but we're not doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it mid-cycle as a way of crop steering or
stressing the plant or removing nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so much nutrients in the
soil that we can't flush out mid-cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: like you could with what you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I have not done anything with
the living soil aspect, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's going to be a ton of
research opportunities for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's something I'm less optimistic
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a lot of interest coming
from researchers regarding organic
[SPEAKER_02]: production, and I totally get it because
it's so hard to control for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: variables when we add in biology and we
add in that natural nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_02]: process that I think it would be really
hard to get replicable data unless we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to just go with a very broad conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's compost is different,
so any research around that is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: super variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's really challenging,
and I understand why researchers wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to put their name on it versus
something where they can dial everything
[SPEAKER_02]: in exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's a little easier to fund
the greenhouse research we're doing now
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can specifically manipulate
individual variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I think the long-term market
with cannabis is that, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be the big growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a Marlboro one day for
cannabis that's selling cannabis in every
[SPEAKER_00]: state for as low cost as possible,
but there's also going to be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving craft business just like there is
with beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your Bud Lights, you have your
Budweiser and Miller Lights and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk, and then you have all these other
breweries and businesses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available as well that are providing a
much higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you get enough of them
together, a certain area like California
[SPEAKER_00]: or Oregon, enough organic growers and
potentially they could do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think in the short term,
it's definitely a little more challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: to put that research together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the big corporate cannabis
companies are failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: MedMen just totally failed recently,
and I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are finding there's a lot
more to growing this crop on scale than
[SPEAKER_02]: they realized, and I think there's also
like you said, there is more demand in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market for graft flour still, but I think
our market is still maturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we will see in legalization,
you never really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't try to guess at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not surprising to see a company
like MedMen fail because there's companies
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that have no regard for what it
costs to grow a crop, and that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: my advisor has drilled into my head from
the day I started graduate research is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have to be focused on every
aspect of the cost for growing any plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you are ignoring that, the labor,
the trimming and the substrate fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything, you're setting yourself up
for failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree with you,
and I do agree that the cost of production
[SPEAKER_02]: has to come down because the value of the
crop is coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we produce, the less it's worth,
and the less it's worth, the more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient you have to be as a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm in Washington state where
we've had legal recreational cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the longest running states now in
the country, and so our market is much
[SPEAKER_02]: more mature than some of these other newly
established markets, and that's what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen is that you have to be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who are surviving are the ones
that are either producing top-quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis relatively affordably,
or they're just pumping it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can go to the dispensary and get
$60 ounces of pretty low-quality product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some people just, that's what they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of have to fall into one of
those two camps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a race to the bottom that's happening
now in any state, and it's a race to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that's happened with every other
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poinsettias, a grower might make a couple
of pennies per plant, and really,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times, poinsettias are only grown
just so they can keep their labor employed
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of the year because they make
more of their money on the bedding and
[SPEAKER_00]: spring plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm good friends with Suzanne
Wingrite Evans, bug lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're familiar with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an amazing entomologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: She talks about that, and it blows my mind
that the difference is pennies,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so from her perspective on the
entomology side, they have to be so dialed
[SPEAKER_02]: in with their IPM program because we are
talking pennies per plant that if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing something, you need to pay attention
because there's a reason behind it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot to be learned,
I think, in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: From other growers, it's as simple as just
go take a tour at a Metrolina kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: facility where they're growing plants at
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a few hundred acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the techniques and practices that
they're using is what the cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_00]: will for sure need to adapt to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, I really appreciate your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to follow up with you down
the road with more research as it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: available, and I'd love to promote and
share what you're doing as your research
[SPEAKER_02]: is published.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just took a job out here in
Oregon, so I'm happy to be living out here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the West Coast now, working with a
smaller cannabis grower who also values
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting every single class across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't care about me signing an NDA or
anything like that, so I'll be sure to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing a lot more of our research
projects coming up here.
