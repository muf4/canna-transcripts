[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, I wanted to
let listeners know that I plan on adding
[SPEAKER_00]: more interviews of growers this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the original intention of the
podcast was to bridge the gap between
[SPEAKER_00]: academic research and real-life
cultivation, I've done a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews over the years and I think it's
important to hear how growers are dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with real, day-to-day issues in their
cultivation facilities, as we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: typically get to grow under perfect
conditions and control for every variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these interviews might be
slightly less scientific and may contain
[SPEAKER_00]: some personal experiences and anecdotal
information, my hope is that it will spark
[SPEAKER_00]: new ideas, research, and help growers deal
with real-life scenarios that they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: facing as well and grow the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spirit of this, my guest this week
is Matthew Butters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Matthew when he emailed me and we
started corresponding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to tour his facility, which is
about two and a half hours away from me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and after the tour, I decided I wanted to
have him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew serves as the Director of
Cultivation at Smokey Point Productions
[SPEAKER_00]: and Waypoint Ventures, a prominent I-502
operation in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leveraging his expertise in cannabis
cultivation, he has a rich history of
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully developing and leading
cultivation teams in various settings
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew is driven by a commitment to
achieving sustainable production of
[SPEAKER_00]: top-tier cannabis on a commercial scale,
reflecting his passion for excellence in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Matthew, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tad, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a true honor to be on your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough good things and how
much I've learned from just listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and your esteemed guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met you recently in person at Smokey
Point Productions, your current facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give us a quick background
about sort of who you are and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started out as a home grower,
jumped around from grow to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: just learning as much as I could from each
one, being a sponge, absorbing as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: I can from each and every, you know,
mentor or colleague that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up here at Smokey Point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't be more thankful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing company to work for and
yeah, excellent opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it might be interesting for
growers because some of my most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts are ones where we're talking to
actual growers and that's who people want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions that I had was,
as you started your sort of experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, let's kind of go back to
where you started and maybe a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you learned kind of each stop along
the way so someone could kind of have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To become the head grower of a pretty
large facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started just humble beginnings as a
home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had a very intimate relationship
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped me on my personal journey
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started growing plants at my
house and dove into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really, you know, people
putting out information just like
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know one of your guests,
Jeff Lohenfels, he really sparked my
[SPEAKER_01]: interest for organic cultivation with
Teaming with Microbes and that series.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just reading every, you know,
little tidbit or every book that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to suck up all the knowledge
that I could and then test it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in real time, whether it was at
my house or at The Grow, was just my way
[SPEAKER_01]: of stepping up and using each opportunity
as a learning experience, taking advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: of every mentor or consultant that I could
and just, you know, growing alongside the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said you started off just with
homegrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did your first homegrows look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What style of growing were you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I actually would do a whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people would do tents,
I think is how they would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would turn whole rooms into a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved all types of plants,
not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like all plants with ethnobotanical
significance or, you know, historical
[SPEAKER_01]: significance with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that cannabis is an amazing,
amazing plant, but there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow all types of plants from,
you know, even tobacco, nicotine or
[SPEAKER_01]: rustica to all sort of cacti, all sorts of
plants at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned entire rooms into into grows
used back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was your only option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd kind of lined everything in plastic
and have like a little pass through area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty kind of state of the art for
back then for being just in a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a lot of cleanliness
protocols that I still had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was growing in soil at the time and
just learning as much as I could and then
[SPEAKER_01]: testing things in real time is a lot of
trial and error, a lot of killing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using like a nutrient line or
were you mixing your own soil back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you how are you approaching it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was buying pre-made soil mixes and then
testing different amendments, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the teaming with microbe stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd use basically worm castings and teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the beginning of my cultivation
career, I was using fish emulsion and
[SPEAKER_01]: humic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started off on the right foot,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this information from other
growers who provided me with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little secret, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the secret sauce,
I think, that I've been using almost my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole career is a combination of fish
hydrolysate and humic acids and kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to highlight for folks,
fish emulsion is very different than fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure one is going to
be high in nitrogen, the other is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be higher in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware that they're two very
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about starting off with a
home grow then and then getting into more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the commercial side of the industry,
where did you kind of go from there and
[SPEAKER_00]: how did you get your first start?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just friendships and relationships
that I had with people, which are really
[SPEAKER_01]: everything back in the day before the
industry was really solidified.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was who you knew and the relationships
that you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only worked with people that we could
trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up giving one of my dear
friends I would save all my colas,
[SPEAKER_01]: like my best colas for my best rounds I
would keep in mason jars and just have
[SPEAKER_01]: them on a shelf, kind of like a display.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd crack into them every now and then
if I wanted a little special treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I gave a nice big cola to a dear
friend of mine who was well connected in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he referred me to one of his
connections by Newman Lake, which is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the border of Washington and Idaho.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got to step in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as kind of like a consultant and just
a labor hand, honestly, I helped with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, whether it was pruning and
defoliating or watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned as much as I could from the
other guys there and also just provided
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge that I had and ended up
working out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of started, it sounds like
kind of right at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, just as a laborer and kind of
worked your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went from growing relatively small
in these rooms to seeing a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: level of scale, it sounds like,
on the commercial side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the big differences between
growing in your house versus growing on
[SPEAKER_00]: scale commercially?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a totally different beast just to be
forthcoming about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a totally different beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're at your house, you can do
everything yourself, which is awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can take all the care that you
want on just a small handful of plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on scale, you have to think about
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to think about labor inputs,
like what's the true value added from this
[SPEAKER_01]: action or this input and really analyze
those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, any problems that you have or
imbalances or pests or anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes zero to 60, like really, really fast,
where it's much more controlled in a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based off that, I would think the keys
to growing commercially, like what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: describing there, you really want to have
a robust IPM program where you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting because you do have so many
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also can't afford to use a
lot of these marketed hype products just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the cost on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of the main things there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And early identification of any of those
things is going to save you a ton of money
[SPEAKER_01]: down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just being preventative out the
gate is going to save you a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's beneficial insect programs
or your crop nutrition, whether you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: soil tests to be able to anticipate things
that are coming versus waiting until those
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or disease or anything like
that is at a later stage and identified on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant, if you can catch those things
before they manifest into something pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, it's going to save you a ton down the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of want to get into that,
but I also just want to move on a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, too, to where you kind of went from
there, keeping this a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: chronological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can come back to some of the
pointers and tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like after being in Eastern Washington,
if I remember correctly, I think you moved
[SPEAKER_00]: on to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, from there, I went to a big
row in Airway Heights, Spokane area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did awesome there, outdoor raised beds
and then some big hoop houses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did we did really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tight knit group of friends kind
of live in the dream, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a cultivator's perspective,
when you could just manage a grill with a
[SPEAKER_01]: few guys looking back on it now,
it's really just like this dream,
[SPEAKER_01]: like almost romantic situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like just ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we crushed it just like honestly,
if you have a group of guys who are
[SPEAKER_01]: mission driven and everybody's bought in
like and just willing to do what it takes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to succeed in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did really, really well from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Okanagan a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are pretty harsh, harsh
climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okanagan is a little bit even more extreme
where you have really hot temperatures,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry, dry summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at night, especially towards the
fall, they can get really cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those cold spells can really spike the
humidity and cause some issues there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did really, really great, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to learn to stage my outdoor crops
based off of flowering time, put in some
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers for an early season spring
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be able to maximize your
outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, as many chunks as you can split
that harvest season into is really going
[SPEAKER_01]: to maximize your dry space, which is
always a massive limiting factor for
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from there, I got the opportunity
to get my foot in the door into Europe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk real briefly about that
Okanagan experience in the sense of drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you mentioned, everyone is running
outdoor crops there because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a very clear end date in
sight where the weather changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How were people effectively drying and
curing such massive harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you already touched on one thing,
which is breaking it up into more harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: by doing an auto flower season first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would reduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give you an early harvest when
not everyone else is harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also shrink your harvest a little
bit, I would assume, for the for the
[SPEAKER_00]: second round over the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what were your pointers there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so with those early auto flower
harvests, they're they're super crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only can you bring down that
harvest, but you also can house a product
[SPEAKER_01]: for sale at the beginning of the year,
which is really, you know, a revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: driver for a lot of outdoor farms where
typically they don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the farms out there are
probably doing large, larger scale garage
[SPEAKER_01]: pole barn setups without a lot of
equipment or infrastructure to help
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate the internal environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of typical with an outdoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were fortunate enough, though,
to have two completely indoor dry rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was totally climatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I dry, I try to really remove 50
percent or so of the total moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: content of that flower within about the
first 48 hours, 24 to 48 hours to really
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce any chances of pathogen growth or
anything like that that may occur during
[SPEAKER_01]: that drying stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the rest of the phase,
ideally the rest of that two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go low and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to drop your temps,
increase your humidity and just try to
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly, slowly kind of balance out and
homogenize that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the beginning, the outside of
the flower may dry out quicker and you may
[SPEAKER_01]: have some moisture that's trapped in the
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going kind of low and slow,
as I like to say, is really going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: balance that out and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would work with two week intervals
and have that for kind of these harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks and work with early short photo
periodic varieties to bring down after
[SPEAKER_01]: that auto flower harvest in early or mid
September and then have a late September
[SPEAKER_01]: block and an early October block.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time, you usually have a cold snap
that is either snow or it's frost or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so only the most hardy varieties are
going to survive past that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you could get maybe a later
October harvest as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so yeah, so you're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start harvesting pretty early,
but because of the massive amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you have, you're kind of
breaking it up based on how the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want like a wide range of finishing
times, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how did your product then compare to
all the pole barn folks that were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, having at the mercy of the
environment and in their caring rooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what were the big differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be a bit biased in this regard
because it's my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be totally honest, I thought we
grew some really, really amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to typically in those
pole barn setups, you're not going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to carry through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may smell a little bit still like like
chlorophyll, like some grass or some hay,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those off flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: May still be present in there,
whereas if you have an optimal dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing time, you're going to preserve more
of those volatile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a better flavor,
a smoother smoke and just a better overall
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the final flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably have less risk of
pathogens, too, I would say as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underpersons are all good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, moving on then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're you're off to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about that,
that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that was an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm truly fortunate and blessed to be
able to have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to go to Eastern Europe in
Macedonia for my first operation over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an intro into GACP and GMP like
real pharmaceutical grade type of
[SPEAKER_01]: production and manufacturing, which is
kind of probably where the industry will
[SPEAKER_01]: be headed, at least as far as a medical
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we over here should be
landing in more of a food grade standard,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas over there they're doing a
pharmaceutical standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get into the nuances of each
one of those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, the GACP is good
agricultural and collection practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just going to ensure it's
going to really try to ensure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have homogeneity within the batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not too much variation as far
as cannabinoids or terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to monitor your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make sure that your SOPs are
all in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is that if you have a patient,
they can actually set up doses and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas over here, if you eat an edible,
you never know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be not feeling anything and you
may be in a spaceship in your room with
[SPEAKER_01]: the lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing a big difference in
variability in edibles on the market here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Washington or is it pretty well
standardized?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty well standardized at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we are now to the point where
we're able to maintain those higher level
[SPEAKER_01]: of standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at Smokey Point, we have an amazing
kitchen staff, full commercial kitchen and
[SPEAKER_01]: just absolute top of the line edibles with
consistency all the way through with award
[SPEAKER_01]: winning chocolates and savories and
sweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough good things about the
team over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a user, you probably
remember the dark ages where you would get
[SPEAKER_01]: a cookie and maybe take a bite of that
cookie and eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're getting a cookie and like a
Ziploc baggie and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: only eat this much of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone has that edible story,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day I'll share mine on air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the setup in Macedonia?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked a little bit about the GMP
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite familiar with it, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the board for a company in
Australia and it's been really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about that side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the sake of the podcast,
let's talk a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What scale are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share your insight there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started indoors just on racks like
LEDs, a standard setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would veg them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call it an interim room,
but it was a standard bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put them outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be totally clear, I just got
this company kind of started at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning stages of their development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped them write SOPs and I helped them
get through the licensing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fully licensed and we were
starting to cultivate by the time that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had left there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had never finished any flowering
cycles or anything like that with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in the stages of water treatment
buildouts, greenhouse buildouts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were running living soil in pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a cool setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just honestly offered an amazing
opportunity from there that I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: turn down in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of jumped ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ended up in Portugal and you want
to touch on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go on to Smokey Point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Portugal is just the best opportunity
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing country, amazing people,
amazing food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can say enough good things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got started there with a pharmaceutical
company at the totally ground floor of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything before the land was even
purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to come out the gate kind of
setting things up the right way,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we chose the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We set up an outdoor kind of an R&D plot
and a pretty large scale greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total property was about 105 hectares.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a real large scale grow where
we're talking acres or hectares instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just an amazing opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were running living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to do a custom soil formulation
with a big European soil provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked with them with the soil tests to
make little changes and tweaks as we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: those come back and how that soil was
performing in its environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I got to do really amazing
things with the amazing team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I surrounded myself with people who are
much smarter than me and set up a real
[SPEAKER_01]: great opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you going directly in ground or
were you in in pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: So inside we were in pots, then outside we
were in like a windrow style raised beds
[SPEAKER_01]: with furrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the tractors through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hired a lot of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hired local farmers to create those
beds for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we set in drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we just amended it and ran drip
tape and water only for the outdoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: relied on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it was when you say windrows,
then you were you're putting in big
[SPEAKER_00]: trenches of potting soil, living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants were growing in those
trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I used the wrong term there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were amending the soil, adding
organic material to it, gypsum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then balancing out any nutrient
imbalances that we saw and then doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: light tilling and then creating those
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're actually growing in the
native soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always encourage folks to use the native
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can, if they can pass for heavy
metals, if they don't have a high flood
[SPEAKER_00]: floodplain there or if they don't have any
burrowing creatures like gophers and
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going to be causing big
problems, then it's better to go right
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground for a ton of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moles are always fun to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily there, we were good on that
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil was a little compact,
but we added some gypsum in there and it
[SPEAKER_01]: really did help actually create some of
that aggregate and create some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage, balance out any of the calcium
problems that we were seeing and help with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the salinity factors as well,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gypsum helped quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to add a little bit of sulfur as
well to lower the pH, but not not too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The native soil was really good,
pretty much out the gate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've grown, it sounds like mostly
outdoor at this point on the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and you got this opportunity if I'm
remembering things in order to come over
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Washington at Smokey Point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that the next stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should clarify that at a few of my
operations in the past, we had some small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale indoor operations, just a few rooms
at each spot, but nothing like we have at
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokey Point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I met, when I met you,
I think you shot me an email and we
[SPEAKER_00]: started chatting and I remember how,
and then I came up to Smokey Point and met
[SPEAKER_00]: you in person and took a visit of the
facility and I'd been up to Smokey Point
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Smokey Point has been around since the
beginning of 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had a company called The
Clone Zone, which was really smart by the
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, Brian Laid, who I knew through
the industry at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, right when we went legal here
in Washington on the rec side,
[SPEAKER_00]: they already had a company providing
clones and so he was able, they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide clones to the vast majority of
the industry legally because people were
[SPEAKER_00]: having trouble sourcing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand, they withheld some
of the certain cultivars for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: that they grew internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they had sort of unique genetics
on the market that no one else was putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out because everyone else was putting out
all the other stuff they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a really, it was,
it was a really ingenious way of
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching the emerging market,
you know, in a legal state that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: was really profitable for the company at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know anything about
that time period because you weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: around yet, but yeah, I can talk about
more, but is there anything you want to
add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that since then, The Clone Zone has
really evolved and has become our research
[SPEAKER_01]: and development and breeding facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I met Brian, he was working on,
he was having issues with his compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he wanted me to come up,
do some microscopy and figure out what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did a little bit of consulting on
that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did one run in, I think, five gallon
pots using our soil with chemical nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: salts over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came up there, the plants
looked phenomenal, but they ended up going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a purely salt program just because
that was what they were more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of lost touch with them over
the years until you reached out saying you
[SPEAKER_00]: were working at Smokey Point because I
know the company went through a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different iterations over that time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I was excited to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say, when I first visited
Smokey Point, I was blown away by the
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfulness that went into the
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to show a tour of this soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was one of the best managed and
cleanest facilities I'd ever visited at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, bring me up to the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Smokey Point now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming into a facility with good bones
makes everything so much easier on me and
[SPEAKER_01]: my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really awesome that they did
move forward with that thoughtfulness just
[SPEAKER_01]: with the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tried to continue that as much as
possible, just that level of cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we do this better and more
thoroughly than probably almost all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, when we cycle a room,
we remove all of our tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our irrigation lines get rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get flushed out and cleaned off and
sanitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single surface gets sanitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We remove every light off the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets wiped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every surface gets touched, sanitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every line gets blown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every filter gets changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, following that as a
fumigation of just like hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxyacetic acid, just to make sure
everything is totally sterile and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not cross contaminating or transferring
anything onto the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's very important that I know
that my cycles start off 100% clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't feel like that's overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that there's nothing
in that room that's potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated.
That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like especially when we're talking
spores out here on the west side of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, as you I'm sure are well
aware, powdery mildew, botrytis,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are serious issues that we deal with
as cultivators of these high humid
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to ensure that our crops have zero
powdery mildew and zero botrytis going to
[SPEAKER_01]: our customers, it means a lot to me and it
is at the forefront of my priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you cultivating now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the methodology that you're using
in the facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so one of the first changes that I
made coming into Smokey Point was
[SPEAKER_01]: switching over to a living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's a custom soil formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same type of deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to develop it a little bit over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do regular organic soil drenches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add in the fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add in some humic acid, fulvic acid,
amino acids, enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do some kelp and veg with fulvic foliar
sprays with some calcium to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we meet the calcium demands of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In living soils with a little bit smaller
containers, it's really difficult to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: up with the calcium demands of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have to really monitor my temps
and humidities and my soil moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: content and my calcium levels pretty
carefully to make sure that those demands
[SPEAKER_01]: are always met.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're trying to be as sustainable and
organic focused as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not perfect, and I'll just totally
admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're doing our absolute best,
especially considering the difficulties
[SPEAKER_01]: and the challenges of our industry and our
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs a little bit more for us to be
like, let me use this as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of our jars that we use for our
habitat line, we have a Habitat Premium
[SPEAKER_01]: line that we launched in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is going to be our top shelf
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of our jars are made from
recyclable glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our joint tubes are made from recycled
ocean plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some really cool things that I
think that are steps that we're taking to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to just be as sustainable as we can,
but it costs us a lot more money to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we switched our entire company
over to this, it would probably not work
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have that offering for people
who are just uncompromising, quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do have that offering for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you're in Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not actually using our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to clarify for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an advertisement for my
company because you're not using any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've we've we've had conversations
about ways that you might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce inputs or potentially change some
of your fertilizing practices to save
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and reduce the number of touches and
applications, which is something I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're always looking at and experimenting
with, which is, I think, really important
[SPEAKER_00]: in any facility that you're always
striving towards improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one other thing to highlight is
that so you're what size container you and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started out a little bit bigger in a
seven gallon, but I had to reduce to a
[SPEAKER_01]: three gallon just due to the nature of the
competitiveness of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to reduce costs as much as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went to a three gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could still see the same amount of
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can kind of I know with living
soils, it's a little a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different than a typical like cocoa based
media or something with your drybacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works out really well for us where
I can almost have this hybrid approach of
[SPEAKER_01]: crop steering, which is kind of unheard of
with a lot of living soils and beds and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are doing that in hydro
application or or those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: To where.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we installed an automatic irrigation
system and I can drip into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my handwaters come through and
just make sure everything's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced and even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do multiple shot sizes similar to a
traditional crop steering program so that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can monitor my soil moisture and keep it
more in that Goldilocks zone with smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: shot intervals or smaller shot volumes
with more intervals so that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain kind of that Goldilocks zone
throughout the peak periods of the day and
[SPEAKER_01]: then watch our drybacks overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not allowing you're you're
reducing the amount of drybacks or
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in your soil moisture overall,
which is a lot harder, frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller the container, the harder that
is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty difficult for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I definitely wouldn't want to go
any smaller than a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people are going to be
listening this thing and say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not living soil because the pot is
size containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also not reusing the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably something we should
talk about, too, as to what went into that
[SPEAKER_00]: decision and that thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are having to bring in new soil
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do you choose to do that in your
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not reusing our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trialing reusing our soil right now
because I have concerns about viruses and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we we know that hoplite and viroid
is at very high concentrations in the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my concern is that if we chop and
even if we pull out the bulk of that root
[SPEAKER_01]: mass, that maybe there's a high viral load
in whatever roots may be remaining in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't put it through a thorough
composting process, that may be some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that viroid could transfer over to the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that we necessarily
have the viroid, but most people have the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very prevalent in our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure, like I said,
that my cycles are starting off clean and
[SPEAKER_01]: are clean and are the highest quality as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't want I want to mitigate
any risk of transferring viruses or
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids off to my next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I can imagine in a three gallon
container, you don't have a lot of media
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the root to media relationship
is probably there's probably not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: left at the end of the cycle by the time
you pull the roots out, I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not as much to recycle either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we are trialing this
currently to where I am cutting it with
[SPEAKER_01]: new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for example, a three to one ratio
of used soil to do soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the trials that we're running
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually having some some pretty
good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: My my next step is just to make sure that
we do thorough pathogen testing and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that that nothing weird is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that would there's a lot of
labor that goes into bringing in and cost
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with bringing in new soil,
filling the pots, getting them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, getting them out of the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of labor that goes into
recycling the soil in containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the reasons a lot of folks
like beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can totally understand the viroid
concern and why you guys have gone down
[SPEAKER_00]: the path that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting to think and
talk it out so people can kind of hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: thought process behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we've even talked about
exactly how large Smokey Point really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks can have an idea of what we're
what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what scale are you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're tier three to three is the
largest license that's available in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the clone zone license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rolling farms licenses are spotted
at Smokey Point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we even are bringing over because
the LCB recently redefined what their
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of canopy is, which is really
unfortunate for almost all producer
[SPEAKER_01]: processors in the state right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually have to relocate our
clone zone license over to rolling farms
[SPEAKER_01]: just to make sure that we're staying at
maximum capacity over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not like necessarily a bad thing
because this whole last year, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have the opportunity of breeding
at the clone zone and doing research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I have so many seeds
and phenos to test and hunt that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: last me like the next three, four years,
literally a pheno hunting and stuff over
[SPEAKER_01]: at rolling farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just absolutely stoked to be able
to to use those seeds and those genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were able to develop and test them
out at rolling farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so throw out a number here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is Smokey Point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the rolling farms license is for
30,000 square foot active canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the clone zone is a tier two,
which is going to be 10,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: active canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you're maxing that out more or
less at this point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30,000 square feet of flowering canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what does a typical room size look
for you look like for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about we have 960 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 80 tables, 12 plants, a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are about 4000 square foot rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With with almost a thousand plants in each
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have nine of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on weekly cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works out really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes down to the bones of the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They designed it really well around the
flowering times of the plants to where if
[SPEAKER_01]: we have nine rooms on nine week cycles
every every week, we have a crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're cropping on Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cleaning on Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're filling on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that cleaning that I said that
that these guys do is done hyper
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys just, you know,
bust their butts day in and day out to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to reduce our downtime and maximize
our production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of us having a really good staff,
having a motivated staff and a happy
[SPEAKER_00]: staff, and then also having really good
SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a I got a taste of that when I came
by the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what you
have just on the other door of every room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my first.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I have my irrigation cycles of each
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we implemented our drip system,
as I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of those schedules are posted
on the door so that my waterers can really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand when those irrigation cycles
are and where they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have my kind of kind of our crop
work schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we fill a room and we stage a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We properly space those plants on the
tables, which is super important to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will overlook that,
but just putting the plants in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: spots and making sure everything is evenly
spaced out is really going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we set our drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do our lowers, which is removing all of
the lower portions of the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't going to receive adequate light or
produce anything, anything substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We remove all of that so that the plant
can focus its efforts on maximizing a
[SPEAKER_01]: grade flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to then come through and we're
going to trellis everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We LST low stress train everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do any serious tying down or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell my team to put one cola in each six
by six inch square of trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can have a big branch and a big
cola in each one of those squares,
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider that canopy maximized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that schedule by the day is posted
on every door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have my team fill that out and
the lead will go over and check it,
[SPEAKER_01]: check that the task has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the SOP is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so is the training on that SOP so that
everyone's totally on the same page and
[SPEAKER_01]: those tasks are getting done efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also that the lead is checking up
that those things are getting done in an
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's sign-offs and dates so that
there's accountability for each task.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have REI signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we go above and beyond on our REI
signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And REI is a restricted entry interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that whenever a
pesticide is applied, it doesn't matter if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a soil drench, or if it's a foliar
application, or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And REI still applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a duration of time where
you can't enter that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say, for example, we soil drench
with something like Boveria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to have an REI of,
I believe, four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this information is going to be
provided in the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the information on my signs comes
directly from that label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we follow those to a T.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I even put, for early entry,
workers who have to enter that space
[SPEAKER_01]: before that REI is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I state the PPE requirements for that
early entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We state when we finish the application,
in this case, a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just literally just feeding the
plants Boveria bassiana, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple effects, but primarily as an
insecticide for soft-bodied insects in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rid zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are going to state those so that
anyone, even someone like yourself who's
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting those areas can feel comfortable
and safe and understand that this product
[SPEAKER_01]: was applied, or the last product was
applied in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the requirements to enter
that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it gets overlooked in a lot of
facilities, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't stress enough how important it
is to follow the instructions to a T on a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's something like Boveria,
because this is why we're running into
[SPEAKER_00]: pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why people are getting pesticide
poisoning and egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have proper PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to follow the REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I want to commend you guys
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you touched on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that you and I talked
about was that as an employee,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of those SOPs, being right there,
if someone walks up to it, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: standing around because someone can always
figure out what the next step is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dependent on the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dependent on the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's another thing to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to touch on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have multiple rooms, as I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do bloom walks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have multiple people doing bloom
walks.
[SPEAKER_01]: My IPM will do IPM-related bloom walks.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fertigation lead will do crop
nutrition-related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soil moisture content and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll check for all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go through and set a
priority list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll put that out to the entire team
so that they know, even though all these
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms, maybe, for example, let's say
multiple rooms need trellis, we'll set a
[SPEAKER_01]: priority list on which room to get in
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as they go to that room,
they just look at the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's checked off the list?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in regards to the facility itself,
I know that there's some limitations and
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges with the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of things that got
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are some of the challenges that
you face with your building, just the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the building and everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shape of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a large warehouse that has
basically a shell within a shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an internal structure built
with drop ceilings and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of a larger structure, which has
its benefits for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as insulatory capacity,
that shell actually helps with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a drop ceiling, you can't hang a
lot of weight from that ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our limitations, for example,
is the weight-bearing capacity of our
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wanted to deck out that ceiling
with lots of like 200 top-of-the-line
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs, it's going to weigh a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those LEDs weigh substantially more than a
traditional HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to swap over for us would be pretty
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess the things that we're doing
to maximize our production with that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: first and foremost, making sure that those
lights are at the proper spacing and
[SPEAKER_01]: distance from the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is super important to make
sure you're not wasting photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're maximizing the crossover of the
light to maximize your homogeneity at the
[SPEAKER_01]: max canopy height to make sure that all
the plants are getting the right amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: light and the right leaf surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not wasting photons on the lights
or the corridors as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're maximizing those light
levels for what you got and your leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface temperature, and then everything
else can kind of fall in line there by
[SPEAKER_01]: just adjusting your room pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the parameters as far as
temperature and humidity to also help with
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like leaf surface temperature about two
degrees cooler than our rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run our rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something cool that I've
implemented since I've been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you guys think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start our rooms pretty hot, relatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think hotter than most HPS growers,
because as you know, with an HPS,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have a higher leaf surface
temperature than if you're running with an
[SPEAKER_01]: LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who run LEDs have to increase
their room temps to get their leaf temps
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the right optimal level so that you
have the right transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we run right around 80, 82 degrees for
our room temps in the first weeks of bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: and a higher humidity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to optimize that VPD, the vapor
pressure deficit, it's super important to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you're maximizing your
transpiration rates and your nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from there, we'll slowly drop into
down throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll lower the temp, lower the
humidity step by step, kind of in tandem,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to lower your temperature
without lowering your humidity or your VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: will get out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to mess your
transpiration rates, increase pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, all these types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we slowly step down our temperature
and humidity to where when we're finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end, that temperature is pretty
low, around 70 degrees and a pretty dry
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that's going to do is to make
sure that you're not off gassing terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the terpenes are really volatile and
they're going to off gas and volatize at a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us to be able to preserve those,
we drop our temperatures pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly in the last couple of weeks
of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helps accentuate some of those
pigments like anthocyanins and
[SPEAKER_01]: carotenoids, like increase some of those
secondary metabolites in the end of flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and preserve some of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a cool little
environmental hack, I'd say, to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize the quality of the flower that
we're putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't I haven't heard of anyone do it
exactly that approach or lay it out so
[SPEAKER_00]: eloquently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, I couldn't remember
the word anthocyanin in my last interview
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Cornell researcher, and it was
bothering me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm recording these back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for triggering that word for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your light level at canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recently have been lowering all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm about at 700 max canopy right now,
which is super low for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, this is going to compromise
yields a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as overall flower quality,
our flower quality is just an absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: another level from where it was two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would implore anyone who tried smoky
point flower in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a pretty large consumer demand
and following.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you haven't tried us recently,
I just have to emphasize that you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: give us a shot because our flower quality
and our actually our extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't mind a shameless plug,
dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, no, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've made little changes that have
improved the quality of your of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and plant health over the last two
years is really what you're getting at,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on that note, when you're when
you're talking about your lights and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that the light levels were low,
I think they were even lower than that
[SPEAKER_00]: before you before you lowered the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so knowing that and, you know,
and still trying to run a production
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, you can't add lights because of
the weight issue with the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a highlight that on a
commercial scale, there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that you're dealing with that
force you to have to step outside of what
[SPEAKER_00]: is optimal necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, obviously, you know, if you could
wave a magic wand and have a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times there's reasons why
that's not realistic, whether it's budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's, you know, in this case,
the weight of your ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to learn to adapt and
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your other environment,
environmental parameters or other things
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be in order to stay in
business on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something that I kind of
want to highlight for folks, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's just the important reality of
this, you know, of growing on scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's things that you can do like
that, like lowering lights that really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't cost you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the the yoyos that that we bought
to lower those lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I call them yoyos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they they really are like pennies to
the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but to get the linear yield increase
that you're going to see from increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: your PPFD is is going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on that note, when we when we
talk about the light being the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor here, it wouldn't matter so much,
you know, how much you addressed fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: and these other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your light levels are so low that
they're just not the plants aren't able to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize what they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to really grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that you and I have talked
about is how you're always looking to make
[SPEAKER_00]: small changes as you see or identify what
you think is the biggest limiting factor
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth in a given room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to kind of touch on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes down to to costs and
everything as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other things that you can do
like like just monitoring your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, as you know, is one of the most
crucial aspects .
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing that we did was install
grow link controllers and soil moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a massive investment,
to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the you know, the results that you get
from being able to use an analytical tool
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a precise calculation of your soil
moisture is is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, for example, your environmental
controlling equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can if you can get these things
communicating with each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that, for example, if you have heaters
and air conditioners or air handlers in
[SPEAKER_01]: your rooms and they're set on separate
thermostats and maybe they've been running
[SPEAKER_01]: in your facility for five, six,
seven years, when's the last time those
[SPEAKER_01]: thermostats have been calibrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is everything totally accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is any of your equipment competing
with each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get it to make sure that is
communicating through a central controller
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's all being controlled together,
it's just going to increase the efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: of your room and your equipment as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To save you on that overhead expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've had some other challenges with
the with the infrastructure, either due to
[SPEAKER_00]: scale or due to the building, you know,
the infrastructure of the building itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to touch on
there in terms of small changes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: made, whether it's in harvesting,
curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could touch on harvesting,
harvesting and curing and drying,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of overloaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just focus on growing,
growing, growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even the best the best
grower in the world who produces an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing product, that product could be
ruined really quick if it's not dried or
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and cured under the right
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't emphasize this enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the major changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We revamped our entire dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, this is something that's
got a huge cost benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We implemented poly convection tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might see this stuff in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we implemented into our dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this basically is is like a a
plastic tube that we connect to a Max fan
[SPEAKER_01]: and we hang it from the ceiling and put it
right above our drying racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of having fans or like
oscillating fans that most people will
[SPEAKER_01]: have in their dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our dry room laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where we have a hanging rack and
another hanging rack next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in between those two hanging racks,
we have a convection tube that goes in
[SPEAKER_01]: parallel to it from above and gently,
gently blows air from top to bottom and
[SPEAKER_01]: then extracts from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have this almost laminar
airflow effect where none of the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: being bombarded or blasted with it with
air directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, you have this kind of soft,
gentle stream of air that's going in
[SPEAKER_01]: between the drying flowers and providing a
more consistent and homogenous,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, drying condition for the for the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was experimenting with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that in your facility first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wasn't even aware that it
existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I call it greenhouse convection
tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google that term, you can find it
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you go on our on our social media
accounts on Instagram, you can see some
[SPEAKER_00]: photos from micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it as under canopy airflow as
there's a company called Duck Socks that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a more robust version of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of a fabric material that you hook up
to a fan and then it pushes air and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was using it for under canopy
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a really cheap way of
experimenting with that in micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I so far really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it I think it's working really
well to get air underneath to improve my
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned something new and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm enjoying that experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so glad that I taught you something,
Ted, because you have taught me so much
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been it's been a fun experiment
running under canopy airflow because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've always wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there weren't there weren't a lot of
options for a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's stuff on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, yeah, this was like 30 or 40
dollars and I massively overpaid for what
[SPEAKER_00]: I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gave me the opportunity to try it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still seeing if there's a way I can
offer it to folks more affordably,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's literally just a plastic
bag tube that's like anywhere from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, eight to 12 inches in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a couple of holes in it with
a hole punch is spaced out so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just putting that air out more passively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a massive volume of air at a
very low airflow rate, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's interesting that you're
using that in the in the drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also using to plug a company that
I've seen now in a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using those drying hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the brand is or what
they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to you want to go ahead and give
them a little plug?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough good things about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys are making really high
quality drying racks and it makes stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really easy for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these mobile racks on really
high quality aluminum racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using these kind of since I've
been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still using the exact same setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nothing like super durable,
very easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really ask for much more than
than what these guys are providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they are, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only seen it now in a couple of
facilities that you guys and collective
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love the ingenuity behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, super easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You harvest and put it on these they look
like kind of like massive coat hangers for
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of a better way to visually describe
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just put the you put the branches
and the buds directly on there to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: them to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just wheel that right
into your you're curing your drying space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have like some permanent
poles, let's say, that stay in our dry
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of you, you definitely can't
just wheel those racks into your dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is we, you know, we save on the
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only bought a couple of those racks,
which worked out really well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we transport the sticks, which is what
the coat hang, let's say coat hangers are
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We transport those with the racks and then
we just raise up the entire stick and hang
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the poles in the dry room and then
reuse those two racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only have two rolling racks for our
entire facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, can't say enough good things
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just so much better than
trying to throw it all into a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: totes and carry it down to your dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's harder on the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's it's just a really
good solution if folks aren't aware of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I hadn't seen it in a lot of
facilities until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, you know, maybe everyone knows
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, it's just something people
should consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: It minimizes touches, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like literally just touching the
stem when we chop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hang it one time on that hanger and
then we don't ever, you know, have to
[SPEAKER_01]: reposition that plant until it comes out
of the dry room, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anything else you want to touch on
regarding the harvesting, drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing side of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we implemented also this bearing
barrel curing protocol, which I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to see, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that most producer processors
should be doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us are, but some of us aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just say, you know,
and we're also doing moisture readings
[SPEAKER_01]: daily on our drying flowers so that I can
adjust the parameters of our dry room to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that it's always in the optimal
conditions, because when it comes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure it's at the perfect
moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I know I've had some technical
issues the last couple of podcasts as I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trying out new software.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this podcast ended so abruptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got it all smoothed out
moving forward, though.
