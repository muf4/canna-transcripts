[SPEAKER_00]: So someone commented on one of my recent
YouTube videos with a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked, one, what are you doing in a
garage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, why didn't you prune the plants
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got me thinking, and I wanted to
give a thoughtful reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I'm in a garage is because
this is a tester room that I set up to try
[SPEAKER_00]: out new products, different ways of
growing, and also have a place just to
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be able to demonstrate how
simple and easy it is to grow plants in an
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable manner without a whole bunch of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it got me thinking about why I
prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because subconsciously, I wasn't really
concerned with how much pruning I had done
[SPEAKER_00]: in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to talk to you kind of about
why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we prune?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the main reasons we prune is
for pest and pathogen pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: By reducing the amount of leaf mass that
we have here, we're effectively reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat for pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also increasing airflow by doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by increasing airflow, there's no
pockets for different microclimates for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew or other pathogens to start
growing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason that we prune is for
herbivory, this idea that insects are
[SPEAKER_00]: chewing on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we create a wound here by
cutting off this fan leaf, essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing is we're triggering SAR,
which is systemic acquired resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: the immune system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has a ton of benefits too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all various reasons why we
prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other last reason I want to mention is
that some leaves lower down on the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: are not photosynthesizing as effectively
as leaves appear towards the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that are shaded out down here
potentially are nutrient sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing those, they're no longer
required by the plant to put energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, as we remove leaves, we have to
keep in mind that some mobile nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to be pulled from lower families
if the plant found a deficiency or needed
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought on it is I have sufficient
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see down below here, I turned it
off, but I have some under canopy airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other fans throughout the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have really good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes down to, to me,
time and labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more of an issue in a
commercial facility, but I've been really
[SPEAKER_00]: busy lately with work and family stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had the time that I've wanted
to come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And necessarily remove all the leaves that
may not be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't felt any pressure do that
either, because like I said, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons below, I feel pretty confident in
where I'm at right now and where my canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: is to where I'm not really worried about
so much the pest and pathogen issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather not spend that time
pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a little bit behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a commercial facility,
you have to realize like there's a trade
[SPEAKER_00]: off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much do I need to prune to reduce
pest and pathogen pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without causing so much labor that I'm
raising my labor costs so high without
[SPEAKER_00]: really improving my yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is always a trade off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pruning can almost be more of an art
than a skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain things that we want to
consider when we're pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall that, that's sort of what's
going through my head when I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: like when to prune, why to prune and,
and how to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and one last thing to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing is to open up the plant
and allow for light to hit various bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too many large families
blocking those, those buds just don't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop quite as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope this is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking it out.
Thanks for watching.
