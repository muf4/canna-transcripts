[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is about how a commercial
cannabis facility was able to dramatically
[SPEAKER_02]: increase their yields by making some small
changes in operations that allowed them to
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate science and the scientific
method, which was key in making decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: that both reduced labor costs and
increased yields by more than 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this podcast, I talk with Dr. Ben
Higgins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben works with both Goldleaf Gardens and
Kiss Organics and is also a part of our
[SPEAKER_02]: consulting group.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the research scientist for Goldleaf
and with Kiss Organics, he handles the
[SPEAKER_02]: custom blue mat designs for growers,
as well as assisting with our product
[SPEAKER_02]: development and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben earned his PhD in ecology and
evolutionary biology from the University
[SPEAKER_02]: of California, Santa Cruz, where he
studied functional ecology, organismal
[SPEAKER_02]: morphometrics, and physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Olympia, Washington with his
wife and two daughters and loves to
[SPEAKER_02]: explore the natural beauty of the area
with them as often as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ben, thanks for coming back on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you and I talk all the time,
so it's going to be pretty casual here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to get you back on the show
because I know you've been doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: research and experiments that I thought
would be interesting to share with
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we dive into what those
experiments were, I want to talk a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit about how you've been using science to
really increase yields and improve your
[SPEAKER_02]: decision making at the facility that
you've been working at over the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me a little bit about how you
started working there, what your role is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's just give listeners a little
background there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun because my background
up until moving to Washington and starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with Nate and all the other guys
over at Goldleaf was strictly marine
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got both my master's and my doctorate in
marine based ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming and then to Olympia and then
getting kind of thrown into the land of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and soil, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just as I got into, for example,
my dissertation topic was actually on the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional ecology of Maury Eels,
the California Maury Eel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I did that, I didn't know
anything about the functional ecology of
[SPEAKER_00]: the California Maury Eel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a nervous and exciting time
to kind of be exposed to a brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've learned
from my many times working on different
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and experiments all throughout my
educational and academic and now kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: professional career is that you really
need to spend the time to learn your
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, even coming out of,
you know, fresh PhD graduate, coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: a new universe, I needed to live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to soak it up and I needed to not
come in to any situation thinking I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't, I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, there's still a
significant amount of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the point of figuring it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask the questions, you observe,
you listen to people who have the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, you know, some back again,
I'll probably be trying to draw a few
[SPEAKER_00]: parallels to my doctoral program here
throughout this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when we were, you know,
studying mores and stuff, the fishermen
[SPEAKER_00]: and fishing companies were invaluable
resources because they've spent the time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the water, you know, looking for things
and seeing things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks like me who were in a lab or in a
classroom just don't have the time or the
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treating everybody like they're their
own professional, their own expert is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really important way to stay open-minded,
regardless of anyone's background,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of educational background,
professional background, or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got to Goldleaf, I was very much
aware that I was, you know, as Bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, used the term from fishing and
stuff, I was a greenhorn, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I did the science, I know how to do
science, I know how to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't know how to apply it to
cannabis, let alone, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a tier two operation, which was,
you know, moving along and it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure, it had
workflows, it had schedules and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to come in and say, oh,
here's this scientist now who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at X, Y, and Z, you know,
it's got him fit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept my head down pretty much for an
entire year, just learning the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning the system, you know,
getting to work with the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of figuring out,
you know, like I said, my system,
[SPEAKER_00]: my new study organism, which, you know,
a lot of folks will say is cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't really look at cannabis as the
target, really, for me, it's about the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, because coming as an ecologist,
that was something that was probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest to translate to me, the physiology
of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And metabolism of animals, that's a wholly
different ball game than cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but ecology is ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went from scuba diving,
you know, looking at underwater
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, kelp forests and sandy bottom
floors, and I understood how species
[SPEAKER_00]: interacted and, you know, ate each other
or competed against one another or
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperated with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to take that little bit of
understanding and kind of build off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a soil framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly at Goldleaf, it worked out
really well because they treat the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much about what's going on
beneath the plant that dictates what you
[SPEAKER_00]: see come harvest time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always tell folks that I see the
plant as a, it's kind of like an oil
[SPEAKER_00]: dipstick, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the engine is actually the soil,
and if you look at the plant, it's telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you whether or not what's going on
underneath there is healthy or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that kind of background and
introduction, I slowly got more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the glossary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not great on the strains because
I was changed so frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we started figuring out little
pieces of areas and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: little pitfalls and little gaps where,
oh, maybe this will be different if we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried this or we tried this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, it just boils down to
troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I got my feet under me and once I
got comfortable and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: once everybody else there was comfortable,
we could start trying to turn some knobs
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, adjust some dials and see
if we can make things better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to clarify, you came into a
facility that was running quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Goldleaf, I know we talk about
Goldleaf a lot, but that's because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: good friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a strong relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually hired Ben and now I share Ben
with Goldleaf, which works out really well
[SPEAKER_02]: between Kiss and Goldleaf in terms of
being able to do research and being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to trial things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're super excited to have Ben
kind of going in both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you actually got in there,
you got your hands dirty for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: year, working side by side with all the
gardeners or farmers there, really
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how to cultivate cannabis from
the ground floor up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you and Nate, who's the owner of
Goldleaf, started to have conversations
[SPEAKER_02]: about, like you said, things that you
could look at that may improve yield or
[SPEAKER_02]: may be limiting factors of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were the first things, what were the
first questions you started to ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about about that aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you go about formulating the
right question so you even know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to look at from a science
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often one of the most overlooked
and most important parts of the whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'll hear the term scientific
process, right, which you got to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a stage before that that's all
the more important because it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: the first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to make an observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look for something to ask that
question, to make that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just go into Goldleaf and say,
well, what about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's test this because I didn't
look and you don't have that that
[SPEAKER_00]: background, that that that reference
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, spending that time not doing
anything other than observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to start generating questions
like, what if we changed this amendment or
[SPEAKER_00]: what if we changed our irrigation
techniques a little bit or the life
[SPEAKER_00]: training techniques or, you know,
what if we and some of it wasn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the plant or the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we just made the place look a
little bit more like a lab, like a like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have checklists and,
you know, you look at make sure things are
[SPEAKER_00]: checked off and done and, you know,
just to keep the that whole constant
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable process round after round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, if you are testing something,
or something goes great, or if something
[SPEAKER_00]: goes wrong, you have a record of where you
might be able to look and find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really taking the time to generate a
question is so, so critical because with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad question, you can go forward and try
to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have a really hard
time getting an answer that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: informative that that will that won't end
up costing you either time, money or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, unless your facility or
your little grow has a little like a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific R&D room or, you know,
section, you know, most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, they're trying to maximize
canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time we take on a trial,
it's a risk, because if something goes
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly or it doesn't produce well,
which has happened, then you're cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: into, you know, your your product and your
yield and your bottom line and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we'll get approached by
numerous companies that want to want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: try this or try that nutrients or
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's not always a yeah,
let's give it a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we look at it, we do our research,
we ask the question, we see what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, you know, how many beds we can
sacrifice to the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the first questions that Nate
and I tried to tackle were, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably the most common for for
growers is how do I increase my yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these guys at Gold Leaf are
incredible growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't that it wasn't very easy to
try to push that envelope even farther
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had such a great
understanding of, you know, soil ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew what they were doing with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, again, you're hearing this
from someone who had no idea what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really inspiring to be around
these guys and try to learn as much as I
[SPEAKER_00]: could and as fast as I could try to help
wherever I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there were little parts and
compartments of nutrients, amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae products, those were kind of
the first little things because they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't huge investments to to try to see
if we could, you know, bump the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any percent is always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, that's kind of how we
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we would design little experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would draft a proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd show it to Nate and show him,
you know, what it would take space wise
[SPEAKER_00]: and bed wise and plant wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always going to be that that
little bit of back and forth right between
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure you have enough data to to
make an informed decision versus getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into this stage of I'll call it analysis
paralysis, right, where you you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a decision at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finding that fine line between not
enough data and not being comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: making a decision based on the data you
have is tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes time as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I want to highlight is that
this scientific method or practice doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be applied strictly, like you
said, to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these things can be ways of just
it all fits in with sort of lean
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing and this idea that we can
make everything more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for example, you could look at
possibly adding, like like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: the documentation or clipboards that have
SOPs on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could look at that and then you could
measure, well, is this saving us time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be your your variable that
you're measuring is labor hours in that
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it reducing the number of errors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something you could track.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to figure out once you have
that question, then you also have to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what the variables are and how
they have to be observable and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think those are important things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm jumping the gun a little bit
getting into variables here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking once you have that question
and I think it would be good to pick a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation question because a lot of
folks can people can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's take give me an example from
one of the experiments that you ran,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the very first ones I did,
it was just a micro risal amendment that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd add right before transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just wanting to see if yields
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, that's basically the big
question that that a lot of these products
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to tackle is how how does this
increase my yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to show up at the end of
the harvest in wet weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are trying to get better about
tracking that all the way through dry
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mechanism for how that's
happening, that's a much, much deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: question that that's how you get into the
five or six year doctoral program kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of work is, OK, we see this
pattern where if I add this, the yields go
[SPEAKER_00]: up or if I add this, the yields go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the actual mechanism between how
that's happening and what's causing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes a lot of inquiry and a lot of
experimentation and a lot of time that
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously not a whole lot of businesses
have nor need to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it helps and it helps, if it doesn't,
then it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, like the first one we looked
at, we added I can't remember the name of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product, but it was just a mycorrhizal
association that we would throw into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil right before we transplanted the
plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would wait and we would track some
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would look to see if there was anything
terribly noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do some image analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was looking at, you know,
growth patterns and seeing if we had
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter internodal spacing, if plants were
generally bigger, if they had better
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary growth development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the stocks were bigger at the base
or 50 percent up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these kind of morphometric plant
measurements I was trying to track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end result was we didn't really
see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say a difference, we didn't see
a statistically significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing that you're going
to have to try to figure out is the more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you measure individually,
each one of those becomes a data point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grants you a lot more power to
detect a signal of something making a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, let's say I had two beds
of this treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to add this new product and
each bed had eight plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had two plants and two beds that
were served as our controls.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to then say, well,
there's two beds worth, then my end
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm just measuring the bed,
all the plants in the bed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: that becomes an end of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can spend the time and not slow down
the whole operation to measure each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants individually, then my end
goes all the way up to 16, which is a much
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do a lot of more advanced
statistical analyses using bigger numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things like analysis of variance
or ANOVA's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's nonparametric data, you can use
different tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that will no matter always
limit you is not having enough data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of go back again to just
finding how much space, how many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can we get, can we use to confidently
answer this question?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to add a couple of things to
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I think the big takeaway here is we
can't just say, you know, if we throw two
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in two pots and one grows bigger
than the other, there's no there's no way
[SPEAKER_02]: we can draw any statistical significance
as to why one plant grew more than the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to have enough plants,
which is our end value in this case,
[SPEAKER_02]: enough data points that we can see like
statistical trending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for a commercial facility,
they probably don't have a research
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist on staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really need to to set up a basic
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want people to be discouraged
by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to run ANOVA's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to be able to do all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you do need to do is say,
OK, this is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to dedicate a portion of the
facility to be constantly looking at how
[SPEAKER_02]: we can improve the way we're growing and
testing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in this case with mycorrhizal
fungus, you found that there in your
[SPEAKER_02]: particular facility, in the in the way
that you cultivate, it did not make sense
[SPEAKER_02]: to add mycorrhizal fungus every growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that doesn't mean the mycorrhizal
fungus doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that mycorrhizal fungus
doesn't work in beds over successive runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't draw these conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where that five to six year
understanding of mechanism comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can do that's really
powerful, like you're saying here,
[SPEAKER_02]: is you can say in our in this particular
situation, it may not be worth the money
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're spending to be adding this
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you could get interesting with this
and say, OK, well, maybe we added every
[SPEAKER_02]: third cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we see any advantage coming back to
this experiment in six months?
[SPEAKER_02]: So so there's a lot of ways a lot of about
this process creates more questions down
[SPEAKER_02]: the road, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important to be OK with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it OK with that, that means
you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you get to the end of the
experiment and you have your answer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done, you're not you're not really
addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're not really expanding upon
the data you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of go back to this example
we're talking about where, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that was across one strain at any
given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have as many as 10 or 12 strains
in a room at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics, obviously, is another
variable that we'd want to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to control for that, you'd want to run
this experiments across multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, you'd want to do this
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd want to do this more times to make
sure that, you know, an end of one trial
[SPEAKER_00]: is really not enough, like you said,
to make any kind of informed decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simply just looking for
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see a pattern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it always shows up in this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this strain seems to really like
this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to use this strain or keep
going with this strain, this is a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that we might want to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product, we don't see any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product, it affects it negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always data, even negative
data, if you will, even data that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you and is not positive,
is positive, meaning that you've answered
[SPEAKER_00]: your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result of the scientific method is
not to get better yields or to get bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to just answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the experiment is successful if it
lets you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whatever the answer is, the science
is not going to is non-biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to say, well, you know,
you asked this question, so it was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the experiment was bad and
your science was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time the experiment is not great
is when you, again, don't have a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: question and the data doesn't let you
support one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to talk a little more about
this because I think as I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: your example here, it makes me realize,
like, people will draw conclusions that
[SPEAKER_02]: are inaccurate, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, someone might listen to
this podcast and say, mycorrhizal fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't work in living soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not an accurate statement based
on what experiment you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could say that there may be cause for
further research, but that's always the
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think is interesting is we see
this in the industry all the time where
[SPEAKER_02]: people will say they ran an experiment,
they drew a conclusion, and then people
[SPEAKER_02]: will take that as if it is just,
you know, written in stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, for example, if I was evaluating
this, your methodology, I would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing I'd want to look at is
like, what is the pH of your soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your phosphorus levels in the
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you introduce the mycorrhizal
fungus into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check for viability prior to
introduction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check for infection rates?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know you didn't do all
those things because that's a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: science than you have the, you know,
really the time or ability to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't the question that you were
trying to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not trying to make, you know,
make those kinds of determinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a quick and dirty science
experiment for your facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are this is sort of what I want
to guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can do these experiments
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they absolutely should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whether people realize it or not,
you know, they're doing science every day
[SPEAKER_00]: at these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data is being collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're you're measuring your
harvest weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're measuring your dry weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're measuring your inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're measuring, you know, your
amendments, your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are getting measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not, you can write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's no secret to, well,
just put this down on a notebook or on an
[SPEAKER_00]: Excel file or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the analysis obviously does get a
little bit trickier, but there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to add data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have too much data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, for example, if you turn on the light
switch when you get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light doesn't turn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just already made you've entered
the scientific process unknowingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made an observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light didn't go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're going through your head and
making hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most often times the light bulb
burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You switch the light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work or did it not work?
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, you got an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that point on, you make your
decision and your next experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the light didn't turn back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must not be the light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brand new bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the switch is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you test the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, people do science a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love for it to become such a thing
where it gets the appropriate name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, troubleshooting is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to say, how can we make this
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the, what's the, what's holding us
back or what can we add to break through a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a glass ceiling here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything we can tweak?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we know we, you know,
literally do we change the light bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we have, and we did,
and we've, we've seen the plants respond
[SPEAKER_00]: and the harvest yields respond
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys have made some leaps and
bounds over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, let's, let's talk about that here
in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was one of, so that experiment,
you might, you might save, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few hundred dollars around on
mycorrhizal fungus, which is, is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what would be, what would be another
experiment that you ran that may have been
[SPEAKER_02]: more impactful for the facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if, are we taking cost into
consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other really, there were two big
impactful studies that I did, and I should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably say this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about doing science,
especially in a commercial facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just one person's job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole team needs to be on board and
buy into the, to the data collection
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I am no longer just a grad student who
can sit at a lab or the facility for hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on end, collecting data and making sure
that things are going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's just not the way, especially
for me being where I was, and even where I
[SPEAKER_00]: still am, I don't have the expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong or what to look
for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I asked the head grower,
you know, Gavin or Kaylin or Cheston or
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody at Goldleaf, Hey, if this is
working, what should I be looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I've never grown it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have that kind of, you know,
teamwork of, of minds, um, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you can just hire a
scientist and let him or her run crazy in
[SPEAKER_00]: some facility and collect all these data
and then come back with some report
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one's learning anything at that
point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the whole idea of this is to just
make sure that the, the, the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people, you know, everybody grows
along with the plants to understand how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make things better, uh, by just collecting
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, to get back to your question,
um, the, the first one that we trialed was
[SPEAKER_00]: adding the blue mat irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we knew that it would be an ex an
expensive addition to the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we, wanted to do our due diligence
and make sure that this wasn't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: money wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so for three trials, so three
harvests, I took, I tracked, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 beds and I looked at, um, what the
plants did in response to being irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, plain water irrigated with blue
mat systems versus hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there are six different strains
that were added into that over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of those trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, everything else was as best as we
can held constant, we controlled for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if the hand watered, uh,
beds got compost teas one day,
[SPEAKER_00]: so did the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got added right over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliars stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light cycle obviously stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things were grown across the aisle
from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we even tried to control for
microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not having plants in one corner
of the room as a test and another corner
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room as control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these things to be as close as
physically possible, with the exception of
[SPEAKER_00]: the one thing we changed, which is how did
these plants and these soils get their
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, over the course of that time,
we saw that on average, so across all six
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, we saw, um, wet weight increased
yields go up by 17.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great because not only were
we, you know, seeing more, more yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, the times that the time we
needed to have invested for labor to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and water these rooms and hand water
these rooms, um, that went away also went
[SPEAKER_00]: away was the, the variability in just
watering practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people, like I keep saying,
they really know what they're doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you're just going to have general
human variability and what somebody calls
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect or too wet or too dry or too damp,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just going to be, you know,
that variation in there, um, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: how off, how long someone's been doing
something before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we had those data, I was able to
bring this to, you know, Nate and to
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head grower there and say,
Hey guys, look, you know, after three
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds, we have these six strains,
all five, five of the six responded
[SPEAKER_00]: positively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one went down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we, when we looked at these data
and, you know, then the, the business
[SPEAKER_00]: minds kind of take over and say,
okay, well, what's the cost benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the whole facility like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does 17% to be a little conservative
look like if we're adding more yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: By that amount, how soon would we offset
the cost of retrofitting the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with a blue mat system?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we saving on labor?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those other factors that again,
are the next stage in the decision
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the data has been collected,
those wheels start turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we all ultimately come up with a
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you didn't have to do this because
ultimately what you shared right there is
[SPEAKER_02]: enough information to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moisture content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were measuring that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were, and, and so then we're able
to make just some hypothesis as to the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism, because I know this is
something, this particular topic was when
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been talking about publishing,
um, submitting the publishing on,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to an actual journal, but,
uh, you're, you're able to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuations in moisture level on the hand
watering because you don't have anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: there at two o'clock in the morning when
the plant may, when the bed may be turning
[SPEAKER_02]: out slightly to add, add more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the great thing too, the
mechanism again, going back to this for
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue mat is what the blue mat is,
what the blue mat is sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensors are actually looking at is the
millibar, the soil, the pressure of water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's within, you know, the tension of
the water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when you have all these
other irrigation systems that run off of
[SPEAKER_00]: timers, um, you know, those are certainly
better for saving at labor, but a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't know what a Thursday is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the same thing we were
dealing with, uh, with handwriting or you
[SPEAKER_00]: had, and then that's the right approach,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have consistent regimented watering
days, but especially again, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with genetics, multiple genetics
in a single room, the scientifically sound
[SPEAKER_00]: approach would be to water each bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same amount, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This bed gets five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bed, for example, gets five gallons,
this bed, but to sit there and think,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this bed's got one strain,
strain A and this strain in the adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: bed is strain B.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, if you give both of those five
gallons of water, you may be severely
[SPEAKER_00]: under watering or over watering one of
those strains, depending on just their
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the blue mat allowed us to do was
it would, it allowed us to put the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the driver's seat to say,
okay, look, I really like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to just be chugging along
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't have to worry about adding
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw strains that ran much
drier than we were really comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: going with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the soil surface itself started
cracking in between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the drip tape was and we got,
oh gosh, is this okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd go and take a moisture meeting
and sure enough, it was holding right at
[SPEAKER_00]: around 80 to a hundred millibars where it
was kind of the target zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesized, uh, to be, um,
and it, and it, and it worked out well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's another thing to talk about
though, is let's say it hadn't worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we say that blue mats don't work or
can we say that maybe we need to try it at
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 millibar or 120 millibar or maybe that
one particular cultivar slash strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, actually would, uh, prefers wetter or
drier soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's still questions to be
asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of the outcome of your trial,
but in this case it was, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: apparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: 17% is a great increase in wet weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just as a small plug here,
uh, Ben actually does custom blue mat
[SPEAKER_02]: designs through kiss now for people who
want to set up a trial or outfit their
[SPEAKER_02]: facility with blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's done tons of them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have a little bit of a unique
design that we've actually got data to
[SPEAKER_02]: support, which I feel really good about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't hesitate to reach out if that's
something people are interested in trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now, um, I don't want this to be all
just about blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just something that worked really
well for you guys with beds in a facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and is a great example of how you can
increase yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 17% increase you're able to implement
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge increase in your facility
and a massive decrease in labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, watering is such a big labor suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think, you know, just to say
something positive about blue mats,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea that, uh, you have a tensiometer
measuring in every bed, what that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: needs is really great because like you
said, one, one cultivar may want less
[SPEAKER_02]: water than the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have an irrigation system on
a timer, there's, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe slightly better than hand watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll save on labor, but it doesn't
address the, I, I, I'm a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Tuesday mean to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tuesdays, what is a Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need this right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a microbial perspective,
keeping the soil evenly moist is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase, uh, optimal, optimal microbial,
uh, growth and activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a win-win all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll again, the, the night,
the nice thing too, about not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: result, but was, it was how the experiment
worked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a big decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we took a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out that sweet spot for how
much data we would need to make this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't trust really anything other
than what the plants showed us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the underlying theme
that I hope a lot of folks can maybe take
[SPEAKER_00]: away from this is you'll hear so many
different people and read so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, uh, even me or gold leaf,
like this works for us and what you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from somebody else either worked or did
not work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best indicator again, is going to
be that if you're growing in living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that dipstick, the plant itself,
if it looks at the plant and let the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you if it's working or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to sacrifice really all
that much to start collecting just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of data on these plants that
will then give you so much more confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: on whether or not to make an inexpensive
move or, or an expensive one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the next experiment that you
guys tried?
[SPEAKER_02]: Child over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got blue mats fully implemented and
that took a little bit of time and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some, you know, it was a new system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to do some training and there
were a couple of kinks who worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I was putting the sensors too
close to the drip tape and it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: having the thermostat, you know,
too close to the AC vent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was, there's a couple of
different things that we had to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other thing that,
you know, science is you're never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do something, expect to change
it, not too much, you know, it's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: much down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so once we had all that dialed in and
we were seeing these, these yields get
[SPEAKER_00]: better and the labor costs went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we then started hypothesizing,
well, the plants now have adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pretty sure that based on soil
tests, you know, working with you and an
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment recipes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew the nutrients were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew the irrigation was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last, you know, kind of piece to the
trifecta was, well, are we limiting these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with their photosynthetic ability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we not giving them, they got the
access to the nutrients, the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, but what about the stuff that
comes from the ceiling?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we were watching the lighting
market for that, for all of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is booming in a way that's
almost tough to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like trying to jump into a raging
river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we went to a conference,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with, we were there with you and we
started really thinking about this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning, um, gold leaf over to led
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, up until that point, they were
using, you know, thousand watt Kavita HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went with that same approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of testing just a few beds, just a few
beds worse of space under different
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting companies, excuse me,
that were, you know, reputable somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: new somewhere, you know, been around for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we wanted to see how these,
um, these different lighting companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they, how it influenced our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that yields are obviously one
of the major pieces to the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into lighting and
starting to change spectrums, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're starting to then get into
actual chemical expression, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to track that data as best we
could as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this next experiment, it was a
little bit more of an analysis task where
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't just go for wet weight,
but we went for dry weight as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make sure that the yields we
were seeing weren't just in the stocks and
[SPEAKER_00]: the leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but actually in the sellable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to do terpene testing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to make sure that,
yeah, that we grew more of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was, you know, way less potent or
the flavors were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all different questions we
had, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect dry weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect the wet weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it affect the terpene expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those questions right there
automatically steered us to the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: direct, the kind of data we knew we needed
to collect to make this kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, uh, drum roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give them some, let's give them some
of the answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys found, uh, you know,
without calling out any one company,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, over another, in terms of the LED
results, can you at least share what some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the variability was without naming
names?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and I should step back to before
we even got to that phase, we knew very
[SPEAKER_00]: much ahead of time that this would not be
a grab it all at once, throw it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were a facility like us and you
wanted to know, well, I've got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of money and I'd like to start to make
this transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do those LEDs most benefit you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the preliminary experiment we ran was
introducing LEDs at various stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some mothers placed under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some of our early transplanted
clones under LEDs, and we had some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to have some real fun by
crisscrossing these different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean is, let's say, for example,
you had a plant that was grown in a cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: or so let's go before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother was under an LED and then it
was put in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the, the clipping was put in the
cloner came out and then that clipping
[SPEAKER_00]: went under LED and then it was
transplanted under LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see at any one of those
different stages, aside from the cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could go differently,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if the mother came from HPS,
then the clone went to HPS, but then went
[SPEAKER_00]: straight into LED and all of those
different possible combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested all of those and we found
something pretty interesting, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you started out with a clone
under an LED and you moved it to HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was extremely unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you started a clone out under
HPS and moved it into an LED, it seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it did about the same as an HPS
to an HPS, a clone to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best of course was when we saw the LED
clone, the LED mother and the LED flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you had all three of those,
we saw the best yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first little nugget we had
as far as, okay, well, if we do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we definitely know we need to put them in
the flower rooms first, because if we put
[SPEAKER_00]: them anywhere else, then we're actually
going to be hurting ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where to put the LEDs was a question
whether or not we were going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we did that and we found that all
three LED companies we tested fared,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can say significantly better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the data to actually we ran the
tests significantly better than the HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: output, the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks would say, well,
that's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we took it a little bit further
and actually looked at, well, what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: wattage use here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much, you know, what's the cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many grams per light or are we getting
is the normal metric, but also how many
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per watt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you put in there is money
going away versus what you're getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we looked at that, we found that
there was a bit of a difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the LED companies as far as how much
energy it was going to take for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the same gram of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also looked at cost per unit,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one more factor as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing I want to mention is I
believe when you transition from one
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting spectrum to another, it's really
important to dial back those lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially switching from HPS to LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that something that you guys
addressed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear a lot of people burning their
plants because they don't take that into
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is so much more intensely
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's both a good thing and a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were trying to do a total one for
one changeover for basically every light
[SPEAKER_00]: where we had an HPS, we were going to put
an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that and we saw really good
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have to dial things down a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having, again, a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were talking about blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not an expensive tool,
but they can give you great data to make
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this LED project, we had a little
PAR meter, which is just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation to
look and see, well, jeez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's not the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For LEDs, but it is a great quick tool to
have on hand to say, oh, my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these these lights are pumping
out significantly more photons at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point at this height relative to what the
HPS are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should kind of dial it back a
little bit and ramp them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually something we haven't
quite tested yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we do do that, but we haven't
really got into the into the fun of,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what if we started out at 20 and
after three weeks we raise it to 35,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another dial there that we're
still looking to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that's kind of to
watch out for, if you do make the switch,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that footprint is so severely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those HPS lights, they're like
floodlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang them high in the ceiling and
you get a really great cast of light
[SPEAKER_00]: across a really large square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lighting power density,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But with these LEDs, especially some of
these manufacturers now are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: putting little lenses on each individual
diode, which better focuses the light
[SPEAKER_00]: straight down, which is great for canopy
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're you're going to be limiting,
you know, your your throw distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, your your kind of fall off is
going to be extremely severe when you
[SPEAKER_00]: switch from an HPS to an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, we could have an HPS
above two, maybe even three beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd all get about the same par.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second you put, let's say,
for example, that's an LED fitting above
[SPEAKER_00]: that middle bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you got halfway between the
bed to the left and to the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was getting almost no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this, you know, is something someone's
considering, you know, you may need to up
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of lights per square foot to
make sure you compensate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going from a wide angle
to a very narrow zoom and kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just say that I think every
commercial facility should have a par
[SPEAKER_02]: meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's like 250 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have them on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that expensive, relatively
speaking to what you're spending on your
[SPEAKER_02]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know they're certainly not
expensive relative to the lights you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be buying if that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been to facilities where their
lights were either too far away or too
[SPEAKER_02]: close and they didn't have a par meter and
they weren't really missing out on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, an entire crop cycle where they
were either under or massively over
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, even if you borrow or rent
one from a buddy for a little while or
[SPEAKER_02]: keep one amongst a group of people,
so you can at least figure out what that
[SPEAKER_02]: level is with your lights in your
facility, I think is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not complicated stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you turn the thing on,
you hold a little sensor under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had mine glued to a meter stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not glued, but, you know,
taped to a meter stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew exactly what the distance from
the floor was at canopy height,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could actually get, well,
you know, I could get two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would know the distance from the
floor to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would know the distance from
the floor to the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I subtracted those distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have the distance from the light to
the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could look at par and those,
you know, that kind of curve and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, look, you know, if we get this
close, we're going to be into a danger
[SPEAKER_00]: zone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we get this far away, then we're
really not even maximizing the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: using these things at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that kind of sweet spot or
Goldilocks zone, as a lot of folks like to
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the only way to find that is to
just collect the data, use the par meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a, you know, measuring tape or even a
PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a known distance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut a six foot long piece of PVC and
there's your measuring stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's ways to do things that
are really not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data is extremely powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking at a chart here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at a couple of charts that you
sent me that are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of which I published on our Instagram
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to, it looks like January of
2019 to July of 2020, you're showing an
[SPEAKER_02]: over a 300% increase in wet weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm doing the math correctly here in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is a 300% increase if you're
looking at our low lowest harvest to what
[SPEAKER_00]: our highest harvest is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from 2019 to currently, and I just
checked the numbers for August,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually up 57% on average for our
harvest weights, which is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've done this with, you know,
less labor because of the blue mat system
[SPEAKER_02]: that you set up and improved, essentially
improved SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then as you guys make a change,
these things get added into your SOPs and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you move forward to answer the next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody gets trained up and is
encouraged to think of other questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, I'm not in the flower
rooms every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are, they're with the flowers,
you know, they're with the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're with the soil, they're with the
blue mats, they're with the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing things, you know,
they're again, the fishermen of the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the gardeners in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones there every day and their
observations, which again, is the nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: for the scientific process are invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really encouraging growers or even
volunteers, whoever is in any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity working at any facility to openly
observe and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there is again, invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In starting this whole process of making
things better over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not every experiment you guys ran was
a success.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them never even completed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I try and vet people before I send
them to you guys because I know the time
[SPEAKER_02]: and expense that goes into running a
trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple of years ago, there was a
particular microbial product that they had
[SPEAKER_02]: sourced out of, I think, the vet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they came down and sprayed some of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The experiment kind of fell apart due to
timing and availability because they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to be the ones doing the
applications and they can only make it
[SPEAKER_02]: down certain times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't believe you guys noticed
anything statistically wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not statistically significant either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a biotech company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to call them out anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came down and it was great to work
with them though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came down and they were looking to
see if this treatment or this product that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had was going to be effective with
cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked alongside them in our bedrooms
and our flower rooms and it just never
[SPEAKER_00]: really developed to the point where we saw
any significant difference or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-significant difference at that point
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methodology didn't work out in such a
way, like you said, where simply the
[SPEAKER_00]: logistics of having them come down and
take data or have me take the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: they needed, it just didn't line up and it
just kind of fizzled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to that, and if you want to hear my
thoughts around and Suzanne's thoughts,
[SPEAKER_02]: check out the podcast about evaluating a
product because those are the things you
[SPEAKER_02]: should go into before you're ever
considering bringing something in your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they were saying to us regarding the
product and what they believed it would do
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty astounding really.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some science.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't just a bunch of guys that
were salesmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some good scientific background.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it just didn't pan out in this
case and that's not to say it's a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: product or a bad company, but it allowed
Goldleaf to make a decision about whether
[SPEAKER_02]: or not it was something that they wanted
to use in the facility and allowed me at
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiss Organics to make a decision of
whether it was a product that we wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer to our customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every test is successful and even the
unsuccessful ones will teach you something
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't spend all day measuring
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where it's really important to
dial in on what it is you want to measure,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you're going to measure it,
and just collect the information that you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to make a good decision for your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking to that, one of my favorite
tools in the scientific tool chest is this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing called a graphical hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exactly what it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you making a hypothesis in a graph
form, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you're comparing two
treatments, that would be like a bar
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have treatment A versus
treatment B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would say, come harvest,
A would look like this, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, and B would look like this,
a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there is such a north star
because it tells you everything you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of data do I need to collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much data do I need to collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do I need to collect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things will ultimately need
to be addressed to get you to that graph
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just made before you even spent a
dime or committed any of your facility to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this kind of a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to look at something over
time, yield over time, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know on the x-axis or the horizontal
axis, that's always going to be time,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dependent variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis is your, I'm sorry,
your independent variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dependent variable is on the x and
your y is your dependent variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the response you're measuring is going
to depend on time, it always does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield over time or anything else that
goes over time, you could set these graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally what I used to do,
I would just pin it to my wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would look at that every day and
say, okay, what do I need to do to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: this graph?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, what you're doing as a
hypothesis is completely hypothetical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the framework of it is very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data, what the line looks like,
what the bars look like, what the scatter
[SPEAKER_00]: plot looks like, what the heat map looks
like, any of these other crazy analyses
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get into, that's going to change
because that's going to actually be real
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it's set up, the axes,
the scale maybe, certainly the units is a
[SPEAKER_00]: big one you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I looking at grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I looking at kilograms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I looking at pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I looking at gallons, cubic feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these little things have messed up
a lot of very expensive experiments in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, not from us, but just in science in
general, like just these little overlooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more time you can think and plan
and ask questions and refine before you
[SPEAKER_00]: take that first step, the better your data
is going to be, the cheaper it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cost you to run it because you're going to
be avoiding all of these pitfalls already
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just going to have really a fun
time doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to not know something and
then know a way to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back to my other example,
how to get that light bulb back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the things you touched on
there is confounding variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions you're asking
yourself is what could screw up this
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment?
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I able to control for?
[SPEAKER_02]: So are the lights going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the soil going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in this case with living soil,
well, shoot, there's no way we can measure
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a black box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess we could get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've already done podcasts talking
about how variable and accurate those can
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just say we want to measure
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're saying when we take living
soils, for example, in the trials that you
[SPEAKER_02]: ran, we're saying that that's our control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our control is whatever that soil is at
right now today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not measuring that necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're keeping that the same across the
trial itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be making a little bit
of an assumption, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to assume that because you
have not done anything different to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in bed A versus the soil in bed B,
they get the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the same amount of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the same ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not the communities are the
same or not, again, you're going back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: six year PhD type project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do everything you can to say we
haven't changed this variable,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil is the soil is consistent across
the treatment because it's gotten now,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's being held at the same M bar of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting the same amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting, you know, added the same
mix, the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bed is getting treated identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to assume that those
communities are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK to do because, again,
like you said, to find out how much
[SPEAKER_00]: different that would be beta diversity,
the difference between two different
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, you're going to be looking
at, I think it's beta diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be looking at microscopes
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very useful, Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to use HPLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to add to that, though,
is we can compare soils, which actually we
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are currently doing right now between,
I guess we could call it kiss organics
[SPEAKER_02]: soils versus gold leaf soil, which is kiss
organics biochar soil that's now seven or
[SPEAKER_02]: eight years old through however many
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really excited to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hypothesis was that we would beat
the gold leaf soil and yields on the new
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, potentially on the second crop,
if not on the first one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I know that the soil is old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know through the years we tried a
lot of stuff with gold leaf and amendments
[SPEAKER_02]: and inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though you guys have been doing
some soil testing and balancing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: my opinion was, well, starting over after
that period of time could potentially out
[SPEAKER_02]: yield what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a slightly different hypothesis,
which you can share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can share some of the
preliminary results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what was wrong with those
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hypothesis, and again, this is just
for me having my nose in ecology books for
[SPEAKER_00]: the past six years, is there's a couple of
different things happening as communities
[SPEAKER_00]: get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the common things to think about
is a rainforest, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rainforests are viewed as very
diverse, overarching, old growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of things going on, lots of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that forest was young,
it obviously didn't look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees take a long time to get super big.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they take a long time sometimes
to just recruit to the area to get super
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community composition changes over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an ecological term called
succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would imagine, again, another
example, if a lake were to dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, you wouldn't see a forest
shoot up straight away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be small little plants,
things that would be very good at dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with lots of water, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe things that are really good at
dealing with crazy salinity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as those plants establish those
pioneer plants, it'll allow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: recruitment of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, this biodiversity builds up
and you get these communities that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of niche space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential for other
organisms to start to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like the new Hawaiian islands
that are getting built as we speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bare lava rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants we see there first settle
are wildly different than the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are there decades, generations,
centuries into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hypothesis was that we have this
community that we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: With and over time, I think we might be we
might be growing towards this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: older growth rainforest, quote unquote,
of a soil community that's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trophic chain is much more developed,
meaning the relationships between these
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and these organisms are much
more well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity could very well be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be having a lot more
microbes, bacteria, earthworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different players in that arena
that physically couldn't exist earlier on
[SPEAKER_00]: because the community just wasn't built to
support that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one reason why I thought gold
leaf may do just as well, if not maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even better than than the new kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say gold leaf, again,
really, we just mean we're just testing
[SPEAKER_00]: old gold, old kiss versus new kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another really fun
ecological term called or a hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's been tested and it's got its
shares of criticisms and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's called the intermediate
disturbance hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one was put forth by an
experiment that's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about a rocky intertidal,
right, you've got small rocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium rocks and these big boulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a wave comes and hits the shore,
a small rock is going to be disturbed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get thrown all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, not a whole lot of
organisms are going to want to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A boulder, on the other hand, when a big
wave comes, it's not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, the most dominant species
that can settle there will likely
[SPEAKER_00]: outcompete anything else that's trying to
get a foothold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diversity is not it's going to be
better than, you know, what you have at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning with nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it won't be as good as what you would
expect to find on the middle sized rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that rock is just about right to
the point where when a wave comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be a big wave to really knock
everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't, it allows for the
communities to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every now and then, a wave will come
and it'll knock everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is doing is it's allowing the
diversity to increase to a point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but gets disturbed at an intermediate,
hence the name of the theory, at an
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate time scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those really good species that out
competing and killing off other species,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting placed in check by this
abiotic interference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be able to
establish the community level that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would had they not have this perturbation,
this disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my other thinking was the reason we
might see Old Kiss soil, the gold leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, be a little bit better is because
after every round, we kind of do a reset
[SPEAKER_00]: on the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting this disturbance
intermediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting these communities to
build up, build up, build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the hypothesis here,
I would take a long time to figure this
[SPEAKER_00]: out if this was actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I, a plausible explanation would
be before those communities get so well
[SPEAKER_00]: established to the point where the,
you know, the little microbes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really good at, let's say cycling,
you know, phosphorus or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't get out competed because we
reset the system before they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think people might not know what
you're talking about when you say you
[SPEAKER_02]: reset the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're adding a disturbance,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if a hurricane were to come
in to that rainforest and wipe the slate
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, you'd have some old growth left,
but you'd also then have those new
[SPEAKER_00]: settlement, those new pioneering species
come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, your diversity is
actually much greater than what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was all just old growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's another way of increasing
the biodiversity of the community by just
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing it in such a way that it
doesn't allow the main competitors to gain
[SPEAKER_00]: a foothold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are running a little bit of
water through there to reduce sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you amend you, you do what people
would call till, I guess, in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's light, but you're mixing
nutrients back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are forms of disturbance of the
soil, which is exactly describing rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than running a cover crop or a mulch that
doesn't allow you to mix nutrients in
[SPEAKER_02]: homogeneously, which is probably a whole
other conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were the results and what
conclusions can we really draw from them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the experimental setup
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three strains we wanted to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just call them A, B, and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, we then had eight plants in each
bed and we had three different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the old kiss soil, which is
technically the control, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what gold leaf is typically always,
is always growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tests, then we tested that versus
the biochar soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Against the commercial growers mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had nine beds in total for this
trial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three strains, three beds a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took it upon ourselves to measure
the wet weight and dry weight of each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant individually, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I wanted to make sure we had
some statistical power here to get at,
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to pick up any signal we possibly
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having three data points
that were the average of eight or the
[SPEAKER_00]: summation of eight plants, I cut each
individual plant out of there and measured
[SPEAKER_00]: it individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing so far, again,
it's a super preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even ran the stats on it yet,
but we are seeing that the older soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: outperforming biochar and commercial
growers new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, is it statistically significant at
this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit of variation in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, for strain A,
you'll get a plant that weighs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 0.36 pounds, but you'll also get
a plant in that same bed that will weigh
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.1 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of fluctuation in the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have big variation like that,
it's really hard to test and, and find
[SPEAKER_00]: significance unless you go with a lot of
data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing a little bit better
yields coming out of, of the oldest soil
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's oldest soil we're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, it's not like the biochar
and the commercial growers, both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: soils hit the average or just about hit
the average, sometimes surpass the average
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the gold leaf soil was producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not talking about extremely large
jumps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way of saying that is let's say
a gold leaf plant weighed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.2 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen both commercial growers and
biochar also have plants that weighed that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's you know, there's some
variability where we, we just harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: another room that we ran the same trial
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were trying to, again, start looking
for patterns and crossing off some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some controls, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just that room this time where that
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just these strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're repeating some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding some new strains to see if we
can find that signal and all of this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of background noise of, of all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like if you take good care of
KISS soil, it only, it's like a fine wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only gets better with age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, this doesn't hurt my feelings
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want people to reuse soil and we want
to know that the soil is still viable in
[SPEAKER_02]: this case, seven or eight years later,
which is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of savings on, you know,
buying soil over that time, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, paid for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's, what's funny to me in this,
and you kind of shared this with me after
[SPEAKER_02]: giving me the numbers was the beds,
I guess, were not the equal volume of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't draw every conclusion from
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that the KISS soil beds,
some of them were low, had lower volume of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil than the ground-leaf soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a confounding variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it absolutely would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, this next trial that we're doing
now, we just transplanted, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we grabbed some more soil and we,
we measured it out and we're controlling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're controlling now for soil depth to
make sure that that can't not,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is eliminated as a confounding
variable that may impact the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I, what I would love to say in
all of this, in terms of what conclusions
[SPEAKER_02]: we can draw, one thing, you know,
that we can look at here just by measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: wet weight and dry weight is that you guys
don't need to replace your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not at the moment, a limiting factor
of growth, assuming that we're setting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, new soil from KISS as the
control in that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're still performing at or
above that level, which exactly,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would allow you to make a
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to, do I need to reset the soil
or are we good to keep using the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which saves a ton of money for gold leaf
and cost KISS some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, from a, just from a
sustainability standpoint, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: to not even have to worry about,
you know, things like nutrient runoff and
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it's just a, it's just a more
holistic way of gardening, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing cannabis or anything else is,
you know, just to keep reusing your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, it's a great feeling to
not think that you're just turning through
[SPEAKER_00]: something that, you know, if you,
you know, take care of it, it'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll keep you fed and among other things
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think folks can do this across
different soil recipes and soil brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not just about obviously my
company or our soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could compare different companies,
soil or different recipes of soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways of reamending your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all things that any facility
could look at and draw decisions on where
[SPEAKER_02]: people get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion is where they start making a
whole bunch of changes all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people, I get this question all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what should I add to the soil to
maximize my yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually tell people, unless they're
in like a five or seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which case I say you may have to add
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you may want to, you know, add more,
you know, consider a larger container
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on your crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, my, my answer every time
is just go with one pot with just water or
[SPEAKER_02]: one container or one bed, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you get an idea of how the
soil performs as a control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you want to start adding in other
things, you know, we didn't even talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about mammoth pee in that trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably touch on that real
quick before we sign off as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, we have to have an
understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start adding all these different
things, all these inputs into the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the soil does really well,
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're locked in doing all these
inputs and not really knowing what the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling variable was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in a worst case scenario, the soil
totally fails you and your plant looks
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know if it was, if you can blame
the soil company or if you can blame your
[SPEAKER_02]: water or the 50 other things that you did
to the soil during the crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back to the simple,
your burnt out light bulb example,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be synonymous to saying, okay,
I'm going to replace the switch,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wiring, the light bulb, the light
fixture, all at the same time before I try
[SPEAKER_00]: it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't address everything at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can, but you'd have to pretty
much devote all of your facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a couple more to answer all the
questions individually that you need to at
[SPEAKER_00]: a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just one thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, things are always, you know,
not to drop the name of the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keeping it simple really is the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if something goes wrong,
you know what you did as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I changed this, this, this,
and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have to go back
and say, well, was it this, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, or this, or if something goes great
and you want to replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you need to know what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually caused that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were saying, like you might be
adding, if you added five things into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, your plants shot up like rockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if four of those were a total
waste of time and money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other confounding variable that we
hadn't talked about, but people need to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider is pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have root aphids come in on a
crop cycle, you know, for just as,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the canvas aphid, that's going to
affect your numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really, in a lot of ways,
challenges or ruins an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep all of those things in the
back of your head as you're setting up an
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't talked to Ben about this,
but I'm going to throw this out on the air
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a commercial facility and you
want help setting up a trial in one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: soils or something, reach out to us and
we'll help you with the methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, make sure you guys are on
the right track so you can start testing
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the more data points we can collect
as an industry, the better, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I really hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, folks take away from this is
if we get everybody to be just more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident in collecting their own data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not expecting everyone to start doing
crazy statistical analysis and looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: significance and P values and F values and
T tests and all these crazy things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you get to learn eventually,
but simply just looking at how much
[SPEAKER_00]: something adds up or the average of
something is incredibly informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if there's a big decision
you need to make doing it slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it first is always going to save
you money because you're just not taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, if, if I could just,
just get everybody more confident and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and have fun with it,
you know, it's, it's investigations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how does this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's one of our basic interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inquiries is human beings as why is this
this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can do that, um, for growing
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we talked about the mammoth P trial
that you guys ran, uh, on the last podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: I did with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you just happen to know the percentage
of yield increase?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can, I can post that or we can
post that once I look that up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say we were somewhere in the 20%
range somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like maybe a little bit less 15,
20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look to get the number
exactly, but I just don't have it in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this was in your, you know,
what we're calling gold leaf soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is older soil, living soil that's
been managed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, these were the yields you saw in your
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say you can expect that
across the board, but to me that if I
[SPEAKER_02]: heard this and looked at your methodology
and it looked somewhat sound, I would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, this is worth trying out in my
facility to see if I can get similar
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I do, then it's worth a cost
benefit analysis to make that,
[SPEAKER_02]: make that addition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the kinds of things I look
for when I start reading about the
[SPEAKER_02]: research or results that other people are
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's like you said,
it's extremely important to remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is obviously no matter what I say or
anybody else says it's a case by case,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's not a case by case is data
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep harping on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if you want to know something,
measuring something is synonymous across
[SPEAKER_00]: the board with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going to tell you if
somebody else's system or somebody else's
[SPEAKER_00]: product or somebody else's suggestion will
work for you and your facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your employees, your workflows,
your SOPs, all of that will be determined
[SPEAKER_00]: or can be determined by just collecting
the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what trials do we have to look forward
to from you in the future here with gold
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know a couple off the top of my head
that I'm looking forward to, to trialing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what, uh, anything that you're excited
about right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, we've got another couple of
products we want to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, like I said, we want to start
dialing in the LEDs a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple of different,
uh, soil mixes we might be working on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future here that we want to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and really just making,
trying to keep that, that, that line on
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you and I are talking about some
more sustainable options down the road to
[SPEAKER_02]: move towards things that are, uh,
more sustainably produced potentially,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which I'm really excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, uh, a microbial product that,
uh, I haven't told you about yet that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to, uh, potentially do some trials
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're looking at things around heavy
metals right now and heavy metal uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: and how do we, how do we, how do we reduce
or, uh, with a lot more confidence
[SPEAKER_02]: guarantee based on the testing that people
are dealing with right now that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're not going to fail for heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and what inputs are most affecting,
uh, those results, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm trying to think what else off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one of the experiments I'm super
excited to try, uh, once I finish
[SPEAKER_02]: remodeling my garage and get a legal
certificate with, uh, uh, with the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can grow legally again, uh,
at my place is I want to show a trial of
[SPEAKER_02]: just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants with the same, same genetics,
same soil, just watered at different M
[SPEAKER_02]: bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't think people realize how
important water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a blue mat system and
set one up at 40 M bar, one at 60,
[SPEAKER_02]: one at 80, one at a hundred, you know,
all the way through to like, let's say
[SPEAKER_02]: 180, 200 M bar and just show people how
much just hydrology, just watering can
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the health and growth of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause so many times people will post these
pictures of plants, you know, with
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies or toxicities, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like a lot of the times it's
just watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, you know, if you are working
with living soil, like we all love to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's really easy to think
about, well, you have these different
[SPEAKER_00]: components and this makes my plant grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your soil, you have your
lighting, you have your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your irrigation, these things
make my plant grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, it's all of those things
working or not working together is what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes your plant grow or not grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you dial in one thing,
it's not like the other things aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to keep an eye on, well,
I changed this, but holding irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: constant, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're saying, if we had a trial
with a bunch of different beds and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all being constantly held at the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: M bar, we can confidently say the only
thing that's changing here is not just
[SPEAKER_00]: here is just the irrigation in such a
sense that we, we know that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be really cool at the end of
that time, now that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you've got my wheel spinning,
you know, to actually see if we can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue test and a soil test to see what 's
getting pulled out of that soil relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the different soil moisture that that
plant was exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one hypothesis would be if you're
sitting at 200 M bar, the, the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: and elemental makeup of that plant is
going to look different than a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown at a hundred M bar, even though
they had access to the exact same medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because I'll see soil tests
from clients sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can usually tell if they're using
our soil, if they had a flood event at one
[SPEAKER_02]: point in time during their cycle,
just based on how the test looks,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I can tell if their water is,
you know, really high in calcium or the pH
[SPEAKER_02]: is high on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that are usually
pretty easy to spot from a soil test just
[SPEAKER_02]: based on that, like, like you're
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it'll be fun to set that up as an
experiment as a visual kind of experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: for people to see what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to future research and I
look forward to seeing what other research
[SPEAKER_02]: other people are doing out there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, there's a lot of cannabis
research being done right now and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping more and more people will share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're listening to this and you're
a, you're a grad student or a professor by
[SPEAKER_02]: chance, or even a facility that feels like
they have a good handle on scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: method and you're getting results,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to share them on the podcast too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of a unique position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the exciting, like rarely
in science do you, and I, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of stumbled into this position
where you find this completely untapped
[SPEAKER_00]: field, you know, just an open question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not to being said that a lot of
work hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously people have been
growing and talking and for centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not longer, but you know,
as far as from an academic and scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, the normal kind of avenues to
scientific investigation and discovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in our country has, we're closed
up until now they're just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: open, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like government funding or,
uh, research institutes like universities
[SPEAKER_00]: or colleges, none of those things or which
are the normal pathways for discovery were
[SPEAKER_00]: open to cannabis because of the federal
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are kind of depending on,
you know, facilities and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and research scientists and,
and again, growers with a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience to all work together,
uh, in kind of a, almost a privatized,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, collective to, to really
advance, you know, the growing of this
[SPEAKER_00]: product, um, into the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think people have to be afraid
to share things because, uh, at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day, like, you know, someone running,
you know, eight year old soil with blue
[SPEAKER_02]: mats and using, let's say our,
you know, mammoth pee or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever stuff worked for Goldleaf,
there's still, they don't have Goldleaf's
[SPEAKER_02]: branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have Goldleaf's growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have Goldleaf's SLPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a lot more that goes into
running a commercial facility than just a
[SPEAKER_02]: few products or a soil or any of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I hear people say they don't want
to share their data because they're giving
[SPEAKER_02]: away, you know, trade secrets,
um, are things that are proprietary to
[SPEAKER_02]: their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, like there are
instances where that would be true,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in a lot of cases, I think if we share
this data, we're just improving ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: as an industry and helping us all be
successful and potentially compete with
[SPEAKER_02]: big, big egg here down the road is real
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: As some may call it, we'll start coming
into this, uh, into this industry as,
[SPEAKER_02]: if, as it already has been shown to start
happening.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ben, well, this has turned into
a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I can talk to you forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're, we're friends,
we're coworkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is the stuff we enjoy talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, let's go ahead and sign off for
today, but thank you so much for your
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing, uh, what future
research comes on down the road for you
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, gold leaf and kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Dr. Ben Higgins, chief research
scientist with gold leaf gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to the Canada's
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted the papers and research we
discussed on the podcast on our website
[SPEAKER_02]: blog page.
