[SPEAKER_00]: So I recently visited Collective Elevation
in Bozeman, Montana and I saw that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had these awesome rolling beds in the
trays and I asked them about how they
[SPEAKER_00]: built these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they created these unistret
frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of some fixed ones that
they sent me also for this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to try and make a rolling
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also from them as well,
the rolling one that they did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my first attempt was an utter failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not build it correctly and so I
wanted to make this video to kind of show
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys what I did wrong and how to do it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first stop was Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get everything you need there with
the exception of the tray or flood tables
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else I got came from Home Depot
and this is an example of the unistret
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step was cutting everything to
the proper size that I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me I found the grinder worked the best
but if you're handy you may have other
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try a metal blade in my miter saw as
well but whatever you decide to do make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you use proper protective gear
for cutting all the metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a few different ways to attach
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with these spring nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I did it I did not use
these and it failed miserably so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a good step up and in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing with them that is a little
bit tricky is you kind of have to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: them, put pressure up, get everything in
position and then add the bolt and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pushing down against the tension of
the spring which is a little bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie this took me a little
bit to get it right and this was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a hassle because you're you're
pushing up with like in here I'm pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: up with my left hand pushing down with my
right hand and then trying to tighten the
[SPEAKER_00]: socket at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you do get it started it becomes
pretty easy and then you can adjust it and
[SPEAKER_00]: line everything up just the way you want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does hold really securely once you
have it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have access or the ability to
use these you know and you have a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: socket set I definitely think that's the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so once you've built out the basic
frame like you saw before I added these
[SPEAKER_00]: casters that I had picked up at Harbor
Freight a while back and so I put those on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're attached at two points from
underneath and this was the way I put on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put on six wheels altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also want to give a shout out to
Greg Larson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with another design using these
connectors and he's using this in his
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's able to get three connections then
with his casters and one recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: that he did make that I thought was a good
one was to use larger casters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I didn't do and if I
could go back and rebuild it I totally
[SPEAKER_00]: would because once I got the soil in there
after building this bed it was frankly
[SPEAKER_00]: really really heavy and hard to move with
that much soil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put about a yard and a half of total
soil on here once I was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you guys this is what
it looked like with the tray on there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is what it looks like today with
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to move but because I don't
have to move it very far I'm just moving
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be moving it very often it's
just when I prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is gonna work out great for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope this helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for watching.
you
