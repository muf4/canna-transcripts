[SPEAKER_00]: So what you've got anatomy right here on
this apple, if you can make anything out,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this is the bud scale scars from last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has grown this much all the way to
the end this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farther it gets away from,
the farther this apical meristem gets away
[SPEAKER_00]: from last year's growth, last year's
growth starts to grow spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you encourage spurs on
apple trees is letting the apical meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: get away, get farther away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all fruit spurs right
here, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this tree will grow fruit spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so next year, this will have fruit on
these spurs because a spur by definition
[SPEAKER_00]: is a short and compressed stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really built for fruit production
and built for fruit weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mistake people make is they see
this big shoot coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By cutting it here, it removes the apical
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys say, oh, look, we're going
to sprout, we're going to sprout,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once it sprouts, you don't get any
spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to encourage spur production in
fruit trees is to let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once a spur, once it forms a spur,
it always has that spur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I could go back and I could cut it
to here and these spurs would not turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into vegetative shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would stay a spur and you would have
spur growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have stocky growth and it would
support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get away from this type of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what should have happened here or what
will happen here eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have thinned these, but also
these will be cut back so that this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: strong enough to hold all of weight like
this and not let it continue to hang down
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
So that's the way to do it.
