[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Suzanne Wainwright
Evans.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on biological control and using
pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, nurseries, landscapers,
and interior scape companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the owner of Bug Lady Consulting,
now in business for over 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you missed my first interviews with
her, I highly suggest you start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne reached out again because she
wanted to come back on to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting and other topics that she's
noticed have been issues for many cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers on her farm visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder, if you are a large-scale
commercial cultivator and are serious
[SPEAKER_01]: about consulting or setting up an
integrated pest management program
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing beneficial insects, I can't
recommend her enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her website is www.bugladyconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a small grower, then I suggest
you try to attend one of her upcoming
[SPEAKER_01]: lectures or workshops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about a couple in the show and
I'll have links to them along with other
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Suzanne, thanks for coming back on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure what we're talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had reached out saying there was a
bunch of stuff you'd come across in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last year since we last chatted on air and
wanted to share it with listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, thanks for having me back
again and not that I forced you to have me
[SPEAKER_00]: on, but I just thought it would be a good
idea to come back and talk about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I'm seeing going on as I travel
around the country working with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers of all different sizes,
which is actually good because the other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, you've gotten me in touch with a
lot of other growers around the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've had some great discussions over
some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the biggest things I'm finding
when I'm actually at physically at
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities is that growers really don't
know how to look to find their pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: to know really what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a lot of assumptions and
a lot of guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not as simple as,
oh, you can snap a quick picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it up on Facebook and have somebody
idea it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers really need to have a good,
solid scouting program that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: system to it so that they can be
consistent, they can keep records and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to put together a good, solid program
because I am seeing a lot of waste in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of people are spraying when they
don't need to or even buying biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: agents they don't necessarily need or
buying the wrong product for the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: problem out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I think that is
critical is that everybody's got the right
[SPEAKER_00]: tools in their tool bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that had me into their facility
will see I carry, you know, I have a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: nerd bag I carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite wearing a fanny pack yet,
but I do have a giant fanny pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as much as, you know, they could
be completely nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so convenient because you do need to
have your hands free while you're out
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really shocked and surprised how
many facilities I go into and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in charge of finding pests don't
even have a hand lens, just a basic 10X
[SPEAKER_00]: hand lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something everybody can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something everybody should
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you should have almost all
your staff or, you know, whomever is in
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility having them so that they can
actually look and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really critical because I'm
sure you carry a hand lens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always carry a hand lens when I go
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into a growing situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them on eBay or Amazon,
usually under 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one free at a trade show at the
Advanced Nutrients booth, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: only Advanced Nutrients thing I will ever
have or use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know Biobest often gives them away
for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at, you know, we did that all day
insect ID workshop at Cultivate a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to Biobest and they provided
hand lenses and lanyards for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that came to the workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they often have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes BASF has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a side little plug, that's like the
only thing I saw on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not promoting myself at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't find them or get one for
free, I do some other website,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily to make money off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because I was tired of growers
having excuse of, well, I can't find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now growers don't have an excuse,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one I carry, just because I'm a
little more mature in my age than you
[SPEAKER_00]: youngins, it has an LED light in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a darker growing situation
or if you're down into the plant canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that LED light in there actually really
helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in my youthful days when I was like
20, I could actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of stuff without hand lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm, you know, creeping up on 50,
yeah, those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having that extra light in there can
really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want minimum 10X magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some up to like 30X with just,
you know, the traditional handheld loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can be very hard to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best thing to do is to use
like a 10, maybe 15X out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you find a problem, I like to
snip a leaf, put it in a bag, label it
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is, and I take it to the office
or wherever, you know, there's a desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is when I bring out the
Dynalight, which again, if you don't own a
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynalight, I don't want to call you,
you know, stupid, but it is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best investments you can make because you
can take really good pictures with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can zoom in better,
get more refined pictures to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: send because people, especially on
Instagram, you got to stop sending me cell
[SPEAKER_00]: phone quick snaps on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot zoom in on pictures when you
private message somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nearly impossible for me to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want people to help you with your
ID, you need to get a good picture with
[SPEAKER_00]: something Dynalight and then email it so I
can take it and I can zoom in or other
[SPEAKER_00]: people can zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is one of the worst social media
platforms for using photos for diagnosis
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its lack of manipulating
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even on Facebook, you can
download the image and zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, when you upload images,
you do lose quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why emailing is one of the
better ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texting is maybe second, but again,
because of the data compression to make
[SPEAKER_00]: images smaller to save on data,
texting often reduces file size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I need to get in there and look
at, you know, tiny little hairs and tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little parts, you know, I need to have as
big an image as you can get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it may seem expensive
spending 150 or $300 on a Dynalight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if it saves a plant or saves a couple
plants, you know, or saves you from having
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy in a pesticide or even some bios,
it's paid for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly useful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend that everybody have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, Tad, aren't you making them available
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I followed your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out and got myself a Dynalight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in the $300 range and tried
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also contacted the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now on our website, I offer a few
options, sort of a good, better,
[SPEAKER_01]: best from what sort of they recommended
and also my conversations with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to say the Dynalight is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of the images is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at the pores of our skin
and other things around the house with it
[SPEAKER_01]: just because I didn't have any bugs handy
to take a peek at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm excited to get out into some grow
operations and actually look at some
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you can not only use it with
your computer through USB, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: like a $2, $3 connector USB converter on
Amazon or wherever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can connect it to your smartphone
or your tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the software is super easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there have been precursors to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like the IPM scope, but the IPM
scope was extremely difficult to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: having to manually go into the settings of
your computer and change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it work where I mean, I think the
Dynalight is pretty much idiot proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just plug and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's another thing that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I talked about putting
things in bags, you know, having,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, little ziplock baggies to put
samples in is really important because you
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't want to, you know, if you
suspect something has a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to carry it around through
your different rooms or near their plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to quarantine it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do think that one of the big
issues that's happening in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: just self contamination, where people,
you know, will go in in the morning and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to go see their pest problems
and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start in the dirtiest part of
the facility and then end up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest part later in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've just spread the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're carrying around open exposed
plant cuttings, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're scouting, you always want
to start with the cleanest part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and then work your way to the
dirtiest through the day and put samples
[SPEAKER_00]: in bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good to carry irrigation
flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, if you find a problem,
you can stick a flag in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if you do do a treatment,
you can come back and check that exact
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to make sure it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will allow other people at the
facility to know, you know, if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, you know, this this colored flag
means there's a mite issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we know, you know, there's a
disease issue because you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: striped flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help people know,
because if you say, oh, go back into house
[SPEAKER_00]: two, bench three and go find the hemp
russet mites, that's going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else a bunch of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the tags are flagged, you know,
that I'm sorry, the plants are flagged,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are tagged with flags,
then they're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another critical tool to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use a flagging tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can come up with some other system,
but irrigation flags come in lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inexpensive to use and readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another good thing I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, of course, having your
phone with you to take overall shots is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the quality of the images for
identifying insect issues, it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of people guessing on what
problems are due to these overview shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't like to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see actual images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to count legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at antenna to make sure
that we're getting the right diagnosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody wants to waste money or use
an ineffective treatment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, those kinds of
things are pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's not as important,
but I again, it's worth every penny is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an infrared thermometer gun to
know what your temperatures really are in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant canopies, not just your air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, when you're making decisions
on biocontrol agents, you really know what
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of temperatures you're running
inside the plants and not just in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can find some pretty
significant differences depending on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, leaf size, color of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variables that are in
there when you start looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it can make a difference on
what biocontrol you're going to select.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I mean, it's,
I don't know, it's kind of exciting for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to show growers this and they get so
excited when you show them for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something again, we've done an
ornamentals on vegetables for years is
[SPEAKER_00]: just to take a white board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could even use a sheet of
paper, but I think white boards work the
[SPEAKER_00]: best and just put it next to your plant
and then bang your leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like thrips and mites not
necessarily hemp russet mitre broad mite
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're too small to see with a
naked eye, but things like two spotted
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, thrips, aphids, they'll just
fall out because when I go into facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: and people are, you know, scouting,
they're taking a leaf and flipping it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking a leaf and flipping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that takes too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your chances of finding stuff pretty
slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take this white board, you hold it up
next to the plant, bang the leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff falls right out because I was in
one facility recently and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping leaves, looking for thrips and
couldn't find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we banged them on a board,
thrips just came raining out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy way that, I mean,
and again, pretty standard practice in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture to find where the pests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's, you know, a pretty
important tool there to have and to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry a small one in my nerd bag when
I'm out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you can also use is the
lid of the styrofoam cooler from the
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping from the biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save those lids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make really good bang boards out
there for when you're scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you say a bang board,
now you're talking about a relatively thin
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of cardboard or wood that's just
painted white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to picture people going out
with a two by four trying to like hit
insects on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can use a white painter's
palette that's that thin white plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a white notepad, but the thing
with notepads, if your plant is wet at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, then you end up getting your notepad
all wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the lids to the styrofoam coolers
you can use because it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about an inch thick, flat piece of
white styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, for smaller plants, you can
literally pick them up and bang them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see if I've got, I know I've got some
videos somewhere that maybe I can send you
[SPEAKER_00]: some that you could attach somehow to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe is that something you can do that
people could see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I should just post a little video
up on Instagram so people can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think people should be following
you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should definitely let people know
your Instagram title.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then on the podcast page, I can put up
any videos or links to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that worked out because it's
something that it's good to see how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, if you could ever get to any
of my scouting workshops or classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's good to see it firsthand
because it is it's kind of hard to just
[SPEAKER_00]: explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's really hard with pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reading stuff online oftentimes isn't
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be out doing stuff firsthand
and seeing it to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take me through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we've knocked the insects onto the
whiteboard, the bang board and we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: them there, you're then taking that and
taking it into another room to look closer
[SPEAKER_01]: at the insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you killing the insects so that they
can't move like with alcohol or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a process for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I go to take that picture to
send it to an expert, what do I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure is included in that photo?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so when I'm doing it, only because I'm
old and crusty and been doing this for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, I can pretty much tell really
fast what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just again, it just comes with experience
and it's something that as growers do this
[SPEAKER_00]: more, they'll get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's easy to see thrips because
they're, you know, more cigar shaped when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're running on the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we do do crush them just
because we don't want them going back onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes, too, if you're using
biocontrol agents, your predatory mites
[SPEAKER_00]: can fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos, the minute pirate bug, will often
find immature oreos fall out and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: those you don't want to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually you want to kind of shake
those back into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to collect specimens to get
them ID'd, what you need to do is have
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called an aspirator and you can buy
those from Bioquip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're about ten dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically like a mini bug vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you basically can you
put one end of the tube in your mouth and
[SPEAKER_00]: you suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a filter in there so you won't
suck up the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sucks the bugs or mites or whatever
into a vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you try to pick thrips up and
mites up, you're going to damage them and
[SPEAKER_00]: crush them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way they get sucked into the vials
and you can put alcohol in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can snap a lid on and then you can send it
off to get it identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these insects and mites are off
the plant material, you can ship dead
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and alcohol to anybody across
state lines to get them identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can't do is pluck a leaf and then
ship the plant material across state lines
[SPEAKER_00]: with the insects on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the way you can get your
stuff identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things you mentioned is that
things like broad mites or hemp recit
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, you won't necessarily be able to
see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those ending up on that bang board?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like should we have a spray bottle with
alcohol in it, for example, to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we can't see that may still
be on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's the protocol around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you've got broad mites or hemp
recit mites, killing 10 of them is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, you know, not going to make that
much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are suspecting that a plant
does have, you know, broad mite or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: recit mite and you use your hand because
you use your hand to bang the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even if you see spider mites before you
go to other houses or other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably wash my hand off because
your hand is going to be touching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that these very small mites,
you know, since they're spread on even the
[SPEAKER_00]: legs of insects, they're spread on bird's
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spread very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hand could be act as the vector to
spread these around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could wear a latex glove if you
wanted, or you could just wash your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just, you know, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think about, am I spreading
my problems around a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times I'm finding people are
doing it to themselves by just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're trying to treat in one
area, then they spread it to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, having, you know,
wearing lab coats and booties that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're not doing this to just
look like nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you do this to stop the spread
of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you, the hemp recit mite and
broad mites are a pretty serious issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just keep spreading them and
having, you know, just think about
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation all the time, because a lot of
these issues can be stopped through good
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, my thought was that BangBoard
might be a source of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but you have to rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you have to rub the BangBoard
back up on to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not because the BangBoard is
not necessarily always touching the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're smacking the plant and
knocking things to fall on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hands kind of acting like a
hurricane, smacking trees and then stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: falls out of it and it falls on to the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the end of the day, yeah,
you could definitely rinse it off before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you put it in your office or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've never, you know, sprayed or
cleaned it between every bang because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're walking down the line and going
bang, bang, bang, bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're doing a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just stop and spray and then
wait for the alcohol to evaporate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're never going to get anything done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you take me through like a
traditional morning scouting routine that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would want someone to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, when you get in, you know,
put on your your your work clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, I'm finding that
definitely people that have states where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's legal to grow at home, those growers
are having a lot more issues in states
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can't because people are
bringing pestins from pestin from their
[SPEAKER_00]: their own plants at their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you have to be well
aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change into your air quote, you know,
work clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even, you know, you know, you can do
washable scrubs, you can do tie back
[SPEAKER_00]: suits, you know, the people you do lab
coats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all different kinds of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just have to look at what
works best for your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, start in your cleanest
room and work your way through to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dirtiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you go into the dirtiest
room and you have to go back to the clean
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you know, it's best if you can
change your lab coat or change your
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes or change something because you
don't want to take the pest back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, you know, your propagation
area should be your cleanest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, people have a lot of
pests and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just keep it keeps moving
with the plants all the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problems are spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, ideally, you'd want to start in
the cleanest room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your hand lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, you know, your camera,
which is on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your bang board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I do suggest is that you
don't walk the same pattern each time
[SPEAKER_00]: because you do see different things from
different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the size and there's a
lot of variables, depending on how we come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with, you know, how many plants are you
going to sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also and I've had to do a lot of
firmly pushing on growers lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use sticky cards and you can't
leave them up for three months and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to be paying a dollar a sticky
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why the cannabis industry is
just not wanting to adopt this really easy
[SPEAKER_00]: method to know what pest you have that you
have out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot more thrips in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the biggest thing the last
month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if growers had sticky cards up,
they would know that they had thrips in
[SPEAKER_00]: there probably before they started seeing
damage and could mount an attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, leaving them up for months and
months and months, that doesn't do any
[SPEAKER_00]: good if we're talking about monitoring
sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be changed every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you come into work on Monday
morning, whoever's doing your scouting or
[SPEAKER_00]: management, the first thing is to go to
the sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should always be dated and then they
can go by, look at the sticky cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what they're finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start to see a few thrips,
you know, all right, we need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mount an attack then on thrips
before they get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's very interesting is thrips
damage on ornamentals and vegetables is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very different than the damage we
see on thrips on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at some of the damage images
online, you have to be very careful about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think sometimes people are
mistaking, um, spider mite damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, thrips damage for spider mite damage,
cause they can look kind of similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's where banging them and seeing
what falls in on the leaves, looking
[SPEAKER_00]: what's on your sticky cards will give you
a clue to what's really going on out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but you need to change your sticky
cards every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll tell you right now, and this is
not, you know, I get no money and no
[SPEAKER_00]: kickbacks, but companies like beneficial
and sectory, they have really good dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards, which are the kind of sticky
cards that growers need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the really wet,
gloppy ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because those are for more for
trapping larger beetles and things you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to trap, you know, fungus gnats
and shore flies and thrips and other small
[SPEAKER_00]: flying insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, again, bio bed, I'm sorry,
beneficial and sectory has great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bio vest has some great cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, and they come in an array of
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also offer sticky roles and they can
really help guide you on what size of
[SPEAKER_00]: cards you need for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, nothing against Amazon
because let me tell you, I'm on Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: every two to three days buying stuff,
but the cards people are buying on Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: are not the right cards and they're paying
too much money for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little ranty post on my Instagram
because when I'm at grow facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see the price people are paying
for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I have a heart attack seeing
what the cannabis guys are paying in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to what the ornamental guys are
paying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, when you buy a pack of sticky
cards from beneficial and sectory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's 50 cards in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use them if you're
changing them every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also cards don't expire, you know,
that pack can, you know, last you a year
[SPEAKER_00]: or two and they don't go bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a disposable item necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much better to have them and use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be part of that routine on
Monday morning when you get in and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to record what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep records and it seems
like it's a pain in the butt, but let me
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you, after you do it over and over,
you start to see patterns and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: forecast things that potentially could
happen with your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to see, well, this time every
year we get an influx of this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a month beforehand, let's start getting
ready for this pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why we focus so hard in
this, in agriculture, because at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day, it helps save money and we can
head off a lot of pest issues before they
[SPEAKER_00]: get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go in, you're going to check
your cards, you're going to write down
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see, you're going to have your
bang boards, you're going to walk around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to knock on numerous places,
and you're going to write down what you
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's best to, you know, if you can put
it like into an Excel spreadsheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's something that you can share
with other people in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can have good communication
because somebody may not know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having an outbreak of thrips in,
you know, house or room B and go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and then accidentally go into your
propagation area afterwards and spread the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to have really
good communication skills and have that
[SPEAKER_00]: information of what pests are where to let
everybody know in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, you don't want to hide pests
issues with your coworkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to let everybody know so the
problem can be stopped through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, over all these years of doing
it, the facilities I've worked with that
[SPEAKER_00]: have really good pest management
communication and record keeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just have the best pest management
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk about sticky cards,
you're using them for monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know some people are using them to
trap like adult fungus gnats and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, or the sticky tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there sort of different purposes for
different cards or do you not even like to
[SPEAKER_01]: use sticky tape at all in facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an excellent question to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those sticky cards that I've just been
talking about are for monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you change them every week
because if a card's like two weeks old and
[SPEAKER_00]: we find fungus gnats, you may not even
have fungus gnats anymore because the
[SPEAKER_00]: adults only live a week and those might've
been adults from, you know, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sticky ribbons and the very large
cards, those are used for what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are not the, you know,
the little four by six cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do mass trapping with the small
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass trapping is done with large ribbons
and larger cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those we leave up for months and
months because we're not using those to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor what pests are there or how many
are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, you know, it's like a vacuum
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be drawn to it and just
stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a way to just attract and kill
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very distinct difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the small cards are monitoring
cards and the mass trapping things are
[SPEAKER_00]: more the ribbons or the much larger cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: For using the sticky ribbon, it all
depends on how your facility's set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have great ways to put them
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get them too near the
crop because if you get your plant stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: in them, you'll never get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's somewhere near head height,
being from personal experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to, you know, lean your
head into it because those sticky ribbons
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to assess your facility and
see even if you have the right setup to
[SPEAKER_00]: use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's why working with somebody
that knows about that stuff can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a good location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessarily a good location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you get your head stuck in
sticky ribbons a few times, you do learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have my chair, but I've
definitely gotten those cards stuck on my,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck on my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a while to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one of the things you mentioned was
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we're putting up monitoring
cards, can you talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: where we want those cards to be located in
the facility or in the canopy even?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can depend on what pest you're
really targeting and depends again on how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually seeing the potential
facilities set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally I always like to have
monitoring cards near the doors because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's usually the entry point of pests,
especially since I am seeing so many
[SPEAKER_00]: growing facilities without vestibules or
proper, you know, ways to stop pests from
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside from getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the doors is always very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're more concerned about fungus
gnats, you definitely want to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: lower to the soil line because fungus
gnats tend to be down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If thrips are an issue, they're better to
be just up above the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good location for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is why, you know,
it's, it's very general information I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why having somebody that's
worked with the stuff to help set up where
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to put what, you know,
can really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's several people out
there that, that can do it, but I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, I have issue with,
you know, some people out there promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: the themselves as pest management people,
which just don't have the experience to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure the person you're
dealing with is knowledgeable on the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and has had experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people like Kelly Vance and Paul
Cool, both have been commercial growers
[SPEAKER_00]: for years before they went to go work for
biocontrol companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know, I mean, they put sticky
cards out themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've counted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to place them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there are people that do have
really good experience with this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doorways, areas that are more problem
prone, and definitely propagation for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, because that's often where you see
fungus gnats starting, because they tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little moister in the soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all the way up to finished
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with, with cannabis, since it's so
tall, we are putting some down low on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil line and some above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, depending on how you're set up,
you know, is this something you can attach
[SPEAKER_00]: to a stake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to put them on a pole?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you hanging them?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different variables,
depending on how you're actually growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how we position and how we
actually put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we covered that pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to ask you a little bit
more about what you've been seeing as
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been going out to the facilities,
like what types of insects in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been dealing with over the past
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, as I mentioned, as of late,
we're seeing a lot of thrips and different
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips species out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have been really great
and collecting thrips for me because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still trying to figure out, you know,
all the thrips species we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to identify thrips from
their immature life stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really we need the adults, which can be
also difficult in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thrips are definitely something I
think that people are so fixated on broad
[SPEAKER_00]: mite right now and root aphids that the
thrips numbers are definitely coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to definitely keep an
eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing about thrips is the
adults do fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have sticky cards out and you
don't need to buy the expensive blue ones
[SPEAKER_00]: for thrips, yellow works just fine on the
sticky cards for trapping thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very tiny though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make sure you know what
thrips on sticky cards look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can detect them very easily on the
sticky cards before they start becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've been discussing,
so you have a little feeding damage here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little feeding damage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is that really going to impact
your harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to come in, you know,
with the big guns and nuclear facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want the thrips numbers to
get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because thrips are, you know, pretty
prevalent in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants can, you know, again,
live with some feeding damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just don't want them to get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also thrips are known in especially
the vegetable industry for vectoring
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We honestly don't know yet in cannabis,
you know, all the viruses that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for cannabis and if thrips are
vectoring them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's best just to try to keep them in
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a wise thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, you got to detect them
early and take them out early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably the next thing,
I've been getting a lot of emails on our
[SPEAKER_00]: root aphids, which you guys are spreading
the root aphid amongst yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when people are getting
cuttings in and we, you know, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed this thoroughly on your other
podcast, we were talking about dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: because with the root aphids, since they
do live on the roots, people think if they
[SPEAKER_00]: get in cuttings, they're not going to get
root aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm seeing happening is when
those root aphids get to a high
[SPEAKER_00]: population, they start climbing up the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the alate or the winged form is
on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a cutting and it goes to
somebody else and that one adult aphid is
[SPEAKER_00]: on there, the female, then she can start a
whole new colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, these are not coming in
by numbers from the outside, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the particular aphid we're seeing at this
point, it can be a pest in other crops
[SPEAKER_00]: like rice and some ornamental plants,
but I'm not seeing high numbers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental crops of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it, but it's not a huge
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just getting spread around through
the industry on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, again, sanitation and
proper protocol on dealing with incoming
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is really critical because the root
aphid, the hemp rye, the hemp russet mite,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you're bringing it in on plant
material completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp russet mites are still a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely still seeing them around,
but I think everybody is getting settled
[SPEAKER_00]: into programs, at least the people I'm
working with, where we can get them down
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, such a low level that,
yeah, there's a few here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not suffering yield loss at the
end because you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate them unless you, you know,
completely shut down, scrub everything
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and then find clean plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a challenge because I've seen
plants that are, you know, young plants
[SPEAKER_00]: being sold and they have hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very challenging to keep it
from coming in and growers have to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that eradication is not going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even a term we use anymore in
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keeping it below the economic
threshold, keeping the pest numbers so low
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't suffer any economic loss
from it.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned thrips, you mentioned
root aphids, hemp russet mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What insects are we bringing in,
I guess, from the outside, what do we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about from the outside
environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like spider mites, for example,
whereas certain things are like broad,
[SPEAKER_01]: not broad mites, but hemp russet mites you
mentioned are only spread on plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what things are environmental in terms
of just our outside atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be bringing it in from our,
you know, from our outside garden or just
[SPEAKER_01]: from walking around versus things that are
being spread specifically on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is just, you know, every day kind
of pest, definitely two spot spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I have it in my yard
right now, which I'm pretty excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: because I need some because I've been on
this videography filming binge lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will say for those of you that
are coming, I'm teaching a workshop next
[SPEAKER_00]: month in Charlotte, North Carolina,
for biocontrol for plant propagators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually going to go to out to
Metrolinus Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred and eighty acre greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to show you how we do
biocontrol releases there, show about
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a really good hands on
workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are going to be lectures on
the Tuesday and Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to be wowed and dazzled
and thrilled at all this new video
[SPEAKER_00]: footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shot of of I've got footage of,
you know, like Swirsky feeding on Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower Thrips, Cucumeris feeding on
Western Flower Thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got footage and I'd never even
seen it in my life before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran in and woke William up at like three
in the morning to tell him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the that's nice deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got footage of a Western Flower
Thrips actually hatching out of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people never see it in their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to be able to show those
videos at this workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to my point, I need spider mites to
be able to, you know, show the predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: mites feeding on spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just went out to my yard and on my
milkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two spot spider mites just right in
my yard right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that is really what
we call a cosmopolitan pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went down to any retail garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's very easily can
easily get into your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think the commercial cannabis
growers, they're on top of the spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because that is something they
can recognize early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damage is pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different predatory
mite options depending on how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers I'm working with,
a lot of them are just doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative program, because if you look
at a preventative spider mite program and
[SPEAKER_00]: using something, and again, this depends
on where you are in the country and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow, but like persimilis,
you're talking about every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's less than a penny a square foot for a
preventative program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the prevention costs are so low
that it's definitely worth doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, broad mite, I do believe broad mite
is being spread through cannabis cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but broad mite is also a pest in
ornamentals and it's a pest in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's somewhat cosmopolitan,
but the broad mite, I don't find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape so much, but definitely at
commercial growing facilities for again,
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental hanging baskets, people that
produce a pepper, young pepper plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can find the broad mites there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are definitely finding them in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be coming on cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you go to somebody's garden center
in the morning, or out in a pepper field
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go to work, there's a chance you
could spread them that way and vice versa,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you could pick broad mite up at work
off a cannabis and bring it home to your
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with broad mite, it's so tiny,
it's tiny like the hemp russet mite is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually see the damage before you
really realize you have them and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have very high numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, a lot of commercial growers are
using Cucumeris, the predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cucumeris will feed on flower thrips,
their first instar, but also feeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: broad mite and it also snacks,
not controlled, but will snack on two-spot
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a Cucumeris program, like a base
of that, is a really good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inexpensive to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insectaries producing them
right in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other good suppliers like
BioBest, BioLine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other options to get them from
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the things that you mentioned
was pepper plants having broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that got me thinking about how a lot
of growers that are doing living mulches
[SPEAKER_01]: that I hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worry about that as a potential
vector for some of these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that really a concern with a lot of
these cover crops or other crops that they
[SPEAKER_01]: may have in the facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any facilities like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't seen many cannabis growers
that are doing that because usually the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers that I'm working in are a
bit larger facilities and they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more containerized plant material and not
so much the living soil as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the scale of the facilities I'm
often dealing with don't lend itself to
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, we've had lots of years of
experience with using these nectare plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in ag and ornamentals and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you better know what plants you're
putting in there because I've seen people
[SPEAKER_00]: make mistakes and turns out that the
plants they're using are harboring a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pests are reproducing on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why you better be very
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marigolds are one that I just cringe at
people using because those are very prone
[SPEAKER_00]: to having spider mite issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very prone to having thrips
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a very buggy plant because when we
grow them for the homeowner market,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to get treated a lot because
they do have a lot of insect and mite
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're very selective on the
plants we're using like with our banker
[SPEAKER_00]: plant programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are sticking with specific
ornamental peppers, but we also treat
[SPEAKER_00]: those peppers with our beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you're applying your aureus
and cucumeris, not only does your crop get
[SPEAKER_00]: it, those plants would get an application
too in the growing situation you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about or they should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because peppers I think are something and
again, this will be a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to do talking about using
peppers banker plants for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production because I think there's a lot
of potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually there is a greenhouse
facility in New York State, Dickman Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting ready to go into some
serious production of ornamental pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grown with biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when cannabis people want to move
into doing this that they can contact
[SPEAKER_00]: Dickman, get these plants, they won't have
pesticide residue on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't advertise that they've been
raised with beneficials because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: ship insects across state lines without
having permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But know that these plants have been grown
using the beneficials on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: wink, wink, nod, nod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that so you'll be able to move them
into your facility and then it will
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a good resource for aureus,
the minute pirate bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually ordered some seeds and
grew out the purple flash pepper in our
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't bring in any beneficial insects
just because we didn't have much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: budget for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was curious if any would
naturalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to actually go back and see if
we dig anything on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all things aside, they're just they're
beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, that aspect of our
business is it's really just a you pick
[SPEAKER_01]: for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a high value crop for me or
part of my revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was, I would definitely put more
time and energy into maintaining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's a big difference between
growing outside and growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're outside, you don't
necessarily necessarily need to inoculate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come again to this this workshop
I'm doing next month there at Metrolina,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the mump fields is 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's another one that's
like 16 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do put out a lot of these insectary
plants, but we have pre inoculated some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them with beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other plants do attract in
native beneficials because this is being
[SPEAKER_00]: done outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the plants that we use strictly
inside, we do have to inoculate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials because you can't get the
numbers of beneficials coming in from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was a really good
learning moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Colorado where I was working just
recently, actually got back yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to lunch with the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we were walking back to the car,
they had some planners in the city and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were filled with a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also had petunias and some
other plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had them stop and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you looked at the a list,
the list was just just tons of insects
[SPEAKER_00]: were on it buzzing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were beneficials, there are
pollinators, there are all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing on the petunias and the
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows you that if you plant
the right plants, and this is for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, you can attract beneficials in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you don't want to plant things
that are going to be a big magnet for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be careful on your plant
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look at, you know,
what your environment is, what your key
[SPEAKER_00]: pests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we put all these programs
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find one solution that
works for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, pest management really
today has to be pretty customized for
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you're growing,
what you're growing, who you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, all these different
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what's your budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of my growers, they don't
have time to do banker plant systems or
[SPEAKER_00]: nectare plants or mess with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll just rather buy beneficials
every two weeks and dump them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people have the time and are on a
tighter budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd rather try to, you know,
encourage some of their native,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really have to know what you're
doing, because you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not breeding pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing you mentioned there earlier
on was about applications and propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I've heard you mentioned to me
before that one of your issues with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the other recommendations you're seeing
from people that are going around as bug
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants is that they're doing too
heavy of applications too late in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important to get started
right away with that cutting to really
[SPEAKER_01]: establish those beneficial insects and
keep the pathogen or pest populations down
[SPEAKER_01]: early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that pretty accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stick a gold star on your shirt
right now for like I listen when you talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like I mean, I mean,
I don't know everything and I'm still
[SPEAKER_00]: learning every day to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to start clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll deal with it later mentality,
because all that's going to happen is your
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost of doing a bio program and
propagation when the plants are tiny and
[SPEAKER_00]: close together, it's so inexpensive
comparatively to try to come in and flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean up an epidemic problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we're really going to
focus on at this workshop, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way, it's called the Plug and
Cutting Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very quaint meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super big, but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just for pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the whole meeting talks about a lot
of propagation stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a mini trade show with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my focus there is to, yes,
beat you propagators up or people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: propagating young plants on more so how to
use bios and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Metrolinus, you know,
if you've got a greenhouse facility that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one hundred and eighty acres and they're
using bio control in their propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can do it on that scale,
anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually going to have the
employees that actually when they come to
[SPEAKER_00]: work, they actually put out the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to have them there
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see how they actually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're also going to talk about,
you know, other different situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's going to be a tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go out and see the mum
fields where we're doing the banker
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a good
educational opportunity for for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only run this meeting every few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and as a side note, some really good
plant pathologists will be there like Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hayes, who he is a good close
personal friend, but he is an awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to talk disease for
biological disease management,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put up a link on the podcast page
to the conference so people can sign up
[SPEAKER_01]: and check it out if they're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, well, since I mean, I generally
don't like to do self plugs, but it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like this show, I'm doing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also doing another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look at the date,
but it's the bio control East conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be up in Rochester,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Friday of the show,
I'm doing a four hour insect ID class,
[SPEAKER_00]: which if you missed it, it cultivate,
which, by the way, had a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited to see them that are
really getting into the insect ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically going to be doing the very
similar thing at the bio control East
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting up in New York, where you're going
to get four hours of pretty intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: insect and mite ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which applies to ornamentals, vegetables
and cannabis, because as we've discussed,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of crossover pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have some of the cannabis
specific pests included.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also putting together like a
booklet to take home with you from that
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting, from that class that will
basically be a pretty good insect ID
[SPEAKER_00]: booklet for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the bio controls West one,
as you as you may recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really enjoyed getting to hear some
of the speakers and also the course you
[SPEAKER_01]: taught relating to insects and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely a great opportunity if
you're close by and can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and by the way, back to backtrack a
little bit, you're talking about pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about your foliar aphids,
because those species and we are seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: several different foliar aphid species out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you don't
necessarily always pick up on sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: cards, because, again, sticky cards are
more for flying insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got flying foliar aphids,
and you've got a really high population
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in your facility, or you're open
to the outside and flying aphids from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors have come into your facility,
we see that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those winged aphids may not even be a
species that can survive on your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got them trapped on the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way you can look to see if
this is an issue or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are definitely seeing foliar aphid
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a pretty high number of
them before they really cause an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't want them to get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, there's, you know, we have
several different commercial parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, predators like lace
wings, which you've seen doing a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are inexpensive to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even just hosing them down
with water, you can knock a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: off your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just yeah, we are seeing foliar aphids
and several different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just want to remind listeners that
it's so important to start with
[SPEAKER_01]: identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you've taught me
because I still talk to growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking to me about all these
different pesticide applications that they
[SPEAKER_01]: start immediately the moment they notice
an insect pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I try and get them to
backtrack and make sure that they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have a positive identification because the
treatment for broad mites versus aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: versus thrips can vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're going to throw money at a
problem or potentially stress the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: through a pesticide application,
we want to make sure that we're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: right one to deal with the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something I just want to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got a second gold star,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the time of year here in
Washington where we start seeing aphids on
[SPEAKER_01]: our vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just went out and pulled some kale
that I fed to my chickens because it had
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my way of combating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the time of year where we
start seeing aphids on our vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the time of year when we start
seeing powdery mildew, when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing aphids and certain sort of insects,
like you mentioned, that tend to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonal with certain crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm not growing cannabis,
I notice it on my vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that the same thing is
happening in cannabis towards the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's starting to senesce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finishing up its flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to see higher levels of
some of these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and this is where, you know,
like with your kale, most likely you had
[SPEAKER_00]: on there what's sometimes referred to as
the crucifer aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be a little gray and are
fuzzier, almost like they've got a dusting
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that I in my life and I highly doubt
it would ever move into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did have your kale next to your
cannabis greenhouse, I wouldn't worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were growing, you know,
let's say mums and you saw a green peach
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid on that, I would be concerned
because we know that can move into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to know what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God, please stop, you know,
depending on the Internet gods to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: your problems, because I just see such bad
ID because there's so many armchair
[SPEAKER_00]: quarterbacks in the cannabis industry that
sit behind the computers and say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm done getting into fights with
these people on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just done, you know, going to these
groups because I just get attacked
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm done with trying to help that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, many of you know, you've
reached out to me through like Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: or texted me or, you know, numerous other
outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to help everybody I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dan only has so many hours in the day
and I'm working seven days a week right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient with me if I don't get back
to you immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you covering more of
the issues around scouting and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: insects that you're seeing now that you've
been working in cannabis for another year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you wanted to chat
about before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just there are some scouting apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually one that's getting
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's from Cornell and it's the
the Greenhouse Scout app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they've had some issues now because
of all the new cookies and security
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and again, it's not focused for
cannabis, but it's a good general overall
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the the basic pests,
the beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually pesticide compatibility
information in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of these ever evolving apps
that Cornell keeps adding to and being
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's from the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're very focused on being
scientifically accurate and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can go in and, you know,
if you look up, you know, a pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it can give you some of the key
beneficial that are being used for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have some where you can do
tracking of populations in it and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually print reports from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for 10 bucks, you think is
a lot of good information from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's ever improving out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that project, again, is it's a Cornell
University project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dr. Elizabeth Lamb is who's been
working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when I talk to her,
like, two or three weeks ago, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were still trying to get worked out
with Google about getting it back for sale
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the security stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that there was a problem with
their app.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've noticed every website and every
everything, you've got to agree to these
[SPEAKER_00]: new messages about cookies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just are working on getting that
worked out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that can be another
important tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I come visit your greenhouse and
you don't have sticky cards, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: poke you in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just you've got to have those sticky
cards up because they can be such a great
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll definitely put a link to that
app as well for people so they can at
[SPEAKER_01]: least monitor it and see when it becomes
available again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to thank you for your time
again today and sharing with our audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always learn something new every time I
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you giving me the
opportunity to get this information out,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, again, I'm I'm working in
multiple industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the workload's been pretty
intense and I'm trying to help everybody I
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes if I can educate the
masses a little bit more, then it might
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down on some of the other,
you know, after hours communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't mind helping people,
but it's just, you know, it gets a little
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming at times because I do want to
be able to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get you those links of my
upcoming talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep a list on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website's bug-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the home page and please
don't criticize me for my website,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a web developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy I have what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go there, there's a little
button and it's like, where's the bug
[SPEAKER_00]: lady?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it might be upcoming talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list of any of the upcoming
sessions that I'm going to be speaking at
[SPEAKER_00]: and usually have links to the actual
conferences and meetings for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I'll also get you those links
to Tad because I do think that both those
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities, the plug and cuttings and
then the BioControl East, there's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be some real good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, too, for your BC listeners,
I'm actually coming up to speak in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia this fall also at a greenhouse
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be up there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put all that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good afternoon.

Evans, also known as the Bug Lady.
