[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before diving into the podcast,
I wanted to fill you in on some changes
[SPEAKER_01]: happening with our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier in the year, we received an
anonymous complaint regarding some
[SPEAKER_01]: structural structures on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: After meeting with the county regarding
these structures, some other zoning issues
[SPEAKER_01]: came to light that require us to remove a
large amount of our storage and covered
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to this change, we are closing down
our seven-acre farm as a retail location.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feed store, edible nursery,
Yupik, and garden center are going away
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are rehoming all of our animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue to have the outdoor
preschool on the property and Kiss
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics will carry on as an online
supplier of soil amendments, soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: While it may seem like a setback,
I'm excited for the opportunity to refocus
[SPEAKER_01]: the business and have more time to spend
on the podcast, soil science, and working
[SPEAKER_01]: with Kaizen on the consulting side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maintaining seven acres and having so many
branches to the business is a lot of fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also stressful and challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my first child arriving in November,
I know I will have my hands full anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week's podcast is a bit different
from my usual podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat down with John Zee, a dedicated
cannabis grower and all around cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiast who interviewed me on a variety
of topics ranging from soil, compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, growing philosophy, and much
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of this podcast was to answer
some listener questions and just offer a
[SPEAKER_01]: different perspective on some topics we've
already covered in past episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met John through our Patreon hangouts
and it's been a lot of fun hearing about
[SPEAKER_01]: his growing experiences as well through
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our interview together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey John, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know this was going to be a
question and answer where you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask me some questions, but let's give
listeners a little background about you
[SPEAKER_01]: before we get too far into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew my first plants indoors in 1999
with very little success, but enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_00]: process enough to continue to learn about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I had done various
guerrilla grows outdoors on and off with
[SPEAKER_00]: also varying success until 2008 when the
Michigan voters passed the Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Marijuana Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I became a caregiver and
started growing indoors again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started using a peat-based medium
with salt fertilizers and had pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: success, but knew that I could probably do
a little bit better so I continued my
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came across a YouTube video of a guy
growing in deep water culture and was very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed with his results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave it a try myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the first run, I was very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields had improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appearance of the buds was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds got bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality seemed about the same as it was in
the peat with salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stuck with it and had very good
results for many years until one year I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a horrible case of root rot and tried
everything to stop this different
[SPEAKER_00]: products, methods, and nothing seemed to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in a panic, but luckily right
around that time, a friend had told me
[SPEAKER_00]: about your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after binging just about every episode,
I felt confident enough to start my own
[SPEAKER_00]: organic living soil grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked up a super soil recipe online
and the first time I used it, I was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of the product had gone way
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were just about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easy, way easier to do,
and it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't see a reason not to continue
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been reusing my soil now for two
years and have been great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still tweaking a couple of things here or
there, but I'm pretty happy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: results so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to say that you can't grow great
cannabis using other methods, but
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's this easy to do,
affordable, and natural is the way for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I'm at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, I really like it because I've
been getting emails from people that said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is something I've been
wanting to try out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the podcast sort of just gave me
that little boost of confidence to really
[SPEAKER_01]: dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Chad for doing what you do to
encourage people to grow this method
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've, and I know you've collected
a bunch of questions here from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from listeners on both the, the Patreon
site and then also through Instagram that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sent you and you've kind of compiled
a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to kind of answering some
of those and maybe filling in some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gaps that, that were left with the
different interviews with, with podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let you take it away from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question one, what would be a good
starting point for growers who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start going fully organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there products, methods or brews that
the average grower can purchase or make
[SPEAKER_00]: without an advanced understanding of soil
science or microbiology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without getting too technical,
I want to say, first off, you kind of have
[SPEAKER_01]: to identify how you, how you define the
word organic, because there are certain
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are allowed in organic
production that may or may not fit with
[SPEAKER_01]: your own moral code or ethics around that
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain things like fish hydrolysate,
for example, is stabilized with phosphoric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, which is manmade or seaweed extract
powder is stabilized with potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroxide, and those are allowed for use
in organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I was just visiting a facility who
was using potassium hydroxide as a pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pH up or sorry, pH, pH up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get those confused sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, so in theory we
could use seaweed extract powder to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH because that's approved,
but I couldn't use potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all a little bit silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say though is kind of do your
research on products if you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: use products, but if you want to be
organic, the best thing you can do is just
[SPEAKER_01]: get started and plant some plants in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overcomplicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million recipes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pick one and get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've killed so many plants over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really how you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to try new things and just
give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say put plants in soil though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go with containers if you can help
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a situation where you can
plant a plant in the ground outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where I would probably recommend
people starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually on that note, is there a reason
to use raised beds outdoors as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: digging a hole in the ground, filling it
with organic living soil and planting
[SPEAKER_00]: straight into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a question I've heard quite a
bit and I'm a big proponent of planting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground when we're talking about
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether that's directly in the ground
or in a raised bed, just giving the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as much root space as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the one thing you want to consider
with all plants and in all growing
[SPEAKER_01]: situations is you have to figure out what
the limiting factor of growth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sunlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different things that can
cause or stress a plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so determining what that is and then
fixing that and kind of working your way
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards, sort of like a priority list,
is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about planting in ground
versus in beds, the things I look at there
[SPEAKER_01]: are what's your floodplain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your water table at if it's very
low?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's very high, then you may need to do
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of burrowing creatures are you
dealing with in your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to have gophers or
something, moles, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: digging up around those roots and causing
disturbance, then you may want to put
[SPEAKER_01]: something down underneath and then put in
a raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the quality of your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: If your soil is just pure clay or pure
sand, it's going to be really tough to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's no real reason not to
go in soil versus beds in this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, my big ones are water table,
burrowing creatures, and then the other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones would be excessive heavy metals or
some sort of toxicity that may have been
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by the previous owners of your land
or some sort of land management issue
[SPEAKER_01]: where, I don't know, was there a gasoline
stored right above where you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow your plants now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're going to want to get that
tested and make sure that that land is
[SPEAKER_01]: clean because cannabis especially is very
good at accumulating nutrients and heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals into its leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of research out there that
supports that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be really careful what we're
planting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all that being said, nine times out of
10, just put it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when growing in containers,
is there a way to recycle soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amend between cycles while keeping soil
disturbance to a minimum, such as with no
[SPEAKER_00]: chop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this gets a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about living soils
and reusing soils, there's a couple things
[SPEAKER_01]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much nutrients and how much biology
can we really get going in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: container?
[SPEAKER_01]: With our soils, I recommend at least a
seven to 10 gallon container for a full
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with auto flowers that are smaller
genetics, you could probably get away with
[SPEAKER_01]: a five gallon, possibly even smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Tim Wilson, who I've had on the
podcast, he was one of my first guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was back in the 70s growing in very,
very small containers of almost pure
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings in his setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he claims to have had really good
success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I like to have a little bit larger
container because we're putting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about reusing that now,
let's just use a seven gallon container as
[SPEAKER_01]: an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we go to reuse that soil,
the process is a bit more complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's not going to be a lot of
soil left by the time we remove the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what soil is left is going to be much
more depleted to where you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go water only, which is
really challenging to do with a small
[SPEAKER_01]: container, you're not going to be able to
get all those nutrients back into the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do add that many nutrients,
what's going to happen is that soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to thermally compost again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've essentially just added all this
food that's going to feed the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the soil, mostly the bacteria
and archaea, and it's going to create this
[SPEAKER_01]: exothermic reaction where it's going to
heat up the container itself and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: roots aren't going to like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually have to wait for that
whole process to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what some people have done is they'll
run two soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have one soil in their
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other soil will be sitting and they'll
re-amend that and then they'll flip it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's still a lot of labor,
which is why I really like beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the advantage of a bed over a container
is you can have multiple plants in a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go on our website, you can see
we just did a study with Gold Leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens, Ben Higgins did this,
and you can hear about it in my interview
[SPEAKER_01]: with him a couple podcasts ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he talks about is how planting
where you have communal beds, so more than
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant per bed, we actually get better
yield and better results than plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are isolated and planted by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also each plant has access to
more soil per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though in containers, for example,
in this trial that we did, each plant had
[SPEAKER_01]: more soil all to itself than in the total
amount per bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it actually worked out to where the
plant's able to push its roots out further
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not limited by a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So root space is not a limiting factor of
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants are able to communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really interesting
research around there on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that soil in that bed is actually
going to be less depleted when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can amend it at a lighter rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what people like Gold Leaf are
doing, and Justin, who I had on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, would legit, they're just
reamending right back into the bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: lightly tilling it in, and then replanting
24 to 36 hours later because they just,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a commercial facility, they can't
afford to have downtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing with your beds,
John?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you reamending them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I'm growing in 15 gallon
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the cycle's done, I'll just pull
the main stem out and throw the soil ball
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a pile, chop it up, add my
reamendments, water it down, and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: it sit until I need to reuse it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now I'm on a perpetual harvest,
so once a week I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil actually ends up sitting for
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, you mentioned the
thermophilic thing, because just the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day, I was checking on the soil,
and I just happened to touch some of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I noticed it got hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I zapped it with my IR thermometer,
and it was only 85 degrees, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient temperature was only 72,
so it was clearly getting warmer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: air around it, which I thought was
interesting, which I had never really
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I'm chilling it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mixing it all up together really good
so all the amendments get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a disadvantage to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the study you just cited right
there shows that ideally, if you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: beds, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those that, for whatever reason,
can have a bed that have to use pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there a real disadvantage to breaking
up the soil like that and reamending?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I've heard of people doing it
so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that are top dressing,
those nutrients, so rather than putting
[SPEAKER_01]: all the nutrients in right at the
beginning of the cycle, you could top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress with them, which I actually think,
based on what I'm seeing, is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: better, but it is more labor, and I think
it's a little trickier to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we want to talk about optimal plant
health, I think regular feeding of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, whether we're talking synthetic
or organic, I think is better for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it creates more work and also a lot
more challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are still
massively over-applying phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing it with nitrogen even.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one, especially with living
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see it so much or hear about it
on the hydro side, but you do see it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, quite a bit with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want to touch on is this idea
that you talked about about the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: getting hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important people think
about that, because when we're top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing nutrients, organic nutrients,
or when we're re-amending our soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing is we're feeding all the
microorganisms, primarily, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria and archaea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do that, they're going to be
more efficient at accessing those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, especially nitrogen,
than your plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be careful with how we're
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to put too many nutrients
in, let's say we have a pot with a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, and we add a bunch of fish meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bacteria is going to be more
efficient at accessing the nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fish meal than the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to start reproducing,
because it has all this new food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to not only just heat up
the soil, potentially, but it's also going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be better at accessing the available
nutrients in that soil to where you may
[SPEAKER_01]: see a plant deficiency, along with all the
other stress that you're causing from the
[SPEAKER_01]: heat of the bacteria reproducing so
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're amending soils,
it's important not to add too much so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have an issue like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to be aware of when you
are re-amending and that soil is sitting,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you let it cool back down to ambient
air temperature to know that it's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized and has good nutrient cycling
going on before you put a plant into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a hurry, getting the soil out
of a big pile and into pots will slow this
[SPEAKER_01]: process down dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, sometimes we've shipped
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even after letting it sit two to three
weeks, just the process of bagging it from
[SPEAKER_01]: a pile into the totes and then sending it
across the country or on a semi truck,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that jostling and the reintroduction
of oxygen can cause that soil to heat up
[SPEAKER_01]: again a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it does, what we want to do,
I tell people, is let it cook a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer as we like to say in the campus
industry, or get it into those pots,
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain the moisture content,
and then let it sit and then give it a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll probably be fine to plant
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before you do, you've got to reach
down into there, make sure it's cooled
[SPEAKER_01]: off, and not going to overheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of some questions I get
quite a bit that is kind of good to
[SPEAKER_01]: clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to just say water,
sea ports of cool water, 60 degree water
[SPEAKER_00]: into that pot that had been filled with
the soil that is currently cooking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and obviously it's going to lower the
temperature temporarily, will it just go
[SPEAKER_00]: back up as soon as the bacteria gets to
work again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're not really solving the
problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you are going to lower the
temperature temporarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what has to happen is that
bacteria has to have the time to work
[SPEAKER_01]: through those nutrients and slow down that
biological process of consuming them and
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really it's a little bit more of a
waiting game or removing the thermal mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a composting perspective,
you kind of need a three by three by three
[SPEAKER_01]: foot pile to really allow it to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to heat up if you just have
a small amount, even if you add more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to that, just in general as a
composting rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get the soil out into pots,
typically that introduction of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the movement of it slows that process
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it seems to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a compost thermometer,
which is a great tool for, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of growers to have, what you can do
with that is you can check the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and make sure it's not any
warmer than your ambient air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are cooking soil,
you want to stay in that range of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: 130, 31 degrees Fahrenheit to 160 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we thermally compost
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can stay within that range,
you're going to kill off any pathogens in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to kill off any insects,
weed seeds, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will maintain your aerobic
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the good guys will still survive
that process if you stay under 160,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is interesting because when I am
barbecuing or things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: they give you temperatures that you need
to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hot do I have to heat up a piece of
meat in order to kill off any bacteria in
[SPEAKER_01]: it that may be harmful to me without
overcooking it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, kind of on that note,
is it possible to add too much
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amendment when reusing soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any particular ingredients that
we should be using with caution,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for the case nutrient pack,
for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things to be careful of are
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like fish bone meal,
guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking with a manufacturer the
other day about bat guanos, and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: saying about the process that he's seen in
the Philippines, how it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from a sustainability perspective,
there's a lot of better sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus than bat guano, plus potential
for contamination, just with the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they're sourcing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that it's a manure-based
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like to watch my phosphorus
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one I think that's really
important to take a look at is what sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of heavy metals are we bringing into our
soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that I've been looking into a
lot more carefully lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've really started to move away from
soft rock phosphate or any rock phosphates
[SPEAKER_01]: for that reason, especially because of the
cadmium content in rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things like manure sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear about supposedly chicken manure
is supposed to be a lot higher in arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some chicken manure compost,
and the arsenic levels were actually quite
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is something I've heard
traditionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing your inputs, I think,
is really important to eliminate things
[SPEAKER_01]: like sodium, excessive amounts of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, your plant needs some of
that, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then watching our heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going too heavy with rock dust is going to
increase our heavy metal load without
[SPEAKER_01]: giving us a lot more trace minerals,
because your plant only needs so much of
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are sort of the starting points
for me when I start looking at inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: is finding out the source of them,
making sure they're as clean as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowing, yeah, if I had rock dust,
I'm picking up these trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm also going to get a little bit of
arsenic, a little bit of cadmium,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of chromium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially things that I want to keep at
very low levels, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's research that shows that cannabis
will take those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you happen to know, kelp's not a
bioaccumulator of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know it's a very common
amendment to soil that I use it myself a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's supposedly a lot of stuff in
the ocean that you might want to keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a good spec sheet on kelp
meal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can pull it up really
quickly while I'm chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, there is quite a bit in kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at the sheet real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would still be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime we're talking about these products
that have a lot of trace elements,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have the potential for things
to come in there that you may not want as
[SPEAKER_01]: high of levels of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at this analysis here,
and it doesn't look like they show it on
[SPEAKER_01]: this analysis, but that doesn't mean it's
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other thing to think about
when you're looking at a label or a spec
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't have arsenic listed on
there, is that because they didn't test
[SPEAKER_01]: for it, or because they didn't choose to
label it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just things to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one I see a fair bit of is
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other one you want to watch
that I forgot to mention before,
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some common sources of aluminum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it azomite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the one that contains a lot of
aluminum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so azomite is an aluminosilicate,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though the last time I looked at an
azomite, so for years I was always told
[SPEAKER_01]: that azomite was really high in aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the last test I looked at,
I don't remember seeing it being
[SPEAKER_01]: excessively high relative to other rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need to go back and take a look at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyone can go on there and look at an
analysis of azomite online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't pull it up really quickly in
the podcast, but that would be a good way
[SPEAKER_01]: to check yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should check that with all your
amendments and make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what our levels are with the
amendments that we're using in our
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're mixing your own soil,
it's a really good idea to track that
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, on that note, it brings me to the next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any soil testing companies that
you would recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything nation or worldwide that you
trust?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that more of a local thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of it is it's better to work with
a local lab because they're able to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you that information pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to work sending samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they'll have an agronomist there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem I see with cannabis is,
one, a lot of agronomists don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not making the best crop
recommendations from some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just default to tomatoes,
which is close, but it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other challenge I see with it is that
sometimes the labs can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this facility that I visited earlier
in the week, the lab had sent them totally
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just said, oh, oops, that was a
different customer's test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's trying to do crop analysis off of
this and making changes on a harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: that's worth potentially millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have consistent results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, when I get sent lab tests from
other labs that I haven't worked with,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets challenging for me because I have
to find out what's sort of tests are they
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they performing the test?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the methodology look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do these tests look like relative to
the tests that I'm familiar with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take the same sample and send it
to two different labs, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: two different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's quite high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to pick a lab,
stick with it, feel good about it in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of the way that they're doing the process,
and then base your analysis on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it gets way too confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lab that we've been using is Logan
Labs, just because that's where I started
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first started with Steve Solomon
and the intelligent gardener back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's who I've been working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those tests I can look at really
quickly and make really fast, actionable
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do do that, in terms of the Logan
test, you want to get the standard plus
[SPEAKER_01]: the extras and then the saturated paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the standard test is a maleic-3 test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you all of what's in the soil,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an acid extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one thing I want to
emphasize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've said in other podcasts,
don't get hung up on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not growing a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that plant looks great and
everything is good, don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever get a test back that
doesn't look right, have them retested or
[SPEAKER_01]: send in another sample, because you never
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have just gotten a little too
much fishbone meal in that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: sample that you took and it threw off all
your tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, it's just another tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The maleic-3 test, the standard test,
will tell you all of what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other test, the saturated paste,
is designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they're not perfect,
but it's designed to tell you what's
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plant right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I see just the saturated paste test,
that doesn't really tell me what's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: down the line in terms of nutrient
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm adding nutrients, it's a little
bit of a guessing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the first test only tells me
what's available to the plant right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's all is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't tell me what's currently
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I just put in a bunch of,
let's say, rock dust, that may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plant for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we may not see on the saturated
paste test the same levels of nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: availability that we would on the maleic-3
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people are using both those
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would rather stick with one
company than get Second Opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, because you said they'd be
different from different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you just send it to two
different labs and then compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: results and then kind of take it from
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're asking, why wouldn't we take the
same sample and send it to two labs and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see about what kind of the
differences in the results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason you wouldn't do that,
in my opinion, is just because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A different facility that I visited last
week did that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said the same thing, like,
man, these tests are so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you know which test is more
accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of got to just pick a lab you
feel good about and then really just use
[SPEAKER_01]: those results as guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I get a test back and it says the pH
is 7.3, the plants look great,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say, OK, maybe the pH in the
rhizosphere is a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's closer to 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm going to do is try and
mitigate alkalinity down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to make any drastic
changes, provided my plants look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use that soil test to kind of point
out anything that just looks really wacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I start seeing that over time my
calcium is getting too high and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to see less availability of
magnesium and potassium, then I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, no more calcium inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if the plants look good, let's start
upping some of these other cations as a
[SPEAKER_01]: way of improving the soil over time
without making any drastic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you mentioned pH, that brings me
to the next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to pH your water when growing
in the water-only organic living soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to still pH my water if the pH
range is really far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already 6.5 to, say,
7.2 range, I wouldn't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably just use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always like to get a water test,
and I like to know what's in my water so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can manage my soil fertility based around
what is coming in with my water source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something a lot of
people fail to do that's important,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you need to spend money
on, is getting these sorts of tests down
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know all of your inputs into your
soil and into your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I would start.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about pH too, every time I
bring it up, you'll see arguments online
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are like, I never pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't worry about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw away my pH pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to deal with pH when you're
talking about living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to talk about optimal plant
health and optimal plant growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: pH plays a huge role.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, my interview with Colin Bell,
who is the founder of Mammoth Microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth P, I'm not sure which podcast is
going to air first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling his is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be a little bit
outdated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing he talks about was the
research that he did relating to pH and
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial concentration and microbial
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about functional groups of
microbes, pH plays a huge role in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: determining what microbes are going to be
most active and thrive as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can create pH ranges that are
optimal for the functional groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that help plant growth,
it's only going to help our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely does play a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that being said, the reason I think
people are successful with throwing away
[SPEAKER_01]: their pH meter, and honestly, I don't have
one or use one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find with that is just soil in
general, especially microbially active
[SPEAKER_01]: soils like these living soils,
they're better at buffering pH than a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a hydro system, if your pH goes off,
you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants, you're going to see it right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with these living soils,
the plants are able to control that area
[SPEAKER_01]: much better based on the microbes that
selects for with the X states it's putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I love that you brought up mammoth
pee because that translates perfectly to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next question I had for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's become very popular lately that is
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started using it myself and had
great results in the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I remitted, as usual,
using the regular reamendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started noticing what I thought was a
phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was guessing that the
phosphorus-fixing microbes are using up
[SPEAKER_00]: the available phosphorus from the
reamendment faster than before I started
[SPEAKER_00]: using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I on the right path here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it OK to just add more
phosphorus-containing amendments every
[SPEAKER_00]: run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would probably recommend is get
that $30 soil test from Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be way cheaper than buying
more mammoth pee just to start out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's going to give you a good
idea of what your phosphorus levels are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, ideally, you'd get that complete test
and get the malec-3, the standard test,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the saturated paste so you can see not
only what phosphorus you have in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also what it's saying is available to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that that test doesn't
take into account these microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions that you're getting from
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have low phosphorus, then yes,
what's going on is definitely what you
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I talked to Colin
about that we don't really know is what
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of microbial persistence are we
getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: How well are these microbes surviving in
between cycles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they thriving as we re-amend that
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we killing a lot of them off to
where we need to reapply microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: products more consistently, like every two
weeks, every month, something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say, I was skeptical of mammoth
pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many microbial products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I come in with sort of a
skeptical eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why would I want to buy these
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the things that Colin talks
about, too, that I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important is it's not about any single
microbe or any particular species or
[SPEAKER_01]: strain of bacteria that you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about pest control,
that's a different subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're talking about fertility and
nutrient cycling, it's really this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: a consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these microbes work together in
fascinating ways that we don't even begin
[SPEAKER_01]: to comprehend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can't just take out and say,
OK, this particular strain of trichoderma
[SPEAKER_01]: has this effect by itself in situ,
and that it will translate when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about a complex rhizosphere into plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I like about mammoth
pee is they found that when they took the
[SPEAKER_01]: five, I think there's five strains of
bacteria in their in their mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they took one of them out and tried
it, they got some plant growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they added another one,
the same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they got all five together,
the sum was greater than the parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is this idea that they work together
to create sort of this this synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of what's going on in our
soils, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's an important factor to
consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what was going on with your
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, like I said, I was highly
skeptical of mammoth pee, but more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more facilities that I've been working
with that are using it, even with healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: living soils, are seeing really good
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't argue with the science of it if
I'm seeing wet weights going up 19 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: at Goldleaf and they're doing a very good
job of keeping controls to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not some other confounding factor
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I really do think there's
something to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very impressed with my first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know, keeping the controls
is a little bit more challenging for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was one of the only things I
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goodness, it was it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's interesting, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have another question related to
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your compost tea recipes and
what stages of growth do you use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, I'd refer people to our blog
page on kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put some links in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put together a document called a
compost tea guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free to download.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 18 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to fit as much information as
I could in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also some great recipes in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can go on there and download
that for free and see some recipes and
[SPEAKER_01]: really dive into compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of recipes, though,
I like to keep them simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high quality compost source is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have just a few things you have
to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about aerated compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a brewer that provides
good levels of oxygen, doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: dead zones, and can maintain your
dissolved oxygen levels above six ppm for
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's the goal of your brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have good input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to make sure that we're adding
we're adding a good source of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your compost source.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not adding in, you know,
things that could potentially grow
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens and disease causing organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked me the other day about,
you know, the risk associated with compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, if you're grabbing a
handful of soil outside and it may have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, potentially you're in an area
that could have root-knot nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, you could be introducing something to
your soil that could be really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using something that's gone
through the thermal composting process,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's much less likely to be less
likely to be a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your biology side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just adding a food source
for that biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we feed those microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the easiest way unsulfured blackstrap
molasses, a little bit of organic alfalfa
[SPEAKER_01]: meal from my microscope work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I find works really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a product called microbe catalyst,
because one of the things that Colin and I
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about in the mammoth pea podcast is
how different functional groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms respond differently to
different food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the microbe catalyst that we carry,
it's just a dry granule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dissolves in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more diversified in terms of
the amount of ingredients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hopeful that we'll get a more
diversified compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell that qualitatively looking
under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I need to do more trials,
but there's a lot of challenges around
[SPEAKER_01]: trialing and testing compost tea because
every batch you make is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you try, there's just too
much going on there and too much
[SPEAKER_01]: variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk a little bit about fungal
dominant teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a question I get a lot or I
see a lot online too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do I make a bacterial dominant
tea or a fungal dominant tea and people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like they want bacteria for veg or
fungally dominant for flour or these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I think to me, I think that's
the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're making compost tea,
the whole reason we're making it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase our nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want is a bunch of microbes
that are cycling nutrients with good
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and biomass in our tea brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really we're going to let the
environment and the plant sort it out from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at it as a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can make a balanced tea that has good
levels of microorganisms and good
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, and we put that onto the soil,
then the plant's really going to select
[SPEAKER_01]: for what it wants in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be putting out exudates that
are going to feed specific microorganisms
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to either improve the pH or
increase the availability of whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients it's lacking or wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not really in control of that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we talk about fungal to bacterial
ratios, which is something that I know the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web people get pretty far into
down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about old growth forest
versus undisturbed or when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: old growth forest versus prairie lands,
they have very different levels of fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: activity and fungal growth and biomass
relative to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're talking about growing in
container media or growing cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crop, it's a very different
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we want to do there is
just put out all the microbes we can and
[SPEAKER_01]: really let the plants control that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you make compost tea correctly,
you'll have good levels of fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always going to be bacteria in
your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can adjust all of this based on
your brew length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People talk about bacterial foods versus
fungal foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the easiest way to adjust the
amount of bacteria and fungus is just to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust to the length of time you're
brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first brew those first,
let's say, eight to 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are going to vary every
brew and also based on your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: air temperature, elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water source.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things are going to have slight
views.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very general thing I'm saying
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eight to 16 hours, a lot of bacteria
is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sort of that, let's say,
16 to 18 to 24 hours is when the fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: will start to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we start talking about going
36 hours or longer, 36 to 48 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have a lot more flagellates
and things like that taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time, we're just losing
diversity at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like to brew beyond 36 hours
because certain microbes are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient at consuming the nutrients
or each other, other microbes in that tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after 36 hours, diversity drops quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people want to start playing around
with that, do a brew at 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your next brew at 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to change your inputs
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the name of diversity, you'd still
want that eight to 16 hour brew for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria is going to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have bacteria in teas
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if we talk about a fungal dominant
tea, there's still going to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a one or the other sort of
thing, whereas it's just not going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungal content that you may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't the flagellates consume the
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I wrong on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your bacterial levels will fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the flagellates are going to take a
little longer to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at 24 hours, 36 hours, you'll still
have quite a bit of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a tea that's just going to be
mostly bacteria, use a sugar source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your compost and apply it at,
let's say, 18 to 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of on that note, is there a brand
of compost tea sprayer that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked into it recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a commercial sprayer that we use
that I tested with a microscope myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I would say is there are
companies out there doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dram is the first one that pops to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-R-A-M-M.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had one of their head guys,
Kurt Becker, on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they have a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't afford one of their sprayers,
because they are going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive, let's say you just had a small
home grow, go with a pump sprayer over an
[SPEAKER_01]: electric sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even just something like a sump pump with
your finger over the end of a hose is a
[SPEAKER_01]: better option than a lot of these other
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put compost tea in those little tiny
spray bottles that you squeeze with your
[SPEAKER_01]: finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of have a trigger on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may hold, let's say, a quart of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will kill your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put compost tea in an atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you keep in mind that it's a
living organism and we want to apply high
[SPEAKER_01]: volume at lower pressure, then you should
be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So larger droplet size is better than a
smaller droplet size, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcing motion with the application rather
than slamming the microorganisms at high
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure into a leaf surface or into the
ground is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I usually do with my applications if
it's not on scale is just go around with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a cup and just give each
plant a pint or two of compost tea as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't worry about over applying it,
because it's just beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were lucky enough to have a
microscope at home, is it possible to use
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever sprayer you have, spray it onto a
slide, look at it in the microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell if the bacteria is still alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you have a microscope,
that's really the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would spray it into a bucket from a
little further away and then collect it
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there, making sure that you clean
the bucket ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that way, you want to apply it like
how you'd be applying it when you applied
[SPEAKER_01]: it to your leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd want to stand a little further
back and apply it that way and check it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the sprayer and before the
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you brought up microscopes,
I know this isn't going to apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone, but I want to give a few quick
little pointers from Tim Wilson that he
showed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He shared with me back in a day that were
really useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started experimenting with
compost tea and using a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of microscope recommendations,
I have a guide that Tim Wilson put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on gardeningwithmicrobes.com or
microbeorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both have that guide available.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put together a really good description
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what he taught me is,
if I want to test out a compost or I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to test out how a compost responds to a
food source, it's very tedious to make up
[SPEAKER_01]: a compost tea brew every single time I
want to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of brews or a lot of brewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we take, I use a
container that holds about a cup of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and has a lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could do it in something even
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I figure out the ratios that I'm
going to be using in my brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I add those amount into my container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows me to make up like,
well, let's just call it a mini compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously I can't aerate that very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you'll do is you take it and you
shake it really, really well for like over
[SPEAKER_01]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get as much oxygen there as possible
and then take the lid off and leave it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll come back by periodically
every few hours and give it another,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the lid back on, give it another good
shake, take the lid off again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, it simulates enough of
an oxygen ratio response or keeps enough
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen in the water to allow us to get
kind of an idea of what the compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll set up like 12 or 15 different
things, testing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to test the compost,
I'll do this compost plus distilled water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I always use distilled water because
it's just going to be the cleanest water
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I'm not contaminating with other
microbes and I'm not using water that
[SPEAKER_01]: contains chlorine that's going to kill
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll say this compost plus
molasses, this compost plus alfalfa meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: this compost plus our microbe catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you'd be surprised when you
look under the tea at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, how much
those teas vary is shockingly dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you can start trying out
different iterations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have a good idea of what
direction you want to go, if you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, wow, you know, like for me,
we noticed this using, five different
[SPEAKER_01]: humic acids, we saw microbial suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually, we got less microbial
growth than we did over just compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we did that, we said,
okay, wow, so let's test this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we started doing, you know,
full size brews with humic acids and found
[SPEAKER_01]: that it actually supported that result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of way to test things out
without having to make up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different compost tea brews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have a large brewer that's,
you know, a hundred gallons, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have to brew up a hundred gallons
of tea every time you want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just doesn't, it's just not cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the takeaway is the diversity of
microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the big takeaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about soil health is
diversity and we see it in nature
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just in soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is health is healthier with
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about our own food and diets,
they always talk about diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's so important to every
ecosystem and all of ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not shocking that we need to support
that in our soils as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to shift gears a little bit
away from microbes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you read any scientific studies or
heard any discussion about the intentional
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing of plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it a little bit in past
podcasts, but I like that someone asked
[SPEAKER_01]: this question on Instagram because it's
something that I hear quite a bit around
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there is research out there that
shows that stressing a plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it to put more energy into,
you know, certain things that we want it
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce like fruit, or it's,
you know, in this case it's flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It thinks, so it thinks it's dying,
you know, or slowly senescing and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to put more energy into those things
or the things that help protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, defense mechanisms, which in this
case is the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny as a grower, every grower
knows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, oh man, I had this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw it out in the compost pile or I
just, something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gross cycle and all my plants freaked
out and yield went down, but oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the best bud I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff just finished so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, such a common story,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're talking about that
plant stress creating a response that's
[SPEAKER_01]: positive, but all that being said,
I just can't get behind us stressing our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because one, I think the most
important thing to keep in mind is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much every grow I've ever been to already
has plant stress going on at some level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already, there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so hard to maintain,
maintain the optimal conditions that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think most plants are going to be stressed
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to factor in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, we don't really know at what
stage of plant growth or at what point
[SPEAKER_01]: with what genetics this, these stressors
are going to be most beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know people will drop
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will water with cold water or stop
watering or stop adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone claims different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research just hasn't been there yet,
in my opinion, to really say that one
[SPEAKER_01]: method is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to this point, I just, I try to
eliminate plant stress as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, realizing fully that it's still
going to occur and until we can find more
[SPEAKER_01]: research on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically for cannabis, because there
already is this research around other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I think I've talked about this
too, but it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a study about how in, I believe it
was Italy with their tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would flood their fields with
saltwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that salinity would stress the
tomatoes and create a much more flavorful,
[SPEAKER_01]: higher antioxidant tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had the timing of this all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really interesting, but do we
know where that point is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how that exists with cannabis at this
point in time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: More research is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've interviewed a lot of really cool
people over the years on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which of the creative methods have you
incorporated into your own home garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I've, I've been really
fortunate that I've gotten, I've gotten to
[SPEAKER_01]: interview some really, really intelligent
people and that have done some really
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible work.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, in terms of when we talk about my
own home garden, the things that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporated on my farm were the stuff
from Steve Solomon and the intelligent
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started experimenting more with soil
testing and reamending to start balancing
[SPEAKER_01]: out these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, you know, I was just sort of in
that soil food work camp, food web camp,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we would just add, we would just
focus on biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This idea that if you got the biology
right, that all the nutrients would come
[SPEAKER_01]: into play and the plant would handle it
and you wouldn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I just don't, I just don't buy
into that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we start talking,
as I've gotten to meet a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists and people that are really
active in agrology and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just doesn't add up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the research supports the idea
that if we can create, if we can add
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to fix whatever limiting factor
of growth there is, then we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not all soils contain the same levels
of every nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty obvious
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure that we're getting
the plants the nutrients it needs and
[SPEAKER_01]: making, putting them in a form that's
going to be accessible to the plant so it
[SPEAKER_01]: can be as healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stuff from Steve Solomon,
I don't totally agree with all of his
[SPEAKER_01]: targets when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people can get too caught up
with soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to say, you know,
go too far down any one path, but I do
[SPEAKER_01]: think that a lot of what he says,
I love the introduction chapter,
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction to his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read nothing else in the
intelligent gardener or the numbers are
[SPEAKER_01]: too much, just read his introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it starts making you think about
nutrients and soil testing in a way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think is really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I do really appreciate the work that
Dr. Ingham did in bringing attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in this little food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that has a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of, like I said,
where I started my path because of my
[SPEAKER_01]: father and his compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm indebted to her for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't agree with everything
that she says regarding bacterial to
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal ratios and the stuff around
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's a lot of ways to grow a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to, you know,
I don't want to come across too harsh when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about all of these different
sort of ideologies around growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've had conversations off air
with people about is when I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you get too into any one of
these paths, whether it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF or probiotic farming or biodynamics or
soil food web or nutrient dense farming or
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming, you know, there's all
these different groups that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all, all of those are on the
organic side too, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they almost start to feel a little
more like a religion than like a
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where I sort of,
I think that's sort of where I separate
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't think you need to bury a
cow horn on a full moon to grow a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant necessarily, you know, and that's
not to say that's a bad practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if people want to go on doing that
fine, you know, but like for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of take bits and pieces from all of
these guys and then figure out what fits
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of not only just my growing
methodology, but also just sort of my like
[SPEAKER_01]: moral and ethical code and what feels
right for me in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people, it's really important to
them to, you know, plant with the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say it's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would love to do is try it out,
run a study, see, do I get better results?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all other variables being the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I plant when the moon is at a certain,
a certain stage in its cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my, my thing is let's, let's take a
critical eye to all of these approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: and then try and figure out what aspects
of them or what really makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kind of focus on that part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, Steve Solomon, I know I'm
getting off topic here, but Steve Solomon
[SPEAKER_01]: was really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jeff, Jeff's book team with
microbes is a really good starting point
[SPEAKER_01]: for learning about microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he kind of got me thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one who's had the biggest
impact on me just off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I don't, I know I may, I may think
of others down the road would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea of entomology and bio
controls was just a whole new world to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really got me thinking more about
insects in the insect world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a dino light and starting to look
at insects has been just a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Nelson Linsley is probably the
podcast that most opened my mind to
[SPEAKER_01]: different ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this idea of sort of a, a hybrid
approach using, you know, ionic nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and a more sustainable method,
which I thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Jaya Palmer is a great friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having him on was, was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and him and I have worked together
for years on research side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think, what I think probably
the most useful, like the most powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast I did might go to Dr. Alison
Justice and some of the research she
[SPEAKER_01]: shared that they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to pick like a best of,
of podcasts, but yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned something from every guest and
it's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I think that's the coolest
thing is I'm always learning and I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that never changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all should, and I think it's
great advice to compile bits and pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: from all different aspects of your
education to get a method that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone's different and you
know, there's more than one way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's some awesome stuff that
I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got one last question here and it's,
it's a doozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what challenges have you faced running
an independent nursery in an age when they
[SPEAKER_00]: are rapidly disappearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you stay independent yet relevant
in an increasingly commodified marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: while still paying the bills?
[SPEAKER_00]: What books are you reading that relate to
your work in professional growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me come back to the book question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I that's probably the one I'm the
most excited about right now talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we talked about that pre podcast,
but let me focus on the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you asked, could you repeat the first
part of that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what challenges have you faced running
an independent nursery in an age when they
[SPEAKER_00]: are rapidly disappearing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started kiss organics,
and set up kiss farm, I was getting really
[SPEAKER_01]: into victory gardens and there was no,
uh, there was no feed store in Redmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be fair, you know, we had the
compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd started mixing soils just to
experiment for my own growing purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I hadn't really dived into it that
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got this seven acre property back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my parents had had a nursery on
there before there was a nursery on there
[SPEAKER_01]: currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to do something differently,
different with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting into, uh, chickens and free
range animals, uh, for, for growing your
[SPEAKER_01]: own, your own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought urban farming was the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of tailored the business around
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I wasn't very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my, my mother made me do a
business plan back in the day because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was their land and they were helping,
uh, with some investment money,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I looking back now, I hated it,
but I think that was really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wasn't strong on the business side
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have done more research into how
much money you actually get for lugging
[SPEAKER_01]: around a 50 pound bag of chicken feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's really, it's really a tough
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having, looking back,
I wish I had been a little less idealistic
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little more pragmatic and done some
more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I had a good idea, but I didn't
really know where that idea would take me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also thought, you know, there's all
these cool edibles out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should offer unique edibles and be an
edible nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else is doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This urban food thing is, is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just went with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got all these, we spent all this
money and got all these really cool edible
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, um, really, really cool plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, why did I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it takes time too for things
to catch on and things to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't, I, I think I, I think I over
diversified our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had all these animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a preschool on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, um, you know, chickens running
around and ducks and goats and pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had, we had this edible nursery and
we were trying to keep all these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: alive and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was expecting a staff to be able to
know about picking pigs and chickens and
[SPEAKER_01]: ducks and you know, gummy berries and
elderberries and apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also too much too for me trying
to manage and run all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the first things I learned is
like, I'm not a great manager or leader of
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very good at self motivating and I
think I can come up with some good ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, like trying to,
trying to manage this huge thing was
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so looking back, if I, I think as if I
looked at this business over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never would have done the nursery
because I just didn't have the right staff
[SPEAKER_01]: in place to keep everything healthy and
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you really have to have a lot of
plant knowledge to have someone scouting
[SPEAKER_01]: and really maintaining that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't give it the energy that I
needed because I was too busy dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: something else all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we had, we had a whole
greenhouse we'd plant out every year and
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we would, we would do an okay job,
but we can never keep up with the weeding
[SPEAKER_01]: because we didn't have enough staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd have this whole nursery that
always looked okay, but we weren't able to
[SPEAKER_01]: always, you know, our irrigation would
break or we wouldn't, we wouldn't catch
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, a pest coming onto the
property fast enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things like that, or our chickens
would get feather lice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was always something happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it always felt like a crisis,
you know, starting a business is by far
[SPEAKER_01]: the hardest thing I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, I have memories of,
you know, working until six in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: and the rooster is crowing behind me and
I'm still making up tea brew kits in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage or sleeping, you know, in a tent on
the back of the property because I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take the 15 minutes it would take
me to commute home and go in my own bed
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go back to work the next morning,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking back at it, I don't regret a
single minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I wouldn't be the person I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I would have the
business that I have if I hadn't done
[SPEAKER_01]: those things, but I think I could have
been a lot smarter about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that I could have,
uh, set myself up to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I, had I been more strategic,
like put in a lot more time on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planning side and less time just trying to
put out fires, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked about books, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of that was, um,
so yeah, well, what books have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: reading that relate to your work in
professional growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one, this is probably the
question that's most, I'm most passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about right now because, uh, my,
my values and things have, have stayed the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd fairly much the same throughout
this whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was always really important to me
with our business that we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were an educational center.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all came from my parents,
mostly my father.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just so passionate about organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's passionate about the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a big hippie and he always will
be, and I love him for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he really shared this, this enjoyment
of nature with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the ability to allow children
and the public to interact with these
[SPEAKER_01]: animals and, and eat this healthy food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see this growing process has been
invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I don't regret that for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that, you know,
the one key thing I would tell people is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, stick to your values.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, even though the farm itself has
not been particularly successful relative
[SPEAKER_01]: to kiss organics, um, it's been like
emotionally and like spiritually valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: to not to the community and to myself and
to the employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's all been really,
really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things, some of the things
I've learned over the years now since then
[SPEAKER_01]: in running a business is a lot of the
books I've been reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give credit to my wife
because she is a marketing whiz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she made me realize that like,
it's not about having the best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, I'd say it's not about
having the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be the best grower in the world,
but if no one knows about what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, it, it, you're not going to ever,
you're not going to ever sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I'd never, I was always like,
ah, marketing and advertising,
[SPEAKER_01]: big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't need to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to focus on what I'm good
at and what I'm passionate about,
[SPEAKER_01]: which wasn't those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I, I deeply regret that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for anyone starting a cannabis
business out nowadays that's listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: this, get your marketing advertising going
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best piece of advice I can get
you build a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so like this podcast was my way of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's been, it's such a wonderful
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've learned that marketing and
advertising doesn't have to be a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be a drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be gimmicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you can, if you can find your
message and make it real, that's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the latest things,
um, on the marketing advertising piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: the two books that I really enjoyed was
contagious by Jonah burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go on YouTube and look him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes ideas, uh, what makes ideas
stick and what makes ideas take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love his books and, uh, made to stick by
chip Heath is another one along those
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can get a lot of good gems
out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we talk about like books
that have changed the way I run my
[SPEAKER_01]: business on the business side,
uh, there's a really, really good book
[SPEAKER_01]: called never split the difference by Chris
Voss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone should read it saved me
$1,200 within the first week of reading
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, it's a, it's a good book about a
guy who was like a, he was a terrorist
[SPEAKER_01]: negotiation expert, like the head of it
for the FBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he talks about all these,
all of his experiences from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking people out of, uh, you know,
talking people off the edge, edge of a
[SPEAKER_01]: building to buying a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just made me realize that like
everything in life is negotiable and it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is a negotiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the book is hilarious and so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the book I'm reading right now is
called the 80 20 principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's another book that's a
must read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned about it from the four hour work
week with Timothy Ferris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I don't want to say that you
should necessarily read the Timothy Ferris
[SPEAKER_01]: book cause it's he's a lot as you and I
were talking about for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to, I don't want to
necessarily say that that's the book to
[SPEAKER_01]: read, but the 80 20 principle is
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this idea that like 80% of your
energy goes into 20% of the things you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to equal a hundred,
but this is just rough things or 80% of
[SPEAKER_01]: your revenue comes from 20% of your
clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not put your energy into that 20%
or what I would say is like probably like
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of my time goes to 5% of my clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just require a lot more
handholding through this process,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they have complaints about your
products, or they have all these questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're just constantly spending time
like pointing them to links on the
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or, and more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm learning is like,
why am I putting all my energy into those
[SPEAKER_01]: people when I can be putting my energy
into the part of the business that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: important to me that I'm more passionate
about and that's more profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's a great book and you can
apply it to your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, you know, 80% of your happiness
is coming from the 10% of the time you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spent hiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you, how do you change your life to
spend that time, you know, increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time that you're doing,
doing the things that make you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great book, but it's all based
from an economy perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's fun too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then the last one I have to
mention is sort of a guy who's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: become a personal hero of mine over the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, his name is Jesse Itzler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's him and his wife are a lot of fun
to follow on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, she's the founder of Spanx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, which is, so she's like a
multimillionaire in her own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, he wrote a book called living
with a seal and the this book is just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of the best books I've ever,
I've ever read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious and powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also written a second book called
living with a monk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I can't recommend those books
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if I had to pick one book to tell
someone to read, it'd be, it'd be that
[SPEAKER_01]: book living with a seal by Jesse Itzler,
because it's just, uh, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this idea that we have the mental
power to, to really do whatever we want
[SPEAKER_01]: and do one big thing every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no reason we get stuck
in these ruts where we just go through
[SPEAKER_01]: life and do the same thing over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really challenges that,
uh, in a way that I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm now looking at my life differently
and thinking about how do I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really important to me,
not just with my business, but with my
[SPEAKER_01]: personal life and how do I value or take
the things that I value and really focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the biggest thing is I'm
getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of the growers and people
that listen to show are younger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about, I think about my time,
like, where do I want to be spending my
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, you know, sitting in front of the
computer answering emails, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: important reality of my job, or is it
spending time with my, with my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my wife and our soon to soon daughter to
be, that's, you know, going to be born
[SPEAKER_01]: here in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these life changes and like,
how do I, how do I center my life around
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that are really important?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hey, thank you so much for doing
