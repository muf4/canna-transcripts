[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with Kiss Organics and
today I want to talk to you about organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments and organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have in front of me here is the
majority of things that you'll find in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about each one sort of
off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not reading a script so I may not
catch all the bullet points that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will try and add any notes as well
as the actual NPK, the nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium of the various
products that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add those to the video later because
I don't have those all memorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to run through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be one really long form
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and bookmark the
different spots so you can look up
[SPEAKER_00]: particular amendments if you're curious
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially what I have out right now is all
things that contain NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be your major
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do another one with calcium and limes
as well as micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do one on compost and I'll do one on
some blended fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot and I only have so much room in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these things look very similar so
bear with me as I try and go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do, one of the first things I
want you to think about when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about organic fertilizers is
release rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the primary variables with release
rates is particle size and solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things are going to have
very large particle size like this neem
[SPEAKER_00]: seed meal or neem cake versus something
like this potassium sulfate or Epsom salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium sulfate, fully soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we're talking particle size like
this kelp meal is very, very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen kelp meals come in a variety of
different particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller the particle size,
the greater the surface area and the
[SPEAKER_00]: easier it is for microbes to break them
down and make them plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very general broad statement
that I'm making.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variables that will come
into play like what microbes are in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, what moisture levels are in your
soil, what temperature is your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things are going to play a role
in terms of nutrient availability but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the first thing I look at or think
about when I'm looking at an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I look at NPK, I look at particle
size so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off talking about primarily
nitrogen amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have closest to me here first is
organic alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now organic alfalfa meal is something that
I like to use in all of my nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't contain a lot of nitrogen so
you're not getting a lot of NPK out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per se, but it's a wonderful microbial
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds bacteria, archaea, fungi,
which in turn will feed protozoa and other
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're big on the soil food web thing,
adding organic alfalfa meal is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful because if you add too
much, it can cause the soil temperature to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up as the bacteria reproduce rapidly
and that could potentially pull nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from your crop roots or potentially cause
issues in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, it's a really good safe
amendment to use and something that I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to use in all of my gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next what I have here, I believe this is
the fish meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fish meal, it's primarily nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's derived from fish as you may know and
it's a fairly small part of the particle
[SPEAKER_00]: size here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the more expensive nitrogen
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you're gonna pay more for your
nitrogen if you go with fish meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer ocean based products
over things that might have come from our
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial slaughterhouses and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of cleanliness of the
product, heavy metals, exposure to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, whole growth hormones,
chemicals, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily any cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind because I have heard
some organic companies pushing that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of message and agenda and the science
doesn't back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna learn more about that,
you can go and take a look at a video I
[SPEAKER_00]: made on exactly that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to link to it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, fish meal, primarily nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're looking to make something
that is not using things like blood meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: feather meal, that is a good other
nitrogen source option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next I have soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soy meal is a great option for folks
who wanna create sort of a vegetarian or
[SPEAKER_00]: vegan mix or don't want to support our
industrial fishery, commercial fishing or
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial slaughterhouse loops of food
production for our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do wanna use only plant based
inputs, that's a great source for
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could use something like the soy
and the alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind with any of the plant based
nutrient sources that they can vary based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fertility of the soil and how that
crop was grown will impact the fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: of the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see some variability there,
but you can usually get a pretty rough
[SPEAKER_00]: idea by looking at the label as to what
you're actually getting for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just keep in mind those labels are not
100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using those and purely those
for calculating out what your NPK is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, I can tell you right now,
it's not gonna match up the way you think
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always soil test afterwards and are
always shocked with just how different it
[SPEAKER_00]: is when we start mixing and making soils
from what we expect using an NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on, neem cake or neem seed
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we have right now,
this is in the form of a pellet,
[SPEAKER_00]: a compressed pellet, but you can also get
it, at least we've gotten the past is like
[SPEAKER_00]: a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about the neem cake is
it's the residue that's left after the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed is pressed to extract the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how thoroughly they press
the seed, that will determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: azadirachtin content may be left in the
neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And azadirachtin is a insect growth
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's synthetic versions like azomax or
azotrol that you may have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to use neem oil as a
foliar spray to deal with various insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used the neem seed meal in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a number of years now,
because I think there's better options out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have used it at a rate of two cups
per five gallons of water that I bubbled
[SPEAKER_00]: for 24 hours, and then watered over the
soil to deal with a really bad fungus gnat
[SPEAKER_00]: infection that I had at the time,
or infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be used for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gonna give you a little bit of
nitrogen, but there's a couple reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to not use as much neem cake and
also the karanja cake, which I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first reason, and again,
all of this goes back to using the Kutz
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, and Clackamas Kutz back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reasons I moved away from these,
and I still use a small amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very small amount compared to what
Kutz mix was, or what I originally used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is one, the fossil fuel
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to get the product here,
to get the neem cake here from India is
[SPEAKER_00]: very expensive, and it has a high fossil
fuel cost to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think there's better nitrogen
options out here on this table that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more sustainable because I can source them
more locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear there was gonna be some neem
production happening in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: which potentially would be a little
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm making this video like you
live and are sourcing things in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States or let's say North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in India, neem cake is a
wonderful option for you for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for, I think, hundreds if
not thousands of years by farmers for
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, oh, the second reason,
and this goes for both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, is from talking to a good friend of
mine, she was consulting with a farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, and they actually failed for a
pesticide that is a chemistry that has not
[SPEAKER_00]: been allowed in the United States since
the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this farm was very confused as to
how they could have failed on their flower
[SPEAKER_00]: for this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what had happened is they
tracked it all down was the neem oil that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were spraying on their crop contained
low trace levels of this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what the pesticide was
off the top of my head, but I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not something that's been available
here in the United States for 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now, 50 years almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that it was on the crop pretty
much means that the farmers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the neem tree somewhere in that
production chain, it got exposed to this
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something with the neem cake,
the caranja cake, that's just something to
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of as a possibility, and it's one
reason to have a very clean source,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also realize that like I said,
there's better options we can find here
[SPEAKER_00]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably my favorite amendment
right now that I like to include in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my gardens and all of my soil
formulations, and this is insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the great thing about insect frass,
well, there's a number of things really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one being is it's closing an
ecological loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times these mealworms are
eating a waste byproduct and then
[SPEAKER_00]: converting that into grubs, which are then
sold as a high protein source for animal
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this frass is sort of is their
poop and leftover exoskeletons,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that remains there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wonderful thing about insect frass
is I have yet to see a sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've probably looked at three or four
different sources now over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of them have been very clean on
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to the low heavy metals,
which is really big for those of you that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in regulated states growing cannabis,
but even for people with our own gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: just for our own health, having something
that's really clean that is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: has, you know, nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium, and it's kind of a more
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced fertilizer option, and then has
microbial life in it as well, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is an insect manure, essentially,
that's what frass is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it contains high levels of chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so potentially that chitin could help
with disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not gonna hurt to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use it as my main form of,
you know, integrated pest management,
[SPEAKER_00]: but having it in your mix is certainly not
gonna hurt any things, and it has all
[SPEAKER_00]: those other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect frass, one of my favorite
amendments right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood meal is a very fast-release
available form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gross to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you wanna keep it very dry
until you're ready to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you need nitrogen, it's a good way
to get a faster-release nitrogen right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this goes back to that whole idea
of using, utilizing slaughterhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason you might wanna consider it is
because you are closing an ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the best use case for that
material is to grow more things with it
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than it ending up in a landfill,
or getting dumped, or polluting our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment by ending up in our streams,
or water supply, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by extracting and making a fertilizer
out of it, that's really the highest use
[SPEAKER_00]: case for a product like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I understand if there's people
that don't want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have seen research, and there's not
a ton of research on this topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, but the research that I
have seen that does exist shows that the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood meal is actually very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have high levels of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have high levels of any sort of
growth hormones, pesticides, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a very clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the bone meal as well,
which I'll get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's definitely something that
you should consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also will pick up a little bit of
iron from it too, because it is actual
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't use it in my garden all
that often, but I don't have a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with people that do choose to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple things in here that
aren't necessarily NPK, but I had already
[SPEAKER_00]: poured them into the bucket, so I'm going
to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is agricultural sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agricultural sulfur is these little
tiny pearl pellets in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add it to your soil as a way of
lowering your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a pH above,
let's say, 73, 74, and you need to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: it, this is a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a good way to slowly lower your
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, sulfur is associated
with a lot of terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having adequate sulfur is really
important to get all the flavors and odors
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want in whatever sort of flower
that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to get too much
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the only risk with sulfur is raising
the EC, the electrical conductivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil, so high that you may put
osmotic pressure on your plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to see a sulfur
toxicity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tolerant of high sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't usually worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, and again, this one, I kind of
poured it out before I decided to do
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to leave it in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about biochar, it is one of my
favorite amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right up there with insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include it in all of my soil
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reasons why are because it has a
ton of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with overall plant growth and
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's habitat for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sequesters heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does just a ton of really great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that using it at a rate of
about 5% to 8% by volume, we see better
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect to see such a dramatic
difference by such a small addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research really supports it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to keep in mind,
and this is something I'll talk more in
[SPEAKER_00]: depth about when I talk about compost,
but not all biochar is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure that you're
sourcing it from a company that's burning
[SPEAKER_00]: clean wood and actually pyrolyzing that
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means burning it at very,
very high heat and low oxygen conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, what you're ending up with is
something more like ash that can contain
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals and other contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a very consistent clean source
is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then particle size plays a big role,
too, like I talked about with surface
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having some smaller particle sizes,
it can act as an aggregate in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and give your soil more tilt, more
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the size that we use is fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably, I would say, the size of
maybe like a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you sort of a size analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, moving on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe this is feather meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feather meal is sourced from,
as you can expect, from the poultry
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feather meal can contain more contaminants
than the bone or the blood, but in general
[SPEAKER_00]: is another great option for nitrogen
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had originally read that feather meal
was a slow release nitrogen source,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I'm finding in practice with soil
testing and things like that is it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down more to particle size, at least in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, it's primarily nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other options if you choose
not to use anything from the
[SPEAKER_00]: slaughterhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crab or crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crab and crustacean meal is a good
source of nitrogen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to contain high levels of
chitin from the shells that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to contain some more calcium
for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't talked about calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get some calcium from the insect
frass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to go back to the insect frass,
depending on what insect it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it was mealworm or black soldier
fly, I think there's even a cricket frass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's commercially available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to be slightly different
NPK, slightly different microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: consortia, different calcium levels,
those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, getting back to the crustacean
meal, this is going to be a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of different crustaceans,
typically crab, lobster, those sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can add this to your soil
again, primarily for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, kelp meal, what we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, kelp meal is an interesting one
because it has a ton of plant benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great research on how
wonderful kelp meal is for plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains like 70 different elements in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kelp is this amazing dynamic
accumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because it is so good at accumulating
nutrients, primarily micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is also high in heavy metals,
primarily arsenic, from what I've seen on
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use it at lower rates now,
especially for people in states where
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals is a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we just look at it from a plant
growth perspective, it is a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: input and something to use in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use it, you can use it at pretty
low rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily need to use the high
rates that we originally were using when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were making coots mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this next one is known as K-mag or
solpo-mag or sulfate apotash magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a bunch of different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very high in sulfur,
potassium, and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be in the right
ratios for what you want of those
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep all of that in mind if you decide
to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rare use cases where I might use
it, but I don't use it all that
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is because I have
access to things like potassium sulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: and magnesium sulfate, Epsom salt,
which are both very, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can control the levels of potassium
and magnesium I'm adding separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like using Kalman like I
would never use Kalman because I'd want to
[SPEAKER_00]: add calcium and magnesium separately and
at different ratios, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: what my soil report or what my plant may
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same sort of thing with
solpo-mag or K-mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, you know, if you do need
to pick up some potassium and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more on the magnesium side, then it is a
good option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one other thing about it is it's very
soluble, which I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will get faster release rate with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these particular amendments,
particularly anything that's a sulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: here like these, they are refined,
but they are approved for use in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like the potassium sulfate,
these are mined products that are then
[SPEAKER_00]: refined and then allowed to be used if you
have a soil test showing a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, all of these products,
to a certain extent, have some level of
[SPEAKER_00]: processing or refinement that happens in
order to get to the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in this case, it's pelletized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these cases, they're made into meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind when you're
thinking about an amendment and deciding
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not you want to use something
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we have potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0050.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy way to get available
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid to late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's really going to bulk up your
flower, give you that nice density that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see these PK boosters and stuff on the
market in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that really probably
comes down to people having inadequate
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, either from over watering because
it's highly leachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're flushing your soils and
watering your soils to run off a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could be removing nitrates and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so later in the flower, you may need
to add some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's just one of those things that your
plant is utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a fairly high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure you always
have adequate potassium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the easiest ways to get
it in the organic system is through
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week three is a nice time to do a light
potassium sulfate application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would just be mixed with water
and watered in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very affordable input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we have magnesium sulfate or Epsom
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely do I need to add magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find with most living soil, we have
adequate magnesium already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I ever do see a soil reporter or
need to add it, Epsom salts the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it because it's very soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not using very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very easy to source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a wonderful option for you if you
do need to pick up magnesium in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did, this was crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, oh, this is fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, they look very similar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put them all out and I didn't label
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to test myself to see if I
can do it all visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish bone meal is, again, it's from the
commercial fishing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in phosphorus, but you're also
picking up some nitrogen with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew you wanted to just be aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the phosphate in it, it's a good way
to pick up phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfectly clean on heavy metal
tests from what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, there really is not a
perfect phosphorus source that either
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't gonna give you calcium or
potentially bring in some heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's certainly ones that are
cleaner than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one that I'm getting tested
right now that I'm super excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: that may actually be the holy grail of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's derived from algae, but I haven't
gotten the test back yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you guys posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we do like to use fish
bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your options for phosphorus in organic
systems are fish bone meal, bone meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gonna be your main sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about the other two next
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, fish bone meal, again,
source from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as clean as some people may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it out to be, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bone meal is actually cleaner
when we talk about heavy metals and we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about things like growth hormones,
the pesticides, fungicides, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no GMOs making it into the bone
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's research that shows that doesn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things from the ocean, not necessarily
cleaner than things from the land,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're talking about products like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, manures, on the other hand,
and compost, absolutely, you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: higher levels of contaminants in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bone meal is the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One concern that people have with bone
meal is mad cow's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really hasn't been an issue,
but it is a prion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something where I just, if I am
using, well, any of these amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna wear a mask and wash my hands
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But statistically, you're more likely to
get in trouble driving your car or doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your daily tasks than you would from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one fear I've heard associated
with bone meal, so I just wanted to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have bone meal, fish bone
meal, and then lastly, soft rock
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, soft rock phosphate is a mined
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is gonna contain higher levels
of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one that I have here is
Calphos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the cleaner soft rock
phosphates that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a larger particle size here,
so the availability is gonna be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we usually use a combination of the
fish bone and the soft rock, the Calphos
[SPEAKER_00]: in our mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ones like Fertrell that
we've tested, and they have higher levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we primarily recommend the ones that we
found to have lower levels of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the overview of NPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is not exhaustive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't have everything, but this is
the majority of what you'll see in your
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna clear these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna replace them with some other
amendments, and I'm gonna continue the
[SPEAKER_00]: video here shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm back, and I've got a new
set of amendments laid out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna start off talking about limes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because limes all look relatively the
same, I didn't bother putting them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looked like a whole bunch of white
flour laying out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna talk about the differences,
because it's really important to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: right lime or the right calcium amendment
into your soil for the effect that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I wanna talk about is
agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, agricultural lime is great if you
want to raise your soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will have a dramatic impact on soil
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're low, this is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the ones that we like to use
are a very, very fine flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna impact your release rates,
but you could consider using different
[SPEAKER_00]: particle sizes to get different release
rates on the calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calcium's one of the most important
things to preload and have high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: through veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I have dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, dolomite lime is calcium and
magnesium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this does is this is going to have
an even greater effect on raising soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, it's gonna
provide you with magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I found is in most cases when
you're mixing soils, you have adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium and you don't need to add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I rarely use dolomite lime because I
prefer, again, I think I talked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but I prefer to add my magnesium
and my calcium as separate amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the correct ratios that I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dolomite does not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some rare cases where we
might use dolomite lime if we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise soil pH, add calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is a viable option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it's not a terribly
popular amendment that I like to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next and one of my favorite calcium
amendments is gypsum, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing about gypsum is it
buffers soil pH and that it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dramatic impact on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the calcium being a cation and the
sulfur being an anion, they offset each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and you end up with a relatively
neutral impact on your overall soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if your soil pH is already 6,
8 to 7, 2, let's say, and you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go any higher, then you can add gypsum
to your soil to get more calcium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about it also is the
fact you're also picking up sulfur and you
[SPEAKER_00]: really don't have to worry too much about
a sulfur toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cool thing about gypsum is the
solubility level of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, it's just not terribly soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solubility of it, the release rate
of gypsum is relatively slow, meaning it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give you pretty optimal release
rates of calcium throughout the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're starting out mixing a soil
and you're starting with peat moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that has a very low pH,
you'll typically add something like the
[SPEAKER_00]: egg lime and the gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get different forms of calcium in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna raise your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna not raise your pH,
but give you release of calcium throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people have recommended or using
oyster shell flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very similar to the agricultural
lime and frankly, the gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference there is it's derived from
oyster shells, but it's also a mined
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are bed deposits that are mined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they're pulling this out of
the ocean and getting you like the oyster
[SPEAKER_00]: shell flakes that you might have used if
you had chickens, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also primarily just calcium
carbonate as well with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cannot find agricultural lime
affordably, then this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't go out of my way to try and
find oyster shell flour to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural lime as they're gonna have
very similar effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's gonna raise soil pH and
provide you with high levels of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly here, I have molastinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's calcium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, molastinite is a little bit harder to
find for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are able to find it,
it's a wonderful option and something I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely like to include.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was formulating an ideal soil mix,
I would use a combination of gypsum and
[SPEAKER_00]: molastinite with probably a little bit of
agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the big difference here is you're
getting silica, which has a ton of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've talked about it in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is the magical, nutrient element
when it comes to growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica helps with drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with thicker cellular,
thicker cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps mitigate micronutrient toxicities
if you have a little too much boron or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too much manganese in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has so many different benefits for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all that being said, calcium silicate
will give you that calcium and also
[SPEAKER_00]: silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a wonderful option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it does raise soil pH, but much
slower than agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a soil test that shows a very
low soil pH, let's say it's like five,
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six, I'm like, wow, I got to get
this up before, you know, right away for
[SPEAKER_00]: this next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to use molastinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use agricultural lime or oyster shell
flower is something that's going to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: my pH much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your soil pH is close to being in
range, you just want a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: upward pressure on your pH, then
molastinite is a wonderful, wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: option to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your limes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk compost next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all composts are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do a whole thing on compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let me know in the comments
below if that's something that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way the compost is made,
what the feedstock is, how that compost is
[SPEAKER_00]: treated can have dramatic impacts on the
biological and chemical and physical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different types of
compost out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see you'll see different ways of
making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main three forms of compost are static
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you throw stuff in a pile and
let it sit for a year or two and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks down slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of that, very little labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage, it's not going to kill
off weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to kill off pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next option is vermicomposting or worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some examples of those
here and I'll put them up on the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll supersede it over the video hopefully
so you guys can see some closeups of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But worm casting is where you use worms to
break down the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called vermiculture or vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The castings is essentially worm poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tend to be some of the highest
quality from a biological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms are just very good at breaking
things down into a very plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant friendly forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last form, oh and I want to
mention that worm castings do not,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do not kill weed seeds and they do
not kill pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one option that does do those
things is thermophilic composting or
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocomposting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you heat a compost up by
balancing the carbon and nitrogen ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: to 161 degrees for 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, sorry, above 141 degrees but
below 165 I believe is the current
[SPEAKER_00]: standards for composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thermal process and turning the
pile will allow for the aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms to create this exothermic
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It heats up the pile as they reproduce
rapidly and that kills off the weed seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and kills off the pathogens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So optimally, and it's very hard to find
commercially, you would do a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things where you would take a
compost, you would thermally heat it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would then let some worms work through
it or maybe a static, statically compost
[SPEAKER_00]: the material longer after it's gone
through this thermal process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to create your most
biodiverse, high quality compost from a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's available commercially for
compost is mostly worm castings and
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocompost because of that pathogen
requirement that you usually have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I find on the market typically for
commercial compost is pretty poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've searched around our area to
see what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Northwest, these are the best
composts that I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is this Olie Mountain
fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two year aged fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very dark, rich color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a fair amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reasonably low in heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do use a little bit of post consumer
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is yard waste in there,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will on occasion come across little
bits of plastic or other things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big thing that they do well,
I think, and frankly, the quality has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little bit in the last few years,
I feel like, is they age the compost for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum of two years after thermally
composting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key difference,
I think, in quality, because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial compost that you see on the
market are really only composted for like
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're turned really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just don't end up with
something that's necessarily a finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can cause issues with there being
high levels of ammonium, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: still cycling, the biological communities
in those composts are just not as evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: or as beneficial for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find yourself a high quality
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a side note, if you're formulating
a soil mix, it should always start with
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: These recipes I see online where people
just list a bunch of ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: those recipes, your results are going to
vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, because everyone's compost
source is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compost brings in a fair amount of
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to account for that when
you're mixing and formulating a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the ole fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that one that we discovered in the
last couple of years is this lane compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the look of the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've done with them is they have
a fish compost as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like fish compost in general,
but they can be high in heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done with the lane compost
is we've taken their garden compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: their fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it specially blended just for us
at 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had that tested for heavy metals
and for fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've created soil mixes around
that blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I like because
it's significantly lower in heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing good overall plant growth
and health from using the lane compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they do use a small amount of post
consumer waste, but I think less than what
[SPEAKER_00]: I see in the ole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either that or they're they're filtering
it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tend to I tend to like this compost
myself a little bit better than the ole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of my go to for the most
affordable, high quality compost I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: available here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do sell all of these composts on
our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find something locally that
you want to use in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one that I have is the highest
quality commercial compost that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Seacoast compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually doing a biodynamic
process, which you can read about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a variety of different preps that
they do specifically for their compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also use fish products to make
this compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no post consumer waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about plastics
or any sort of trace residues of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that gardeners might have thrown in their
yard bin that may not have broken down as
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly as you may like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the Seacoast compost
shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our cannabis growers that are in
regulated states for heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we now do a blend with this compost
because it is by far the lowest heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal compost that we found on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a wonderful alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's just more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs us more to ship it here because
they're a small outfit on the coast of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shipping cost is higher and the
cost of the compost for them to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: and produce it is higher too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a little more room in your
budget and you are concerned about heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals or plastics and things like that,
this is a wonderful option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I'm currently using in my garden
since we've discovered it and started
[SPEAKER_00]: formulating with it over the last couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call this our fungal compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: product, though we take a combination of a
few different worm castings and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add nutrients to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like organic alfalfa meal,
for example, as a way of awakening and
[SPEAKER_00]: invigorating the biology, specifically the
fungal communities in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use this for making compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we call it a fungal compost,
but it contains all sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that that we really
like using, like I said, in compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also top dress your plant with
it and things like that as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what this product is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a worm castings that is made
from African worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the most visually appealing
compost worm castings I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The African worms take a little bit larger
poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have these little tiny,
very rich, fertile balls that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try and put a photo up of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very clean, nice looking
compost that is made from African worms
[SPEAKER_00]: that is is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has good biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've used it for years, similar to
the fungal compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this makes up a portion of our
fungal compost recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so again, to recap, if you're thinking
about a compost, do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a chemical analysis from the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a heavy metal analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out exactly what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask them what they're using to make the
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that what you're starting
with is high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost fraction, I can't emphasize
enough just how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, moving on, though, to what I have in
front of me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what's left of amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have on this side some some blended
craft fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here I have some trace
minerals and just a few things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't I didn't get to talk about in the
last video because I ran out of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one over here, this crazy looking
blue crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is copper sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So copper sulfate is a great option if you
need to raise copper levels in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you're using the tiny amount of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking fractions of teaspoons in
most cases for home growers because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: highly concentrated and you you don't want
to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is good research to show high
levels of copper will help with some
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pressures, apparently on the
pathogen side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with all of these trace
minerals, I would say be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, with our soil testing analysis
that we offer through KISS, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically give trace mineral
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for this is because we
typically don't see deficiencies in living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils related to trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually something more like their
watering or your macronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus,
those sorts of things that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that you're going to see issues with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rarely is it trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once all of those things are dialed or
if we get a leaf tissue analysis that
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely shows us that we have a trace
mineral deficiency, then we'll begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people don't want to use this
because, you know, it's blue crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously been refined and processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is approved for use by the National
Organic Program for organic production if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can show you have a deficiency based
off a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for those people that don't want to
use something like that, hold on,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me show you what else there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are products like this product
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is biomin boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they're doing is they're
taking that copper sulfate, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: chelating it, so bonding it with like an
amino acid or some other organic molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then essentially selling it to you as
a lower concentration in this case liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: form of copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would use this at slightly higher
rates so it's easier to dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of companies that
offer products like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to have the biomin one with
me, but you can't find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, also approved for use in organic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on to manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have started adding manganese to
our recommendations in very little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the safer trace minerals to
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're gonna go down the route of
trace minerals, I would start with
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are two different options for
manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one's a very fine powder and
one is a little tiny ball essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for these sorts of amendments,
if you're adding them to soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to mix them with water and then
water them in to get a more even
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we're talking parts per
million on these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the powder primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for my last soil run,
I added two teaspoons per yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, like I said, very small,
small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so moving on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same sort of thing as the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a white powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would use it in very, very small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next we have iron sulfate or ferrous
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now iron is tough because iron is just not
available in the pH ranges that our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be happy in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron becomes most available I think in a
pH round of four to four and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: which frankly is not practical for growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to higher levels,
it oxidizes almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some ways around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, Bryant, soil doctor consulting,
he's talked about creating little pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil near the plant roots where you
put a bunch of iron sulfate in there
[SPEAKER_00]: together as a way of maybe allowing plants
to access iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see low iron, that's where you see
a lighter yellow color around the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: center of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants will typically outgrow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I rarely do a lot in regards to
addressing iron just because it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: tricky in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we seem to hit sufficiency already in
most cases, but one of the ways that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can look to do that is through iron
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I think that's the main trick to
get rid of iron sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have boron in front of me,
but it's gonna look very similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boron is one you want to be especially
careful with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is needed for plant processes,
but in very, very low rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we rarely add boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do be aware that there's a big
difference between borax, which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: People use it for laundry and cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solubor, which I believe is like six to
eight times stronger levels of boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're adjusting
your application rates accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something like this, which I think is
only like six to eight percent boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just make sure you don't over
apply boron because some of these trace
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals can actually cause soils to be
infertile or inhospitable to plants by
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on to mineral applications in
the form of like rock dust and these these
[SPEAKER_00]: other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we have Jersey green sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's higher in potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a general rule with these rock
dusts, I first started using these at
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly high rates because of the work of
Steve Solomon and Clackamas Coot saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that trace minerals are really important
to plants and we want to make sure to have
[SPEAKER_00]: good levels in there by getting a lot of
natural rock dust and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: into our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally I was using these products
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've since backed off quite a bit for a
few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they're really heavy, like shockingly
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to raise the weights of
your soil, which for us is big because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're shipping soil in some cases to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can lower our weights,
that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest reason though is because of
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these rock dusts, anything that's
derived from, you know, that's mined is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have levels of heavy metals and
rock dusts are going to have it in higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels than some of these other products
like gypsum and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where the where the rock dust is
aligned from will have a dramatic impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the chemical composition of the rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the rock dust that we sell and use,
the one that I like the best is this
[SPEAKER_00]: basalt and it has the lowest levels of
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's paramagnetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people believe that that has plant
growth properties or plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to use a rock dust, that's the
one that I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I was using them at much higher
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use them at nearly the rates I
used to anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing with this and
something I've learned from working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of soil scientists and experts,
expert agronomists from the podcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: that these rock dusts are not typically
very plant available in the period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want results in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking months to years,
potentially decades for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we have access to other ways to
get these minerals much, much faster with
[SPEAKER_00]: release rates that we can understand and
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the of the minerals and rock dust
and things that you see here, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: glacial rock dust, which again,
fine powder, especially important,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, with these rock dust is the
particle size and surface area in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly microbes can break them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get a much finer powder or
micronized version, it's going to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more available than larger chunks or
larger particulate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a luminous silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a mined product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not something that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some growers really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I think there's better ways to
get trace minerals than than azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will bring in other things that you
may not want, like aluminum and other
[SPEAKER_00]: other heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here, this was the example of the the
African worm castings that actually put
[SPEAKER_00]: into a thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, humates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These this is from a company called Live
Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mined product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humates are the humic acids and humates
are, in theory, what happens when a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material is broken down through that
composting decal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is left at the end is higher in
chelation property, so it's better able to
[SPEAKER_00]: bond with other minerals and nutrients and
has some variety of plant properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most the humic acid products are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mined typically or typically
extracted from Leonardite, but which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular rock or mineral, there are
other ones that are derived from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's essentially what you're
looking at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more research in the last
decade around humic substances and their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would throw the caveat out there that
you do have levels of humic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using compost already,
you may see benefit to adding more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research that I've seen is a bit
varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that I use a ton of,
but I do appreciate the there is research
[SPEAKER_00]: to support the use of humic substances in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am hoping to get an expert on to
talk more in depth about it here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, next I have malted barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea behind malted barley grain is
that and this is this is all from
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamascoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where this all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the nutrients, all the nutrients
of the plant needs is contained in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take that seed and we sprout
that seed and then arrest that sprouting
[SPEAKER_00]: process, that's what essentially malting
is that we use for beer making and other
[SPEAKER_00]: other beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what that does is that that
stops that enzymatic process at its
[SPEAKER_00]: highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we originally started,
what we had everyone doing was sprouting
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and then grinding them up and then
applying that as a way to raise the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymatic levels in your soil and pick up
a variety of different enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've since moved on to malting to
the malting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just much simpler and easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done professionally for you
consistently, because if you let the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: go too long or you don't apply it right
away, you can end up with alcohols or
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that could damage your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I did some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some trials with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my garden, and I didn't get the plant
response that other people have claimed
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I just want to share why
growers are doing it and the theory behind
[SPEAKER_00]: why they might use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see some actual research
come out on this in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's that's where the malted
grain comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially, you would just grind
it up in a blender and then top dress it
[SPEAKER_00]: water and over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should see better overall plant
growth and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people claim their plants just
explode in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I did not get that response myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean it's going to be the
same for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, corn gluten meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw this one in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just forgot to do it in the last video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something we sell a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it sold in big box stores as
a weed pre emergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when corn gluten meal, it's hard to
say, is applied to lawns at the right time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring, it can help prevent weed
seeds from germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have some of those properties,
but it is also a source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to mention it, but it's not
one that I recommend or use a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now what I have left here are all
various blends of organic amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes that's easier for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you don't want to go through
the trials and tribulations of mixing your
[SPEAKER_00]: own and you want something that you know
is going to be consistent or give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: expected response, this is this is a good
option for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I have here, this is what
we call our microbe catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does have some nutrient level or
fertilizer level in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we use this for is after testing
a variety of different recipes and
[SPEAKER_00]: products, we ended up using this microbe
catalyst as a essentially a microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we make compost teas, for example,
in a five gallon brewer, we would use a
[SPEAKER_00]: half a cup of this with a tablespoon of
organic alfalfa as our food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a much better overall growth of
microbes across all sets of microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: and better diversity in biomass than if we
were just using molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, if you live somewhere
where you have easy access to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: black fat molasses, that is another
alternative that you can use for making
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molasses is also sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the other reasons
that we really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the microbe catalyst that we
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one I have here, this lighter colored
one, is our bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this product right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The KISS bloom booster is something that
Andrew on our team worked really dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: two years almost in formulating to get
just the right ratios of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments to give us the highest levels
of available P and K, just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, and then the absolute cleanest
heavy metals report in regards to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom boosters that I've seen on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so clean on heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are worried about heavy metals,
which frankly, it's something I think
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone should be thinking about,
or if you're in a regulated state where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tested for heavy metals,
this is a wonderful option.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product here, this is Solomon's
Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, this is Steve Solomon's
recipe for making a complete organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to mention with this
is this is designed for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-rich, mineral-dense vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not made for maximizing your cannabis
harvest or yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve acknowledges that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have the same ratios or
levels of fertility as some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I'm going to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it will do is it will give you
much higher levels of trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve is a big proponent of using these
trace minerals in low levels as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: raising the overall nutrition of the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there isn't a ton of research on
this topic, there are a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are using this for their vegetable
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they aren't doing soil testing,
this is sort of his best guess recipe for
[SPEAKER_00]: what he thinks your garden might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Steve Solomon COF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is our mineral mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you want to get a combination
of these limes and some rock dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: those sorts of things without buying all
the individual products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get some calcium as well
as some trace minerals in the form of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust, again, rock dust are not my
favorite, but we do make this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is available for people who are
looking for something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if you had a garden and
you already had the macro nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: you just wanted to add some more trace
minerals and you weren't in a rush for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be immediately available to your
vegetable garden, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an option in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this last one here, this is our
nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we started as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I formulated this and we've made little
tweaks to it, but I formulated this 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot, maybe even I think, yeah,
probably about 15, 20 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, is this is the nutrient
portion of our soil mix for our water only
[SPEAKER_00]: and our biochar soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't, or if shipping soil to
you is not practical because you're on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the country, for example,
and you can mix your own soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't want to guess at the
minerals and nutrients that your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: might need, this is a great way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a whole example on the page of
a walkthrough, how you would use this
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be top dressed, similar to our
bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these products are registered
for use in organic production for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we took a long
time to come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're reamending your soil or
you're mixing new soils, this nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: pack is a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this product right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that being said, I have a few other
products kind of floating around here that
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on before we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I have this, this is from
Dino Myco.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've done a lot of videos and I have a
blog post on mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to talk a little bit about it
in here because it's, it's sort of part of
[SPEAKER_00]: what people do when they're growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizal fungi is a particular
species or species or classification of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus that forms a symbiotic relationship
with the roots of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a variety of different species
of mycorrhizal fungi and they can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in this product,
we have Glomus intraradices and Glomus
[SPEAKER_00]: mossiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two are, have a relationship
with fruit trees, cannabis, most
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, not brassicas though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you would use this would be a
one-time application directly to your
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of your plant when the plant is
young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for things like lettuces, I probably
wouldn't bother with it for things like
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, peppers, maybe your cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we'll see, what you'll see by adding
a product like this is higher uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and other nutrients,
better drought resistance and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ability to cope with different
environmental abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizal fungi is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing about it is for people who
are concerned about heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated States, I've kind of shied away
from this because there is research that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows that mycorrhizal fungi will increase
the uptake of heavy metals, which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense because it increases the uptake and
flow of nutrients into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very mutualistic relationship that
it has with your plant and your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, that's the one case,
use case where I wouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when shopping around for a mycorrhizal
product, there's a few things to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may, you may look on the back and
see propagules or CFUs or spore count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where things get really
confusing because there are different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, some are endo
mycorrhizal fungi, which in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: most, most of our plants, like this,
like fruit trees, vegetables, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these glomus species fall into that
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other mycorrhizal species that
are ectomycorrhizae and those actually
[SPEAKER_00]: form a sheath around the outside of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these infect inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot see endo mycorrhizal fungi on a
plant root without staining the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking with a microscope,
I hear people say, oh, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they see, you know, little white
fuzziness around the healthy root and they
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, that has mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just healthy root hairs in the case
of vegetables, fruit trees, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have a conifer, then
ectomycorrhizae is the type of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look on some of these
labels, you may see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, we have 700 propagules per
gram of glomus entoradices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty high, high level,
assuming that this package contains what
[SPEAKER_00]: it says it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole nother thing within the
gardening industry is you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily trust these labels to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I trust this company, but that doesn't
mean I, you know, there's research through
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oregon department of ag that shows
that many of these companies and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: list on the labels are not always a
hundred percent what's actually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may see one that shows 2 million
spores or CFUs per gram of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's ectomycorrhizal fungi,
it's not going to form a relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't really count those
towards you getting a good infection
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to buy the right type
for the plant that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't emphasize that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to that, this product is,
you know, glomus entoradices, glomus
[SPEAKER_00]: mossiae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find another product like pumpkin
pro, for example, that may have glomus
[SPEAKER_00]: entoradices, also called rhizophagus
irregularis, just to further complicate
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's made somewhere else by a different
company that's producing it, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a slightly different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, you may get
slightly different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a whole podcast with the creator
of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he talks about
is the strain that they're using of glomus
[SPEAKER_00]: entoradices was developed out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came from a very harsh environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very good at dealing with a
variety of environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: including a lack of water, like drought
stress and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see any of these microbial
products, what we're talking about here
[SPEAKER_00]: is, one, they're not going to be all the
same, even if they have the same name like
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not necessarily getting the same
strain or species of trichoderma if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying it from different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to try different ones to
get different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just have to keep in mind,
too, that these will give you good results
[SPEAKER_00]: if you use them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, enough on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so this is our compost tea kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where our company started before I
ever got into these amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a wonderful blog on compost tea if
you want to read more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost tea is not a silver bullet,
as some people may tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does do is it increases the
biological activity in your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially, because you're adding a lot
more microbes and it can increase nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the key thing to think
about is is increasing nutrient cycling in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our kit, this is what we'd use in
our five gallon microbulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compost, which contains the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the food source to feed that
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into the brewer, which creates the
optimal environment for these microbes to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take that tea and apply it to
our soil or to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's important to understand that
compost tea is not the cure-all for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in certain cases, people can get
pretty dramatic results from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to give you a little bit of
fertility, primarily nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to account for,
too, when you're making and using compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is EggSil 16H for potassium
silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what many of the silica products
on the market are derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a powdered form and the
advantage being cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take this and make your own
silica, your own gallon of silica out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound of this for pennies on the dollar
compared to what they charge to give it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a fancy bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 32% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negligible amount, though, when you think
about how much you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take something this size,
add it to a gallon of water, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: shake it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use it at a rate of a teaspoon or
two per gallon of water of that liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate that I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're not using very much,
but this is a great way to get silica
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you could water with every
watering or every other watering
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout your plant's life cycle to get
a lot of the benefits of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, I have the Pacific Grow
Oceanic Fish Hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make a product called Seafoss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's not sitting here is
because I used it recently with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a little bit higher in
phosphorus because it's stabilized with
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fish hydrolysis, Seafoss, these types
of products are sort of your cheap bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: formula or grow formula, liquid formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the few liquid products that I
really like to have on hand because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff I've talked about so far,
it takes a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take five to 10 days for you to
really see a plant response after
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a plant that's low in
nutrients, we don't wanna wait that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't wanna let it suffer for that long
because that's gonna impact its overall
[SPEAKER_00]: health, make it more susceptible to
diseases, more susceptible to pests
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's stressed out, and it's gonna
impact our overall yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those cases, if I see I have a
nitrogen deficiency, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm seeing a lighter yellow plant
yellowing leaves at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hit it with something like this
and maybe do a top dressing of a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment at the same time as a way to get
some immediate end to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll probably do a few feedings
of something like this to kind of spoon
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the other way I use this or the Seafoss
is if I'm halfway through the cycle and I
[SPEAKER_00]: realize I under amended my plants,
then I can kind of spoon feed them
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like I would if it was a
bottle of nutrient to get them through the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have really little plants,
seedlings, things like that, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: another great way to dose for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fertility at low levels for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one bad thing about fish hydrolysis
is it stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really strong smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one downside to these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I really like to use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we primarily are using microbial mass
now and actually the founder of Mammoth P,
[SPEAKER_00]: Collin Bell, who I've had on the podcast,
a good friend of mine, he's over there at
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial mass too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually knew the founders of
microbial mass way back in the day when
[SPEAKER_00]: they first were getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're great folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth P was sort of that first product
on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually no longer around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's left of my supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had one here, so I thought I'd
show it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by adding specific microbes,
in this case, pea-solubilizing microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get better nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually a fair bit of
research around using these sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are very targeted versus something
like compost tea, which is just a shotgun
[SPEAKER_00]: approach of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just putting out all the microbes
that were in the compost and seeing which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones the plant might want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas here, we're targeting it with very
high concentrated levels of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that we know do specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm showing you Mammoth P only
because I'm using this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be switching over to
microbial mass, which we do have available
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing to talk about is silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already talked about the benefits
of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things to know about silica
is availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to do a deep dive on this,
I did a podcast with Dr. Wendy Zellner.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a silica expert and explained it
much better than I will in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, there's three different
sources of silica that we can use in our
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have different availability to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one would be amorphous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this egg sil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the most plant available
forms of silica because it converts it to
[SPEAKER_00]: silicic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant can take that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one would be biogenic silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be something that's just
essentially plant derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear of silica derived from rice
holes or from bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a biogenic source of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue with that is just you may be
picking up heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be as available as
amorphous forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last form is quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quartz is literally rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what these sorts of products
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not picking on this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one problem I have with these products
is we don't know when or how available
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding from talking to Dr.
Zellner is we're talking a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: months to years before this silica becomes
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's so many variables in
terms of when it would become available,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how much weathering has occurred,
the particle size, the moisture level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes in the soil, we really just
don't know when we're going to be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that silica or those trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with products like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a few IPM products that I just
keep in my garden pantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to add those to the
end of this video just because I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but before I do, I forgot about
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to put one, put some in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white flower looking product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually good research that shows
that diatomaceous earth will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: available silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole Goche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nicole Goche did research and showed a
70% reduction in powdery mildew by using
[SPEAKER_00]: diatomaceous earth and will last the
night, I think, as SI sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm doing this off of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will have to check and double check
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is another option for getting
available silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have here, yellow sticky card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys are familiar with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to share, and this
particular one is from Catchmaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked to the owners of the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing about this is sticky cards
have gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This adhesive, while sticky, it doesn't
stay stuck to my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't end up with this glue that I'm
picking at on my fingers for the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this gets in my hair, I can get it out
pretty easily with a little bit of soapy
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some of the brands out there that
use a lower quality adhesive will have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is enough to catch insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what type of adhesive do you want to
use to catch insects without being really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to work with and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cards, as you can see,
they have, let's see if I can show you
[SPEAKER_00]: here, they have perforation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the backside of the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: The front side has the black better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can pull it off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep track of what sort of
insect pressure you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these cards for mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main benefit of these cards is not
mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to keep track of what's in your
garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a fungus net?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a root aphid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a beneficial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just not a pest at all, just
something flying around that happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into my room?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to track these and change
these out regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say how many grows I've gone
into where these things are just covered
[SPEAKER_00]: with fungus nets or they've been up for
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't give us any good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be changing these out
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what these sensor cards are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do need to do mass trapping,
I'm only sharing this because some people
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't aware that this was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy the same material in these
giant rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can string this across your whole
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just are trying to catch a lot
of fungus nets or root aphids or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: flying winged pests that you have that's
hitting your garden, this is what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only telling you so people know
it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would not be my only form of dealing
with an insect infestation, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be used in conjunction with
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, late in flower, you can't spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something like this comes more into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, mass trapping in conjunction
with various sprays is a great way to help
[SPEAKER_00]: control these things or drenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we might use Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might use this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a number of microbial
products that we can apply specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for dealing with certain insect issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to sprays, I want to
show you the two products that I keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I'm the most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is this Monterey
horticultural oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also known as self oil X.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the homeowner size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a giant size for my small
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is more than enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is mineral oil based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people don't want a mineral oil
based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, with this this
product, there's a lot of good research in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of what sort of residual leaves
behind as well as when you know what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is primarily a suffocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to suffocate all the insects
that it comes into contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really good knockdown spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also use it for dipping and a
variety of other things without risking
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for folks who don't want to deal with
a horticultural oil or something that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be derived from mineral oil,
this is a new product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the sample size here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, this sample size is three
point six fluid ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is enough for 30 or 40 gallons of
spray solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, right now, sorry, products called
Epishield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have led with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Bioworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really it's a really cool plant
botanical product that they've that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've they've created and formulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses much lower concentrations than
any other botanical product on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have you have virtually no risk of
phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a ton of research behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I normally don't get behind 25B
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are products that are using
ingredients that are shown to be exempt
[SPEAKER_00]: from the EPA registration list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I don't like these is
because anyone can mix something together
[SPEAKER_00]: and call it an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're using 25B products,
they can register it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there's a ton of research around
Epishield and data to support the efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to have something this size
available to you guys here really soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: because right now the only available sizes
are quite large and much more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: average home grower would ever want or
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff smells amazing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, this is probably my new favorite
go to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the one thing about the Dr. Michael
Brownbridge was actually just telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: SulfoilX or Monterey Horticultural Oil is
actually effective at dealing with the egg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, thrips lay their egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can lay their eggs actually inside
the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will seem to block that little
hole that allows them to breathe before
[SPEAKER_00]: they emerge from the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where something like this would
went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing that same effect with the
Epishield, but Epishield has really good
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy across almost all cannabis pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to the website at Bioworks
and check out the entire label on it
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, really excited about,
and these are the two products that I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to use in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, I think I covered the
majority of organic inputs that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find that are available for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's other ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to ask any questions below in
the comments, and I'm happy to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: answer them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you want to start playing
around and mixing your own soils or
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing organic amendments, this is a
great way to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
See you next time.
