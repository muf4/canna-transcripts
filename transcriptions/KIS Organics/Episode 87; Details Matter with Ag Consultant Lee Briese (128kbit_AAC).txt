[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Lee Brees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee is an independent crop consultant from
central North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: He provides agronomic advice to help
farmers build customized systems to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and manage crops profitably.
[SPEAKER_00]: He specializes in helping farmers adopt
practices to protect and improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and local environment including
reduced till, no till, cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop rotation, and increased plant and
economic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Lee, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can we start off talking a little bit
about your background and sort of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do for a living?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do for a living is I'm an
agricultural crop consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually work directly with farmers to
provide agricultural advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell everybody I'm a plant doctor and I
don't just mean that metaphorically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went to school and have that
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a doctor of plant health from the
University of Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do is I work with farmers and I
go out and check their fields and do
[SPEAKER_01]: regular checkups just like you would think
of it a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very similar to human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're small they need more checkups
and more close attention and as they get
[SPEAKER_01]: older they need a little bit less
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I weekly check the farmers crops and
look for pests and diseases and problems
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental problems and all those
types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do find some things that write
prescriptions whether they be fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions or practice prescriptions or
whatever to help them manage those
[SPEAKER_01]: situations and we maintain it all the way
through the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably seen a lot over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach a given situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any you know critical things
that you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: When stepping onto a new plot of land or
starting to work with a new farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very visual and tactile oriented
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really have to spend some time in
that production system and in that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like to spend a little bit of
alone time and then meet up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer later and talk about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find is that my viewpoint is a
little bit different than the producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I probably see things in a
different light in a different way and I
[SPEAKER_01]: may find some things that are challenging
for them that may they may have just
[SPEAKER_01]: assumed that it just is what it is and
they don't necessarily tackle it or they
[SPEAKER_01]: may value a particular problem more than
another where I may value them
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the combination of the producer and I
working together through these situations
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be very very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I know there are a fair number of
consultants out there that will just look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a soil test or a biological test and
make their recommendations or
[SPEAKER_00]: determinations around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what percentage of would you say
of your decision-making is based off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: test versus what you know what you see in
the field and actually spending that time
[SPEAKER_00]: you know on site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow you ask hard questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so yeah so the test is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an actual measurement that you know
we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me a soil test the ones that I'm
doing primarily are straight-up chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at fertility levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing that the test shows
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important but the type of soil
and the lay of the land the topography of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and all of that influences how
fertility moves and how it's released.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sandy soil versus a higher clay soil or
a steep slope versus a shallow flat field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those all make these differences on how
that nutrient is going to be utilized and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's going to be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those types of things are
critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say about 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a point where I've spent
enough time on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the beginning it's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think once we get into it I mean
there's this continuous note-taking going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I'm out in this field I'm
taking mental notes and I'm taking actual
[SPEAKER_01]: physical notes and writing things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I do this over time my things
change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I adapt them to that specific
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then yes the chemical analysis is still
important but it becomes a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: important over time as we see how the
things fit in that particular field of
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that you primarily use a
chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about biological
analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What experience do you have with that or
what benefit if any do you see associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a question we get a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there's a lot of it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think scientists tend to overdo this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their particular field is the greatest
place to discover new things and I'm no
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a great amount of things
for us to discover in soils that we simply
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think biology is that big reserve of
kind of this cloudy hazy thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of know some of the things that are
going on but we certainly don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that's difficult with
biology is that when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: things we're talking about entire kingdoms
of differences, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about bacteria, we're
talking about archaea, and they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the highest level of organismal
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're talking about huge
differences and when you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria you're talking about things on
hours, minutes, and days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And versus fungi we're talking about days,
weeks, and months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those life cycles affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my caveat with biological analysis is
as much as when you're doing the analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: as what kind of analysis you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I don't have a problem with
analysis because I think they've been well
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's established protocols and all that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take a poor sample or you take
a sample at a timing that's different for
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific biological indicator you're
going to get wildly different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example a cold soil versus a warm
soil or a wet soil versus at the end of a
[SPEAKER_01]: drought you're going to see some very
different things because the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: responds to all of those things versus a
chemical analysis is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward and this is you know it's
going to be a similar thing in both
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's CO2 respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is PFLA's which are actual you know
genetic testing looking for markers and to
[SPEAKER_01]: see who's all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are really interesting
things to pursue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find out who's in there at the time
that you sampled and under those
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that we clearly
understand which ones we want to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: or promote at any given point in time yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really sure what their
involvement is or how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's important who we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if we're going to sort them to
the good guys and bad guys who's on which
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I also hear you saying too is it may
not give you actionable information in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of how you're approaching your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you could say hey this soil should
be more biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know even given the fact that it
hasn't rained recently or we're at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you find that that really changes
the way you manage that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like for me my perspective is like
I'm going to be doing these things to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote good biological activity anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and let's talk about organic
matter next year because I know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: really can go hand in hand in a lot of
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I don't find it it only gives me a
ton of you know actionable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do also feel like when we talk
strictly about sets of organisms like
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal versus bacterial and what the
ratios may be it's it's too macroscopic of
[SPEAKER_00]: a view to really to really know what goes
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need our level of knowledge to
increase to where we can really start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these species and how they
interact with particular crops and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's such a complex system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost feels like an oversimplification
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what are your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is an oversimplification and I
think it's it is this complex wild jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a point in time when
we're trying to cultivate the antelope and
[SPEAKER_01]: the lions are just gobbling them up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's fine if that's what your
goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things aren't necessarily actionable
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's not worthwhile to try
to catalog some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing some type of regular analysis
potentially yearly analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again I would do it under similar
conditions and similar timeframes both
[SPEAKER_01]: spatially temporally and within your
production system so that it's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: repeated repetitive things you're trying
to measure the same point in time the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can maybe track some changes
potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again what what you're going to do
about that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the things that you're
going to do you're going to do anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said you're trying to you're
trying to manage your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to manage your cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to manage your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to manage your nutrient
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pH is and all these changes things to
make sure that your crop has the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think really the best biological
indicators for us as people are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that are easiest to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your crop is one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a healthy well producing
crop I think it tells you a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure that we need to know all
of those details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that little black box can stay
black.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a healthy crop I mean that's
our ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not measure that rather than all of
these secondary indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so I've stolen these and I can't even
give credit because it was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so organic matter is composed of three
types of basic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be the living sort of live
organisms and stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's the recently dead the things
that you can easily identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's a plant or a piece of a
leaf or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the really dead they call
it which is the dark colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no longer distinguishable but we
know it's not a mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it came from organic and it's
not a it's not a mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three kind of pools of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all part of the deal and a
lot of people call the long term stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: humus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is that after we talked
I looked into this more and there's been
[SPEAKER_01]: some new science on humus and the idea of
long term stable organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may not be as long term as we
originally thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come up with new tools and tactics
to measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're measuring it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prior to this we've used a very harsh
chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what came out of that at the end
was these very stable compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: these organic matter compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use a really really strong acid
to dissolve things you change it
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it recombines it combines into
some very strong structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gone to using some microscopic
type of things as technologies improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see that they think that this
longer term organic matter that the really
[SPEAKER_01]: dead stuff that we can't identify what it
is may actually benefit from.
Which is why I say that we don't have to
take a hobby of testing.
Why not take a hobby of testing.
Because it's a very simple solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's actually created a cycle
quite a bit faster than we thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again I don't know that it matters a
whole lot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so when I'm assessing soil I like to I
like to take a shovel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to dig a little hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for structure or the permeability,
the ability of water to move through it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability of roots to move through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I love to smell that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get that earthy smell and see
what that smells like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells good to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if that isn't an evolutionary
thing for human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to smell good earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand what that means that those
that didn't maybe didn't do so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think part of that is this idea
of this whole using your senses to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that qualitative assessment
can sometimes be really, really important
[SPEAKER_01]: and in certain situations as important or
more important than a quantitative
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment because quantitative only
measures one thing at a time versus when
[SPEAKER_01]: you or I are out there with a shovel and a
handful of soil we're measuring and
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating several things at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're almost like a detective using
those qualitative tools and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative tools to figure out whatever
that limiting factor of growth is in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to plant health or maybe the
farmers priorities, those sorts of things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean it to be all fairy tales
and rainbows type of thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, when I'm talking about we
can measure soil density and that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and bulk density of the soil,
it can be measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tells us about pore space and
water permeability and all those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take a shovel and you can put
it into the soil and you can feel the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between a compacted soil that
has very little pore space, it's hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been driven on your driveway versus a
really well grown prairie native land or
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that feeling and we can feel that
as much with a shovel and do that
[SPEAKER_01]: qualitatively and understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something and it's actually
much more rapid than trying to take an
[SPEAKER_01]: analytical test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I use the analytical test to back up
these qualitative measurements because I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to calibrate it some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm in a good mood, I tend to measure
things a little more optimistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm having a rough day, it may not be
quite so optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to make sure that I calibrate it
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really the combination of the
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's fitting these pieces
together in a specific set to make it fit
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular piece of land,
that particular farm, that particular goal
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for people who are unfamiliar
with determining soil texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the ISSA meeting a couple of
years back and they had a booth there
[SPEAKER_00]: where people could do essentially the soil
ribbon test to determine the fractions of
[SPEAKER_00]: sand, silt, and clay in a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are quite accurate at
doing this, very close to what a full
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis would tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is qualitative, I will say I'm
not very good at it myself, but it was fun
[SPEAKER_00]: to see people that were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is a practice in time
thing and an experience thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think once you, so you got to
start somewhere, you got to start at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so going to a booth where they have,
okay, this is a high clay soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a high silt soil, this is a high
sand soil, gets you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you practice with it,
and then again, you double check with the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do that ribbon analysis everywhere I
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily like write the numbers
down 30% clay and 20% silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that type of thing, but I'm always
have it in my hand when I've taken the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil up, I dig it up, I've got it in my
hand, I'll perform the ribbon analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I'll look at that is
very difficult to measure in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do it, is the soil aggregates,
those little chunks, those little nubbins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll hear people talk about soil
should look like chocolate cake or should
[SPEAKER_01]: have little Lego blocks in them rather
than just be this massive fluff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd rather not have it as flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all of those little aggregates
are, they're individual cities and
[SPEAKER_01]: universes for all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about the scale of
bacteria, they need small places with
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopic organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within one of these little aggregates,
there's all kinds of different places for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think about it as a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a downtown where things are
very dense and congested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's kind of that outskirts or
the area, the suburban area around the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get into the more rural area
on the outside of this aggregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be quite honest, with either
different biological things that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: live in all of those different spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with oxygen contents and
water contents and nutrient availability
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those aggregates provide several little
cities with many, many, many environments
[SPEAKER_01]: for different types of biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus a fluffy soil that's more like
flour is a different type of landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: that's much more uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be easier for us to manage
physically with planting equipment or
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting equipment and that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not near as biologically active
as those little aggregates with cities
[SPEAKER_01]: that have all these different environments
for those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at it as a microbe,
if you're a bacteria trying to move a
[SPEAKER_01]: million meters in a possibility,
it's like me trying to walk to across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country from California to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just simply can't do it in a reasonable
timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things that are easy to see
and assess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put them in your fingers and
you start to crush them.
[SPEAKER_01]: How strong are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: How stable are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can measure all of this in a lab,
but you have to be careful in how you take
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send it to the lab and then they do a
water shake test and it takes some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll give you the aggregate size
fractions, large ones, medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: small, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can do this right in the field with
a shovel with a little bit of practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've determined texture, then we can
determine aggregate stability,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that leads into water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also determined both density and
all we needed with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at, in this case,
the physical properties of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then from there you would turn to the
sort of the chemical properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where that lab test comes in
handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm making assumptions for the
biology based on the physical,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that this aggregate's kind of the
build it and they will come thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you give them the environment,
the biology can prosper in a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not necessarily advocating no-till for
everything, but tillage isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: a tool for us to manage our crops and to
do things in the right ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's possible, where you can reduce
that and maintain stable aggregates,
[SPEAKER_01]: it helps with your biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things that helps with the
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Significant tillage again and again and
again is challenging for biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where you'll see some of those
ratios change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what people try to use
them for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, if your bacterial ratio
is getting really high, those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, again, the short life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rebound much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can rebound in a few days versus a
fungi that you've taken and some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: micellar inches long and you grind them up
into these little stubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to take them a lot longer
to regenerate and regrow and their life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle's longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that if you do a PFLA,
you'll see your bacterial analysis will be
[SPEAKER_01]: much higher than your fungal analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be related to just you had to
do tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does that mean you did the wrong
thing for your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have needed to do that for your
production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you measured it at that time,
you may see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again, that temporal thing,
when you're measuring what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these things that most,
I can't see the bacteria, but I can smell
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that good earth smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actinomycetes bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actinomycetes are their own little group
and those are breaking down organic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and they're releasing specific
aromatic compounds that we can smell and
[SPEAKER_01]: we smell it as good earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just means that your biological
system is basically functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in some soils that have a high
salt content just naturally and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: very little if no smell to them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really because the salts are
preventing that biology from being highly
[SPEAKER_01]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you mentioned high salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, one of the things about dealing
with outdoor crops is you kind of are
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck with the conditions that you're
stuck with, whether that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen high calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen high salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're testing, you're doing a
chemical analysis, not just on the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the water as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, no, this is undried soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can definitely do a chemical
analysis on water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that we do routinely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways that we measure salt or
saline soils here is actual electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can do that in situ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't even sent to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a machine that injects,
it puts out an electrical current and so
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical current and then it receives
how much comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually looking at conductance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the inverse of resistance basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going on is as long as we have a
little bit of water for the wire or the
[SPEAKER_01]: conduit, that will conduct electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more solutes you have,
the more salts you have, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity gets constructed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have a higher reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how salts are typically
measured is through electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be done in the lab or in situ in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can measure those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the salts, what they do is they
really, it's pretty straightforward in
[SPEAKER_01]: most cases, is it's just an osmotic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high salts and the plants can't get
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts like a drought as the salt pulls
harder than the plant can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it can't get moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few situations where a
specific ion will interfere with other
[SPEAKER_01]: ions and cause some issues or really high
concentrations of chloride per se can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to become plant toxic that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's typically a drought inducing
situation for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we use soluble salts or EC to
measure on the saturated paste to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: see what level of fertility we're starting
at in indoor with essentially potting
[SPEAKER_00]: soils or soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very different situation
because typically we can keep our sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: content substantially lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at what fraction of that
is actually sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also realizing that this tells
us sort of our fertility in some way.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does because it's related to your
cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It relates directly because those charges
help conduct that electricity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some examples of when you feel
like tillage is important in a production
[SPEAKER_00]: system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, one of the main things tends to
be a disease management type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I'm a fan of residue cover in
production agricultural fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like wind erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like water erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant material, the biomass from
the previous crop is a really good way to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect that soil or armor it from heavy
rainfall or high wind events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also the perfect place for the
fungi and bacteria and those
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms to survive and proliferate
and be ready for next year's crop and to
[SPEAKER_01]: attack you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are times when we need to manage
the residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how aggressive you get is there are
grades, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to go all the way from
complete annihilation of all soil
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and all plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are grades across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is individual specific
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the following crop going to be SSF
susceptible to the potential diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you use that as one of your tools,
using a crop that's not as susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: that disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you don't have to worry so much
about that breakdown component,
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other time where in production,
in particular, where we're using tillage
[SPEAKER_01]: as a tool is when we've had to do field
operations when we shouldn't be there,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's too wet often.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have too much moisture, but the crop is
in jeopardy of being lost to the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we simply have to physically go out
there and get it, and we'll leave tracks
[SPEAKER_01]: and ruts and be in the field and some
compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've moved soil and you've made
impressions with heavy equipment out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, it's not going to just magically
disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to move the soil to fill that in
and to make another level playing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're using it targeted that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we've made a management decision that
we need to go do something and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: caused a problem, then we're using it as
partial fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's typically what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tillage is used much more broadly in my
region, and it's used to manage water
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fall moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys are doing tillage this fall here
now, getting ready to reduce the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: so that next year it's drier to plant into
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can plant easier in a good condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increasing your infiltration rate,
using some cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, they have their own drawbacks
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what I'm hearing is that
none of these things are black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage isn't always bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at each situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each field has its own light, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've led me right into my tagline.
[SPEAKER_01]: My details matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling you, I have a sticker with
my ugly face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on it that says details matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really the important
part of this whole thing is that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get really good advice from someone who
has a little bit different production
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tell you exactly how everything's
working and works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go home and you try to do it
and you have a different system or you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a different challenge or your
problems are not that type of priority or
[SPEAKER_01]: your logistics don't work out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really fitting those things and
getting that information is critically
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really valuable to get information
from other people, from other sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: from good science-based sources,
locally and get great distances so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can try new ideas and try new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also critically important to
apply that directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the dieting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to lose some weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm overweight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certain foods that I just
don't like and I won't eat and that type
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to fit this into my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we talk about, OK, we'd love to
exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exercise is a great part of personal
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are you going to run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to walk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to swim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to bike?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it fit into your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: What time frame do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you go for an hour and a half on a
long walk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have 20 minutes and you need a
treadmill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the specifics to each individual
situation, whether it's the farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmer or the acre or that little
small plot of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the specifics that everything
has to be applied to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I go for walks because I have
the time and I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to do that at work rather than
driving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just go walk across the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting more steps in and I'm still
doing two things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you asked me to swim, I would drown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's never going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no wonder swimming is a great way to
burn a lot of calories in a short period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, but I don't swim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very poor fit for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's along these same lines is like you
could have really, really good ideas from
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they fit into your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they fit into the hard rules that you
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next question is,
can you change some of those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should learn to swim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a bigger step.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to change your whole
logistics and your whole production system
[SPEAKER_01]: for a particular practice, because it
sounds really good, I would caution people
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you and I talked about using
science, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may see research that shows
something to be really promising in a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: or in a trial field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't necessarily take that
information and apply it across our own
[SPEAKER_00]: farm or our own given situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what you're saying is there's a
little more due diligence we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: before committing to a new idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, science is a system of
probability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the thing that I mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have this idea that,
well, science says this, it means exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we actually use statistics,
and it's all about probability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times it's like, well,
you've got a 95% chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the outcome you're going to get if
you do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not only if you just do these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do these things with these
certain situations in a certain area,
[SPEAKER_01]: so science tends to be done in a very
specific way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's doing is taking a lot of
variables away so that when they change
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing, they're trying to make sure
that's the only thing that changes so that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the actual change they measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in a production system, we can't
manage all of those things to that level
[SPEAKER_01]: where this is the only thing that is
actually changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes when you do add a new
practice, you've had to change several
[SPEAKER_01]: other things to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were going to do less tillage,
well, you've done less tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also changed your water
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed your nutrient profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed your oxygenation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed your aggregates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed a lot of things that you
didn't intend it to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though a producer did one
different practice, it actually could
[SPEAKER_01]: change multiple things that are hard to
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think people need to understand that
science is a very good starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather have that than rumors,
your wive tales, or somebody exaggerating
[SPEAKER_01]: how great their stories are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those are all dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need the science to back that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an applied scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go and get the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try to fit it to those
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are times when really promising
science doesn't fit in a particular area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had mentioned earlier, we were talking
about cover crops before we started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about how they can be a
really, really good tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live in a very arid place where
water is your absolute most limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factor, a cover crop could be a very poor
decision for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to take your most
valuable resource and use it for something
[SPEAKER_01]: other than crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that alone might be enough to say this
is not a good practice for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that cover crops are a bad
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just may not fit in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you go about your cover crop
selection or determination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my area makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we start off with,
though, is what are we trying to fix?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we trying to manage?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we trying to do something with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have probably three or four main
goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is erosion protection,
to help me from wind and water erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is to actually manage excess
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have too much moisture for the
next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third one will have poor
producing soils or those saline soils
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do something different
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, once you've figured out
what your goal is, what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to do, it's much easier to help you
select a crop because then you can figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out which ones are going to do what you
want them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the moisture usage, like if we have
excess moisture, I try to use a crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be there more often when I
can't grow anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll use a winter cereal, like cereal
rye up here, that we'll plant in the fall
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll grow in the fall, use some moisture
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll overwinter in our harsh winters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be growing next spring early on
when we have snow melt and heavy rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll help us manage that excess
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can use tillage or herbicides to
terminate it and plant our regular crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're trying to do something
different, it may not be the right fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are times when cereal rye is a
bad fit simply because the following crop
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be affected by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like to see producers plant
corn after cereal rye because the cereal
[SPEAKER_01]: rye is very competitive and very
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can actually hurt their corn yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're going to plant soybean,
it's absolutely a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is those details matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you actually going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you've set a goal, like I want to
manage moisture, I want to reduce excess
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, then it's much easier for you to
measure that, both empirically and
[SPEAKER_01]: observationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to plant cover crops for
healthier soil, well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to measure in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit outside of your area
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get a lot of people running cover
crops indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about the reasons why we
use cover crops that you listed there,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those don't really apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the same water challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have wind erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while cover crops are wonderful,
this is sort of where you get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not so black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we talk about fertility,
well, now we just added a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: variable that's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot harder to measure versus being
able to add a specific fertilizer to get
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever macro or micronutrient we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're trying to gauge the breakdown of
this organic matter, this cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have competition for nutrient now with
our actual crop because people want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: them not as a separate crop, but as a
polycropping, essentially, companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have disease and habitat
concerns for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a little bit of a nightmare on
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works fine in a small tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some people that are doing
it on scale, but it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like as a gardener or a farmer,
what we can do to reduce labor and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: variability makes it easier for us to make
decisions on our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're applying 50 different things and
spraying all these different things like
[SPEAKER_00]: we see some guys do, it's hard to know
what's good, what's bad, what's innocuous
[SPEAKER_00]: in the system like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come onto the scene and they
tell me, well, I did this, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many, there's too many ifs
there that I couldn't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think really this is, you know,
when you're, when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this is risk management, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to manage your risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end, we want these people
to all be effective and economically
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want every business to survive and
thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really that's about risk management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the situation you described where
you actually have control over erosion,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have control over the water,
you have control over the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things I don't have
control over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm using the cover crops to help
manage that risk for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're taking those really right off
your risk plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you add all of those alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, all of these, these
additional crops have their own biological
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits, but they also have their own
distractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the idea of when there's a lot of
anything, there's going to be whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: eats it is going to be proliferating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So disease can be a significant issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, a lot of our fungal
disease in particular, are very good at
[SPEAKER_01]: adapting to several hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very concerned about that,
too, for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So white mold is one of the problems that
we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine some of your producers
have white mold challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a very wide host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of different plants can
proliferate that and increase that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that's very,
very difficult to manage once you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: high inoculum population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that essentially the same thing as
powdery mildew, or are you referring to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different white mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm referring to sclerotinia, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So white mold powdery mildew does also
have a fairly wide host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it likes those high humidity
situations that you're having.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you could definitely increase the
inoculum in there and make that much worse
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the things we do in
agriculture, is we actually break natural
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles in order to produce a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically for our needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is I want to jump into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Egg is not nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even gardening is not nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to produce certain things
that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the exclusion of other things you
don't want, this is the whole idea that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can argue that an invasive species is
always a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of times when native
species are considered a weed because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're less desirable, or they're hurting
your crop, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not trying to replicate nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature produces whatever it can with the
resources it has, and it doesn't produce
[SPEAKER_01]: for any one particular species in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, to any plant, an insect is a
predator typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A caterpillar is always a bad thing to
plants because that's who eats you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about your perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: This again goes to if you're watching the
nature show, or you're cheering for the
[SPEAKER_01]: antelope, or you're cheering for the lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're both biological organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just depends on your perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: In agriculture, we're trying to produce
things for one species, for humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a very narrow subset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to stack the deck in our
hearts to produce as much as we can for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really a sustainability goal
because now we need less acreage and less
[SPEAKER_01]: resources in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're really efficient at producing
what we want for our species, then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using less in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus if we were all trying to forage out
of nature, well, then we'd have to compete
[SPEAKER_01]: with everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this goes back into those ideas
of I think it's wise to control these
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios and to keep your risk low and
not add a bunch of variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're producing a bunch of other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using fertilizer and water and
organic matter resources to breed disease
[SPEAKER_01]: because you grew a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that's a wise choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone who's passionate about
organics and sustainability, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be cognizant of where we're
sourcing our materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are going to use fertilizer,
how do we do it in a way that has less of
[SPEAKER_00]: an impact on our local and world ecology?
[SPEAKER_00]: What industries are we supporting with
where we're sourcing these micro and macro
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, adding a cover crop
or adding a second crop doesn't get us
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere close to the diversity and
complexity that we would have in a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still essentially monocropping when
we look at just how vast of a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in diversity there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think monocropping gets a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that it should get as bad
a rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if it's efficient and it's
producing what we need it to at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: timing, then I don't know that it's
necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just kind of cast as all
evil monocropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not a huge fan of growing the
same crop forever in the same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges there is that you're
breeding your diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pest problems are depleting your
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the same crop,
it wants the same demands again and again
[SPEAKER_01]: and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't necessarily... I'm not
convinced monocropping is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets this really bad rap that gets just
this terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's highly efficient and highly
effective, then maybe it's the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of negative press about
livestock production.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are saying, well, why don't we just
use land that we're using for livestock
[SPEAKER_01]: for crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's less footprint there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this land is not necessarily
suitable for crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons it's in
livestock production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't farm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either too hilly, too rocky,
too sandy, too light, all of those types
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a perennial plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the way that we're gaining
human benefit from most perennial plants
[SPEAKER_01]: is through animal protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And livestock has the ability to improve
land as much as it has to destroy land,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, if it's managed correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it's managed, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are some of your organic
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using livestock manures as
part of your fertility, but then again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we're talking about lettuce
production or we're talking about fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: market types of things, there are little
tag along biologicals that we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salmonella and clostridium and all of that
type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you use another biological
process, composting, to reset that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've changed what type of biology is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have biology that's less
threatening to human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it comes back to
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, your management has to set
goals, clear goals that make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you trying to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to get to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are you trying to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can assess your system and
see what are your challenges, your
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, your bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can start to devise some
systems that target those and then move
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's everything from gardening a
plant in your house to thousands of acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your limitations?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your plans and strategies to
manage them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, what I hear a lot of is just
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: People approach this like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I don't care about the
methodology, the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, a lot of people are talking
about indoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to know that they're going
to get a yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can get a price per pound
for that yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that feels short-sighted to me
in some ways, because I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: create systems that are more sustainable
and allow for lower cost of production
[SPEAKER_00]: over time with our media choices and our
production choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, what do you do
when a farmer just wants to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, to me, I hear you on the yield
conversation, but I think we need to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about economic yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's more profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're producing a huge yield,
but it's cost you a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce it and your profit's small,
that's still really difficult to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can maximize your profit through
some simple situations, then that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: where you try to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my farmers talk exactly the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way as yours do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to talk yield, yield,
yield, yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hard part is it's much easier to
compare yield between your neighbor and
[SPEAKER_01]: your friend and the next guy and the
competitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one number.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get their actual economics,
some of these productions, whether they're
[SPEAKER_01]: a big ag or a small ag, they don't know
their cost of production as well as they
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're not going to share that
open either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's hard to compare profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are significant gains when
you change some systems and you reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: some expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can maintain or get very close to the
premium yield that you had, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing these really expensive
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it in production ag really
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more due to tillage and the cost
of big tractors and equipment and tillage
[SPEAKER_01]: and fuel and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if we can reduce our tillage,
we save all of the expenses and we get
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is we have to factor
in our expenses and you may not know their
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of labor, you may not know their cost
of equipment or infrastructure to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: larger yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can produce a lower amount with
less cost of production, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be coming out ahead at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that detail in every
business matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you really need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want people to do their profit
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a detail that matters to their
business and not necessarily to their
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor's business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's probably the most important
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see where people get caught up in that
sort of game of who can produce the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, that's not
necessarily the important variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the coffee shop bragging,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to have the best yield,
you'd be the last guy to tell them what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because who's actually checking those
numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all susceptible to try to being
better than your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're the last person to announce
their yield, you might just edge it up a
[SPEAKER_01]: hair just to make sure you had a little
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and in my industry, what's
really important, too, is crop quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the quality of that crop
really in terms of value and how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: market and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that is
important when we talk about a production
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's move on from that topic and
talk a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just jump back to soil testing
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at a chemical analysis of a
soil, what are some particular levers or
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers that you look at that really stand
out when you start to first begin
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting the fertility in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my area, pH is a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think any area pH is going to be
something you really want to have a handle
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it affects the availability of all
your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it affects your crop growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a critical one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at soluble salts more because we
have excess soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's indicative of some of the
challenges we may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I focus on the macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
sulfur, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know zinc is considered a
micronutrient, but it's on the higher end
[SPEAKER_01]: of those levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to be one of those that's
more challenging for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is related to our pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my neighborhood, a lot of our pHs are
on the higher side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at least 7, 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we get into 7, 8,
and even 8 pHs in some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that affects our zinc dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pay attention to those and those
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pause you for one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to ask you a real
point-blank question regarding pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I want to talk a little bit about
how you lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I get a lot of guys in
organics in the cannabis industry that say
[SPEAKER_00]: pH doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can throw out my pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in organics, do you feel like pH
plays a role in optimizing production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pH is the overriding factor of
nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a fairly wide set where pH is
optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be anywhere from about 5,
8 to 6, 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: 6, 4 is really where your pH is where
you'd want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were going to choose it,
that's where you'd want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that 6, 2 range would be the perfect
pH for nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start getting down into the low
5s, you have aluminum toxicities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have other issues with
inavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: High in pH, you have calcium tying up
phosphorus, zinc, and a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have high pH and you're tying
up all the nutrients, you can apply more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they get tied up and they're not
available readily unless you're using a
[SPEAKER_01]: chelating agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably the better way to
manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I find with organics is pH still
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just find that a lot of the practices
people are using in organics may lead them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a pH that falls within a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, essentially, there's more
buffering capacity with- When you have
[SPEAKER_01]: high organic soil- High organic matter,
things like that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have high organic matter soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in that sweet spot of pH,
and you're going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see where that's going to be
less of a concern than it would be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in organic soil, it's going to
be less of a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm talking about artificial
soilless media here, potting soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find, for me, 6.6 to 6.8 is my sweet
spot where the soils want to settle
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a lot of the alkaline inputs
we're using, specifically adding biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the high amounts of calcium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have trouble keeping calcium and some of
the cations up when we start dropping pH
[SPEAKER_00]: below 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they're going to get
associated with all kinds of other things
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and calcium is one of the ways to
kind of jack your pH a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it carbonates to bring that up,
some lining and that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, retarded soilless media,
it's a very different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit outside of my
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do realize they're very different
creatures, and a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to look at the soil test
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some numbers we just have to throw
out on a soil test because they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: not calibrated for soilless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you deal with lowering pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a greenhouse situation where the
gentleman had quite a high pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: close to 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at ways to rapidly lower
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw mixed results with people with
adding peat moss in terms of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: research shows, whether or not that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is not on the scale that
you're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know these aren't things that you
would normally deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or agricultural sulfur, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What approaches do you take to lower pH,
adding things to the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that might be your best bet in that
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about elemental sulfur
is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that's going to be of an
acidified nature, it's going to grab on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And leave hydrogen ions behind is going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen, ammoniated nitrogen,
can actually reduce pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about the scale here is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you lower your pH much,
you tend to have toxic levels of sulfur,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, or whatever, because it takes so
much of that to move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pH is one of those things that you may
not be paying a lot of attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the buffer pH may be critically
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really how much abuse your soil
can take before the pH is going to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a widespread in your buffer
pH, you're not going to be able to move it
[SPEAKER_01]: very far with any inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, those inputs are going
to get to the point where they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be tying up other nutrients, or causing
plant toxicity, or emergence issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: or root growth issues, because it takes so
much of that thing to chemically change
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the ability, you might be
better off changing your media to
[SPEAKER_01]: something a little bit different,
or adding some other type of media base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's more vermiculite, or some other
type of bentonite, or some other type of
[SPEAKER_01]: clay to help trap some of those ions,
and to change your pH a little bit that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the solution is probably the easiest
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I haven't seen sulfur toxicity with
cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing excessive sulfur really
being an issue with other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not adding high concentrations
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cycle for us would be two to three
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're adding a little bit,
and slowly over time, lowering the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're doing it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about in our agricultural
soil, so we have a lot of high pH soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some stuff that gets up at an 8.5,
8.8 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done research on it for here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about per acre,
on the order of elemental sulfur now,
[SPEAKER_01]: five tons per acre, which is just this
ridiculous amount of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can move the pH a little bit,
but the buffer pH kicks back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in a few years, it kind of bounces
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's become not only economically
unviable, but that level of sulfur is just
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive to the point that it retards
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing it with your solution
over time, with your nutrient balances,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe you're giving it just a little
extra kick once in a while to try to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, then I think you're being very
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, again, a little bit aside my
parameters, is that saturated calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions can help change some things
sometimes, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just the high leaching, like leaching
your soils may move something for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I shouldn't even say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've used leaching for nitrates,
potassium, sodium, some of those more
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile nutrients in soils, and had good
success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our guys will even just reset
their beds by leaching through them a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that allows them to put the same
nutrient load back into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of giving you a reset close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's worked well for some growers
that I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do if you're in actual
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pH of, let's say, 7.5 or
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you begin to manage a crop on land
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have gone to the point of
we're using some chelator nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most problematic situation when we
have high pH is we're going to have iron
[SPEAKER_01]: availability issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and our soils are made out of iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the main constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a high pH, this causes
it in availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: The iron becomes unavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most susceptible crops we
will grow is soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see iron chlorotic soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called iron deficiency chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's related to the high pH of that
soil and also the water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the answer there is if you
have significant iron problems in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soybean, you can try a chelated nutrient,
which is
[SPEAKER_01]: a chelate that fills all three sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an organic chelate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, it makes it more available
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a significant issue,
the answer is don't grow soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is literally the right answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where you
reach a point where, OK, we can change
[SPEAKER_01]: some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of things that simply
are not worth the expense to try to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these chelated nutrients are
extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need them at a really high rate at
those high pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're not long-term stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like we can build it up over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for that season or even part of
that season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really isn't cost-effective to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer is to grow a more tolerant
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you said you're not really
measuring water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you find water?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, like in our area here, we'll find in
some cases to be pretty alkaline water or
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers in Oklahoma, they have some
really bad water, sodium or calcium or
[SPEAKER_00]: even iron in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that it doesn't really factor
in on the scale you're at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no control over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't filter it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't filter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't use irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all natural rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that it's unimportant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply have no control over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that might be the same thing as
your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do anything about it or it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, I literally can't affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two fields that have irrigation
pivots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can only manage them a certain way
because they're on off-peak electric and
[SPEAKER_01]: they tell us when we can turn them on and
when we can't turn them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we run them as much as we can when
we need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only thing we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, the water quality in North
Dakota is decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to have high calcium and high
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, we have higher pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fairly young soils that have a lot
of those nutrients in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be our water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our water quality is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of our water is very potable,
easily drinkable water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's good for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not carrying a bunch of dangerous
things like what you're talking about with
[SPEAKER_01]: an Oklahoma leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there could be lots of things in the
water that could be problematic for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also mentioned aluminum as you get
to a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing on heavy metals in some of
these states for cannabis is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eliminating heavy metal
availability or filtering it out of any
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, whether it's water or fertilizer,
is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to get into zinc because that's
something that I haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know very little about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done much research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to hear why you mention it
as a macronutrient and the importance of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zinc in a lot of plants is related to
the reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used as a co-enzyme in a lot of
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's critically important for
reproduction, flower set, flower
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility, and pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily used at a high
level, but it's super important for those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see it in several crops in North
Dakota, where zinc deficiency is a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant yield problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn would be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry edible bean or pinto bean would be
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pintos would be another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then alfalfa is the third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all respond really well to small
levels of zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the way that zinc is,
it combines with several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has several sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our typical way of placing zinc is
actually with a phosphorus fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And zinc loves to attach to phosphates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we use that chelated zinc,
which is protecting it from that
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can use a lower rate, and we'll
put that right in fertile right next to
[SPEAKER_01]: the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that young seed gets into this zinc
early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that zinc will help with
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why you'll see white or yellow
coloring if you have a zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a co-enzyme for photosynthesis,
but it's also a co-enzyme for all
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're growing seed or you're
growing flower parts or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: zinc can be critically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high pH will be very, very problematic
for zinc abilitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give me a specific product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you say zinc, I immediately
think of zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other ways or other products
that are chelated forms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a liquid chelated zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 9% zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of specifically what
it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used bio-min zinc that's an organic
approved chelate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio-min, they do a...
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a product like that,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's ones out there,
but that doesn't get ineffective
[SPEAKER_01]: price-wise using... It would for you,
yes, because your zinc sulfate's highly
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're using it in a drench or a
liquid irrigation, chemigation or
[SPEAKER_01]: fertigation type of thing, you're way
better off using zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting it with the fertilizer,
so the zinc sulfate's coming as a granular
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fertilizers that we're using are
liquid fertilizers, but they're oil-based
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the zinc goes in with liquids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting a quart of zinc per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very low rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why we put it with a
phosphorus, because the phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out at five gallons, and that's
actually a consistent stream in the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you try to put a quart per
acre, you have a dot here and a dot there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 20 feet further, you have another dot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not really good for the ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why we're putting it into a
starter right near the seed bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're putting it with a higher volume
thing, so that we get it spread out,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that every seed gets a chance at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it doesn't take a whole lot,
but it needs to be highly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this chelation process is expensive,
but it helps maintain it, because
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus will grab onto zinc in a split
second and tie it up, and it becomes rock,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it won't dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also protects our zinc from our
high pH chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're isolating it in a band,
and we're keeping it away from a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do use zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll broadcast that on land, and we'll do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a once every three or four years
deal, because we use a high rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will last for three,
four, five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the consistency of the product,
it's a granule, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a pelletized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most egg fertilizers that I'm dealing with
are pelletized, so they're several orders
[SPEAKER_01]: larger than the granular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just becomes a logistics issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using this very fine granule,
it's harder to spread it over wider
[SPEAKER_01]: distances, because these spreaders are
trying to cover 40 feet for the spinner
[SPEAKER_01]: spreader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a small particle just doesn't fly that
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're saying granular,
you're describing almost like a powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: just for listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit above a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I'm talking about
pelletized, I'm talking about something
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of a baby or bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pellets are larger and have more
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll fly further.
[SPEAKER_01]: The granule would be one tenth the size of
a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a powder is going to be very
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your zinc sulfate you're getting is
going to be a powder, because it dissolves
[SPEAKER_01]: easily in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a liquid base of zinc
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a chelation agent in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, the zinc is dissolved in
the liquid with a chelating agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, I just looked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry from zinc chloride and zinc
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're adding a humic component to
chelate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, we're adding a little
bit of CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually when you said
chelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain went to humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, oh, do I have time to
ask you one last question about your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts about humic acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's kind of a contentious topic,
I feel like, in the ag world a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the humic acids are part of the CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a really, really low CEC,
you could have amazing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a moderate to high CEC,
you're going to see nothing, because its
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of change is not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking quarts or gallons per
acre even, I mean, one inch of rainfall is
[SPEAKER_01]: 27,000 gallons of water per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start talking about five
gallons an acre even, you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: micro percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a highly sandy soil or
something with a very low nutrient holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity, and you add a little bit of a
chelating agent, which is a humic
[SPEAKER_01]: component, you're going to see that your
nutrient availability jumps drastically in
[SPEAKER_01]: proportion to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, we have very good clay soils,
a lot of silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a high CEC normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have decent organic matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2% to 4% for us is pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have pretty good CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we add a little bit of humic
components, it moved the needle 0.5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not going to notice that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to a sand soil in some of the
coastal areas, if you go to Florida or
[SPEAKER_01]: California or something like that,
there's almost pure sand, and they add a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of humic, it has 10 times as
much nutrient holding capacity as the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you see this huge benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where the details matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What problem are you trying to solve?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the right solution for your problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting, because with potting
soils, we have a fairly low really high
[SPEAKER_00]: CEC, very high organic matter percentage
off the charts compared to what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten the same results from
humic acids that I would have expected or
[SPEAKER_00]: would have liked to see in some of those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like taking aspirin when you don't
have a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you have a heart condition,
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't need it, you don't need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the details part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing on that, so you can have
all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have very high organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have very high CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have very high nutrient holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're flushing a lot of water
through this, then you might see a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference if you added the humic
component to your solution, simply because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to hold the nutrients in the
water better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be some of the variable
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: This again goes back to the different
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somebody's flushing a ton of water
through something for some other reason to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to make manage a pH, and they add a
little bit of humic component,
[SPEAKER_01]: they see a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next guy is not flushing near as
much water, and he adds the humic
[SPEAKER_01]: component, he sees nothing, or he sees a
negative response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just simply you didn't need the
aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you probably experienced this in
the ag industry, but this idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always another product out there
or another thing that's going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing difference in my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't necessarily look at nitrogen
as nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at this brand or that brand or
this potential form of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes we move a little too
far away from just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just so many marketing claims
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, the canvas industry is even
worse than the ag industry in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes very hard to evaluate a product
and know what it's going to work in your
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which gets back to your whole
science thing and how it's so important
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use experimental design in our own
field or our own room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have replication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have checks and balances on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The non-treated check is critically
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things is just think about
plants again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get all of these wonderful
plants, these amazing, I call them the
[SPEAKER_01]: snake oils, all these things that are just
going to save and fix everything and do
[SPEAKER_01]: all these wonderful things, there's a
potential possibly in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want people to think about what a
plant needs and what a plant does,
[SPEAKER_01]: what a plant uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, there was a big push for a while
about using sugars in plant production,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding sugar as a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just absolutely counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole process of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to take carbon dioxide and water
and to make sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what a plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its byproduct, the sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding sugar to a plant doesn't make
any sense because it's what a plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about nutrients in
particular, we talk about nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that plants only assume a couple
of forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically elemental forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nitrate and they're ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what plants assume is ammonia
and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they bring up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as your fertilizer turns into
that, it's plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it came out of the back
end of a sheep or it came out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: paperbosh process or it came out of
nitrogen fixation through bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's in that form, the plant's
happy because the plant takes these
[SPEAKER_01]: elemental forms and builds the things that
other organisms like us need from eating
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the proteins and we need the
sugars and the carbohydrates and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of stuff because we can't build them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants literally build them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all we got to do is give them the Lego
blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, as long as it's a four by
four Lego block, it doesn't matter if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow or blue or green or red,
the plant doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll use it to build what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my short answer to all of these
wonderful claims about this is ortho this
[SPEAKER_01]: and poly that and it comes from such and
such whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it turns into the plant ions
that they need, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phosphorus is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's H2PO4 and it's HPO4.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two forms that plants absorb
phosphorus to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only things they absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all it needs to turn into.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it does that, we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real quickly, you mentioned sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could the counter argument be that sugars
would raise the bacterial levels or
[SPEAKER_00]: biological levels in the soil,
which may increase nutrient cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be the theory behind it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll increase the biology, but it doesn't
necessarily increase the nitrogen fixing
[SPEAKER_01]: biology because that's not the food that
sources that they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrobactors tend to use carbon
sources and sulfate sources to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen and they're getting their nitrogen
that way and that's how they're producing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using nitrates and then they don't
need sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bacteria do, but not those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're feeding some bacteria,
but it goes back to the point of,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, so how are you getting the food
where they need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that the bacteria is
microscopic and again, moving a millimeter
[SPEAKER_01]: is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're broadcasting the sugar solution
on top of your soil, is it getting to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria because it's like dropping a
fruit basket in Russia and hoping the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: in Iowa are going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to happen and they're
going to get it before somebody eats it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be intercepted at the point
of contact and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: intercepted within nanometers more so than
millimeters or even inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it's going to get to
where it's going to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of these bacteria do trade with
plants for sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes back to nitrogen fixing
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They trade nitrogen for sugar with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're going to be the guy in the
middle and you're going to give it sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: why would it trade nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is just as lazy as the laziest
human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take free every time they
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this with our legume plants that if
we give them too much nitrogen at
[SPEAKER_01]: planting, or early on, they don't build
the associations with the bacteria because
[SPEAKER_01]: they get it for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you make an economic trade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants build sugars and they trade
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy nitrogen with sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we give them too much nitrogen,
they don't buy any nitrogen with sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they run out of what we supply,
then they're in short supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to build the factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this as a biological fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying have a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a good job of managing your plants and
the biology below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, for the most part, going to take
care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that the nitrobactors
primarily use carbon, but then they also
[SPEAKER_00]: receive sugar from the plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nitrobactors don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, other nitrogen producing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you were... That was a little
confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different bacteria groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my words a little jumbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrobacter are looking for the carbon
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why... The carbon source is often
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: C6H12O6.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what you're talking about is
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting it from so many sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can even taste soil and it
has a sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so much potential out there
that adding a little bit agriculturally is
[SPEAKER_01]: like eating a pinch of sugar and calling
it your food for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want a little clarification there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great that farmers are trying
new things and experimenting and learning
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think we have a long way to go
in this industry, more so than even most
[SPEAKER_00]: industries out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it intelligently and based
off of a strict scientific model that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us good information for making
decisions on our farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say thank you so much,
