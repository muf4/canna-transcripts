[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this podcast, I caught up with Brian
Anderson to talk about cultivation through
[SPEAKER_02]: the eyes of an architect.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we design our facilities to be
compliant with local laws?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we be more efficient?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the methodology of different
growth styles impact your design?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian is a founding partner of Anderson
Porter Design, an international practice
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on design and architecture for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anderson Porter Design provides strategy,
technology, design, and thought leadership
[SPEAKER_02]: built on 20 years as a general practice in
architecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since 2014, they are focused on buildings
for plants, controlled environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture, extraction, manufacturing,
and retail dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian merges an RISD education in the
craft tradition of making and designing
[SPEAKER_02]: objects with an analytic data-driven
process to drive value along with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a master's degree from Harvard and
has been in practice since 1992.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anderson provides professional leadership
in strategic planning and design.
[SPEAKER_02]: He speaks nationally on energy
sustainability in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: facility design, and on interior design
for retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the time to chat today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I met you at Photo X this past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little crazy to think about how we
used to get together for conferences right
[SPEAKER_02]: now with this quarantine going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really enjoyed chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to talk to you about this
sort of architecture perspective that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start off just giving listeners a
little bit of your background and talking
[SPEAKER_02]: a little about who you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in Arlington, Massachusetts,
suburb of Cambridge in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an architect and principal of
Anderson Porter Design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been an architect for 26 years,
and 20 of those years really as a general
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioner, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of in that mix of projects
that we'd done that things came together
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that luck is the intersection of
preparedness and opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that opportunity came for us in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the preparedness was just that very
specific things in our background as
[SPEAKER_00]: architects that we had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Eastern Massachusetts,
and a lot around us is biotech,
[SPEAKER_00]: biofarm, and the like, and medical device
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have done a lot of work in medical
device manufacturing, and those are clean
[SPEAKER_00]: room environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are staff that wear Tyvek suits and
hair nets and beard nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really lined up in the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had been the architects for the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, which is a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: big role to play from 1999 to 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you remember, September 11,
2001 happened right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a very deep background in both
physical and electronic security as it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2014, a lot of folks coming to
us had never spoken to the chief of police
[SPEAKER_00]: before, let alone the fire marshal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been people traditionally to be
avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came along and we were somebody who
could speak to their language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also spoke the language of biofarm
and clean rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a background in retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually practice in a lot of retail
work in cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since 2014, that has now taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our first group here in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now work, we opened up a virtual office
in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fullerton, California, this year in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do projects in Central Europe,
North Macedonia, as well as throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really enjoyed chatting with you
because you had a totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective on cultivation than I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: My focus has always been on, you know,
primarily on soil, soil biology and that
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really came at it from sort of a
regulatory perspective, a structural and
[SPEAKER_02]: workflow perspective that I thought was
sort of unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about sort of
what an architect's perspective is
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding a facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where do you start the conversation
when you talk to a grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as a grower, a lot of times you're
coming from a background like mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really think about these sorts
of things in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to understand
that this is not necessarily an
[SPEAKER_00]: architect's point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine comes from, in addition to what I
sort of described there quickly as my
[SPEAKER_00]: background, when I talk to growers about
how to approach the grow, it comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in lean manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot in our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mention that earlier,
but it influences how we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation from a workflow and work
practice perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as, so in lean, if you know lean
in manufacturing and lean in enterprise,
[SPEAKER_00]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: business, it's about organizing things to
eliminate waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we look at cultivation facilities
and manufacturing facilities for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, manufacturing is anything from
pills to vape cartridges to pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an efficient flow to the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we line up the steps that you take
by interviewing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we interview the grower to understand
how they grow, what's important,
[SPEAKER_00]: what soil media they use, cocoa versus
rockwool versus living soil, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to arrange the spaces needed for
people to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything from, you know, let's
arrange the shipping bay and the receiving
bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we have a quarantine space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody today, you know, due to COVID,
we all sort of understand quarantine in a
[SPEAKER_00]: new way and how important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring in some
distributor's junk and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: beetle encased in a wooden pallet into
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, so we're thinking about
factors that are related to the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that affect work and affect the health
and maintenance and safety, ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: of how to protect the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of weaving in things that we
learned from lean and efficiency and work
[SPEAKER_00]: process to the physical things like how to
build a quarantine room so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: push things effectively in from the
shipping bay, the dirty side, and pull
[SPEAKER_00]: things out from the clean, let's say your
harvest corridor is a clean corridor where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are observing, you know,
good manufacturing practices and good
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've already been through a,
you know, the workforce comes in through
[SPEAKER_00]: an air pressure zone or, you know,
an airlock, and they may have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gowned up in a Tyvek suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that those two worlds kind of don't
overlap, that they're always separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way that we look at breaking
down the work into its parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really glad you brought up a
quarantine space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that I was hoping you
would address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of those things that
sometimes gets overlooked in facilities or
[SPEAKER_02]: when people try to adapt buildings that
weren't originally designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're building from the ground
up, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're having to come into a space
that's already been already been built,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't agree with you more that
that's such an important aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you talk about lean,
interestingly enough, I've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: gentleman, Ben Hartman, on the podcast
talking about the lean farm, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at outdoor farming from a lean
perspective, which was a big mental gap
[SPEAKER_02]: for me versus, you know, this this more
facility based manufacturing perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really a balance in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of growers don't think about the
fact that, you know, when you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: by yourself on a medical side with 25
lights, maybe you and one other person,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't really need to think about your
workflow as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you try and expand that to 10,
15, 20, 20 times that size workflow,
[SPEAKER_02]: the number of steps you take in the day,
the number of times you have to handle a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular material, that waste adds up
really, really fast and takes up a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's ever been a grunt on a on a
construction site or anybody who's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: been a grunt in a in a in a farming
environment knows that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your boss says, pick that pile up and move
it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after lunch, you're told,
pick that pile up and move it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever been in that situation,
that's completely not lean.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving things once, knowing, you know,
never setting something down on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about an organized workspace where
nothing ever gets set down on the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's just time, time to set it
down, time to move around and pick it back
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of how many more transplants you
could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it how much time does it take to
take a clipping from a mom and put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy clone machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how quickly can you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in if you're growing 25
plants, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a hundred thousand
plants and you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one crew just broke down a room and
harvested it and your job is to populate
[SPEAKER_00]: it now in the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time doesn't slip on the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time does it take to put,
you know, fifteen hundred clones in an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy cloner and move the, you know,
the, you know, the ready ones out?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to eliminate wasted steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the examples that Ben gives
when he gives his talk to a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: audience is he'll he'll bring a bunch of
envelopes and he'll have people come up
[SPEAKER_02]: front and he'll have one group do the
envelopes like putting a stamp on them,
[SPEAKER_02]: sealing them, putting the letter in all
without setting down the envelope,
[SPEAKER_02]: go through all the steps at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other group will do the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they'll they'll stuff the envelope
and they'll stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll stuff 50 envelopes and then
they'll go back and they'll lick and close
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 envelopes and then they'll add the
stamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would think that doing the same
motion over and over again, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the second option there of doing all
50 stuffing at once would be faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually takes so much longer
because you're having to retouch and set
[SPEAKER_02]: down these envelopes so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really cool thought experiment that
anyone can try at home kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, we call them design games.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are sort of interactive games that
use game theory to teach fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I'm involved in doing a lot
of those teaching exercises for Lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one called the airplane game and
you have a team with Legos to assemble
[SPEAKER_00]: this airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're told exactly how many Legos to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rules set it up so that it's very
similar to the envelope stuffing game,
[SPEAKER_00]: which teaches that lesson that the fewer
times you pick something up and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and the better the communication
amongst the team that's doing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can eliminate enormous amounts of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many times it's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you rely on your gut,
we often get things wrong in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about what takes the most time
versus what would be a shorter way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say time, we're not talking
about rushing or moving faster necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: than the other group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about just moving more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about speeding up the employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about making the steps that
they're having to take, take less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes up so in facility design
around around, you know, grow facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking it down all the way to its parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that many people will feel forced
to accept things that you may actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those could be things like walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people don't think to move the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about the amount of
money that's being spent and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: money at stake, moving and rearranging
walls within a building can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: workflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times we accept the way things are
like, well, this building only has 600
[SPEAKER_00]: amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could really use 1200 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it only has six on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only going to make my grow fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times those have to do with money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these everything's impacted by money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the work of architecture is
to break down a lot of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: assumed and challenging those assumptions
so that we can change things and adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that ultimately the finished
product works in the most effective and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask, so what are some of the
common pitfalls that you see when coming
[SPEAKER_02]: onto a project like this from from your
perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you already mentioned one of as a
grower feeling limited by the structure in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of you that may actually be
adaptable if you can kind of step out of
[SPEAKER_02]: that box.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what other things might you see in
terms of in terms of that perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you mentioned it earlier,
which is this idea of understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an architect, we're trained to look
at things from the point of view of who's
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OSHA, for example, the occupational
safety and hazard of workers protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: worker safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at OSHA, we look at building
codes, establishing how to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: building the most quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at in case of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we look at things through the
eyes of the fire marshal or we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: things through the eyes of a of a state
regulator, like the cannabis regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator in each state is going to want
to see certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we start from we start from that
because we know that that's an absolute if
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't pass that that inspection,
it was all for not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take those and we order things around
life safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has to do with choosing of wall
materials so that they comply with being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be wiped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about aseptic conditions,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floor materials, wall materials,
ceilings, making sure that we can put
[SPEAKER_00]: ceilings in so that because, you know,
how impossible it is to clean around
[SPEAKER_00]: ductwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want a messy, you know,
all that duct and junk up above your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do we think about it in terms
of, you know, we're sprinkler heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we mix the life safety from the
systems to the life safety from the
[SPEAKER_00]: building materials and then flow of work,
you know, ordering the group, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so ordering the number of rooms,
grow rooms, how many should there be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we work very, very closely
with growers to establish their grow
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, because that has to do with the
fundamental units of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many, you know, how many clone rooms,
how many veg rooms, how many mom rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, think about, well, is it is it
really just one or should we make it two?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if something happens to
your moms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to clean that room out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do when you're cleaning out
your mom room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need another one for the overflow to,
you know, making sure that the bedroom is
[SPEAKER_00]: is is sized properly to handle the number
of throughput for your final flower count
[SPEAKER_00]: to establishing exactly the right room
dimensions for the flower rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, based on number of lights or
based on whether you're using tiered you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, pip racks, pip style, you know,
moveable benches or whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: flat GGS roll pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things have dimensional
requirements right down to door sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say is the most what
comes into play the most common,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's fun having it's for me
professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fun having a certain set of
skills that I learned as an architect and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding them really, really adaptable to,
you know, when talking to growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about, gee, you know,
let's make this door 42 inches wide
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it'd be easier to get a cart
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's and the response is like,
oh, yeah, you know, like we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to bang our knuckles on the
door jams every time we're pushing a cart
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sometimes it's really simple
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where to put an RFID, you know,
batch reader or how to work with and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to integrate data collection so that a
grow could, you know, accelerate through
[SPEAKER_00]: through big data, essentially through data
collection and machine learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything from the tech side to
the sort of fundamental or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: concrete side of how wide to make a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say which which which
precedes the other, but putting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: all in order is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's one thing we've
thought about with the type of growing
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do is how if you're growing in a
bed, if you do need to remove a bed from a
[SPEAKER_02]: room and it fits nicely on a pallet,
how do do we have a door frame that allows
[SPEAKER_02]: us to move the pallet in and out with a
pallet jack, which is saves a ton of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to get to the door and then
have to shovel it, you know, through that
[SPEAKER_02]: door space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a that's a really important
consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you are you finding, though,
that regulations always line up with
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal cultivation practices?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any good example of a time
when regulations regulation kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: limited the ability of a cultivation
facility or a grower to really do what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll point to a recent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the state of Illinois has stepped
in it in a bad way when they outlawed
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Illinois in their latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Issue has made it not possible for farmers
to grow cannabis outdoor in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what that does from a just
from a carbon perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that all cannabis grown in the
state of Illinois has to be grown indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: under lights or in a closed greenhouse
with a mixed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very efficient to grow
outdoors, like soybean growers and corn
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in Illinois aren't complaining
about the DLI and the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't cannabis be allowed to
grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that state law affects in a
big way what we do as an industry and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to do as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make an easy prediction
that a lot more carbon is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed in Illinois with light fixtures
and construction and all the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: if your grow plan is to produce for a
broad spectrum distillate and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be extracting everything, then outdoor
would be a great way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And save and save costs and save energy
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the state of Illinois is outlawed
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another maybe the one that gets a lot of
press is that thirty six watt per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came out of the Massachusetts
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my home state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the jury's out as to whether it its
intent is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its intent was to limit high pressure
sodium lamps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of high pressure was to limit the
use of high pressure sodium, HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: double ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that puts a cramp in a lot of people's
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if your knowledge base entirely
was based on growing under HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that requirement is going to seem
completely foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not technically disallow high
pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it spreads the lights out too far,
if a five and a half foot grid is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable, it has to be a four by four
and a half that may exceed the lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: power density.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other things that can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ways in which that can be
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if it's a deep,
deep rabbit hole to get into is the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between LED and HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one area in which the law is
trying to mess around and has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers twisted around the axle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's it also raises your
cost potentially to as traditionally LED
[SPEAKER_02]: lights are going to be more expensive than
that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's such a range of quality in the
LED market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know that people have made poor
lighting decisions for an entire facility
[SPEAKER_02]: and come to regret it, which actually
brings me to another point that you
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up in our in our email exchange,
which was around the idea of growers
[SPEAKER_02]: picking a path and sort of sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of elaborate elaborate on
that and kind of what you meant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one role one role that I
play often with groups is trying to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: going to trade shows and falling in love
with the newest, shiniest object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there are in the past six years,
it seems like every three months a new
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of equipment comes out, comes to
market, and that can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the newest, shiniest object,
you know, comes out of the trade show and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have spent in order amount of time
researching that newest thing and really
[SPEAKER_00]: chasing it to ground to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only to find out it may not even be UL
listed, right, or it doesn't have certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's not listed on the DLI index
of approved lighting or it's right that
[SPEAKER_00]: following really.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I put this like sticking to
traditional grows and not venturing out
[SPEAKER_00]: into new technology is usually a wise
decision, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing to getting to scale on with with
with achievable means is important as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to trusting in one piece of
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a as a as a as a solution, I don't know
if that's quite answers your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in my experience, the cannabis
industry has some of the some of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: marketers and I guess I would almost say
like snake oil salesman when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times you'll find that these
products are unproven.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the science to back them
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you mentioned, they may not even
make regulatory requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you will find a grower that will go
and that's building a facility will go and
[SPEAKER_02]: see something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights are probably the easiest example of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea of scaling a facility and
making such a large investment in an
[SPEAKER_02]: unproven technology is, I think,
really, really challenging, even when they
[SPEAKER_02]: give it to you at a discount, which I see
that happen quite a bit with these
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, too, is they're like,
well, this one company is going to give me
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty good deal on on these lights or
on this technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, it's very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a new game in town in
the past couple of years, which is foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: investors who have set up companies in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the hook that you call it that the
snake snake oil salesman uses is,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we're going to finance this for you,
right, because they know that getting
[SPEAKER_00]: finance for this facility is the is one of
the main hurdles to getting open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if and if a salesman comes along and
says, hey, we've got this new technology
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to finance it for you,
it becomes really easy trap to fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a that's something to be to be
very wary of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are groups out that are that are
making their products seem like they've
[SPEAKER_00]: solved everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get under the hood,
you realize, oh, you can never change out
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if that light isn't really what you
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't change it, right, because it's part
of a part of a machine that you bought
[SPEAKER_00]: that's designed to grow weed for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all automated and it's all built
in to the box and you can't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot
of things coming to market that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't invest a massive amount of money and
hinge your success on an unprecedented
[SPEAKER_00]: proven technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now, I do like the idea if there's
room in the facility to have sort of an R
[SPEAKER_02]: &D space that allows you to trial
different things that may or may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements on your current facility
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's something that
you're able to design into many of the
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings that you're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that into the best in class
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have space, if we have a client with
a grow team who acknowledges the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: R &D, that for me is are some of the are
the best facilities we've designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that you've represented to
your investors what your yield is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be based on the number of plants and the
strains and your narratives, your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: narratives.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you then can afford the space to have
two or three rooms set aside that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: call them R&D rooms, you're going to do a
couple of things for that grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give your grower and your
organization the ability to test new
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, bring new products to market,
investigate and fool around in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: way that's not detracting from your yields
that your investors are counting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, and this is the hidden benefit
of having an R&D space, is that becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: relief valve, a kind of sacrificial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong in your general
population, you could evacuate a room and
[SPEAKER_00]: move it into one of those R&D spaces,
sacrificing everything in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing that out to save what is your
core crop that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thing that might not be thought
about in the first order, but it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: into play more often than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people had something go wrong,
but you've got nowhere to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could just empty out that room and
actually put it in a vacant room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd save the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think having an R&D space,
even though you may not want to sacrifice
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a pinch, you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those hidden benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know from working closely with
Goldleaf, they have five or six flower
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, I can't remember offhand,
and they're all essentially identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: While they don't have a dedicated R&D
space, based on the limitations of the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and their production needs,
they are able to do research in a given
[SPEAKER_02]: room every cycle, looking at ways of being
innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing out a different irrigation system,
in this case, looking at the blue mats
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the way they were hand watering,
allowed them to see an ROI, that their
[SPEAKER_02]: return on investment by switching the
whole facility over was going to save them
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of dollars in labor over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the course of whatever given period
they established for their ROI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making a lighting change in one room
allows them to decide if that lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: change should be made across the entire
facility without risking your entire crop
[SPEAKER_02]: and without risking too much of your
profits at the end of the day to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that idea because to commit fully
to a new technology or a new innovation or
[SPEAKER_02]: even a new workflow, I think, is risky
without some research, some actual data to
[SPEAKER_02]: back up and support what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a lighting perspective, it's also
important to realize that your mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that are balancing your relative
humidity, temperature, and vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit are really balanced based on the
heat output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those set points for HPS don't
work for LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever those changes are made or if
those changes are anticipated,
[SPEAKER_00]: it must be understood that the set points
on the mechanical systems have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the room is going to behave
entirely the wrong way under a new light
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're going from, let's just say,
from double-ended HPS to LED, wouldn't you
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially have overbuilt your facility
so your set points would drop?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could still use the equipment that
you had in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just more than you would need,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you have a different experience or
thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say that each case is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, you've overbuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some ways, it's an entirely new
animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just that you're dialing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that your sensible loads and your
latent loads may have changed
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about leaf temperature
in those two different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to balance that with a –
and this is where I don't want to overstep
[SPEAKER_00]: my professional limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a professional engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that leaf temperature and set
points make a huge difference in crop
[SPEAKER_00]: performance and that it's a delicate
balance when you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the systems that maintain
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always as easy as just
resetting the automation system or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your controllers that are
controlling those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's the temperature and
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it needs to look at how well
it's dehumidifying and testing that to be
[SPEAKER_00]: assured that all the parts are working
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you talk about changes in
technology like lighting, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the other things that we discussed
was some of these new styles of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about a facility that wants to bring
in multi-tier racking into an existing
[SPEAKER_02]: room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even a new facility, what are some of
the challenges associated with these types
[SPEAKER_02]: of cultivation methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cost goes up enormously simply because,
A, the cost of multi-tier racking is much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than single-tier benching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, two, the cost of air distribution
goes up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about a typical room with
a single-tier bench, you can drop air in
[SPEAKER_00]: from your system at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And circulate that around and recycle it
back through the either rooftop unit or
[SPEAKER_00]: however you're handling your air,
your air handling unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a multi-tiered system now, you need to
get air into that space between racks as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just drop it in from the top and
hope to cool evenly and evenly distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: the air throughout the, over all the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one thing that drives up cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost is one big hurdle, but there are huge
efficiencies that go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: To grow, right, you can double your plant
count or maybe 1.5 times your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have differences in labor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some adjustments that have to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we advise people to do if
they're thinking about doing two-tiered
[SPEAKER_00]: racking systems is to start out in half
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going in a phased approach,
put, always start out with the method that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to employ in the future,
right, in the future phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of thinking about just doing
single-tier racks as your phase one and
[SPEAKER_00]: then two-tier racks as your phase two,
rather start out with half the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, but do the two-tiered racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way your labor becomes familiar
with the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you increase to your phase
two, you don't have to learn something
[SPEAKER_00]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fundamentally, if you are constrained for
space and want to increase your yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way to go is up, right,
to multi-tier things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you probably understand that
implicitly in the veg, in the case of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, almost everybody tiers their veg
plants because that gives you more room
[SPEAKER_00]: for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the same thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we do it in cases where we're
retrofitting former used buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe half of our work is retrofit versus
new build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when an existing building,
if you have space limitations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't have height limitations,
then going up is a natural solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you build higher yields per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not done a three-tier grow yet,
but we've done a lot of two-tiered grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: PIP style racking systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any of those in flower
rooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do see a lot in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it makes a lot of sense in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about flour, though,
have you seen this successful with anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: doing purely organic production?
[SPEAKER_00]: In two tiers?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have not personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with Mike Zartarian, who you know,
and he's been my counsel on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, no-till soil and organic living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've learned from him is that,
yeah, it's just, it's harder to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you ever have to change that
out, that's just the weight and volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volume of soil on two levels is a
bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been one of my main takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just stuck with me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to work with organic and
living soil on two levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I was just curious if you'd seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a few people doing it right
now, but it has yet to be really proven to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an existing facility that's
been running for a while, on two tiers
[SPEAKER_02]: using organics or living soils,
please reach out to me and let me know
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever is listening to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know some that are being set up
right now that I'm following closely,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking forward to see how they turn out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope to do some research with it,
either at Goldleaf or my buddies at Legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't gotten around to it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad, I'll take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I are doing one currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very small grow, maybe 930
square feet of bench area in a 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great, great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: My memory's been jogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, in fact, have one that is two-tiered
organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yet built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been designed, but it's not yet been
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have data on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'd be happy to follow up with you
and get after its first harvest to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some data on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll reach out to you and Mike on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take me through a little bit of the
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone is going into this as an
investor or as a grower trying to set up a
[SPEAKER_02]: new facility, they would want to talk to
someone like you, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other key players in this
planning process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are those key players?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think should be involved if
someone's really interested in properly
[SPEAKER_02]: setting up a new grow facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a really good approach or
good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we approach that is that when I
started this work six years ago in 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what horticulture process
engineering was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I coined that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly, by 2019 last year,
I don't do any jobs without a hort process
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Mike Sartarian, Tony Vanys is
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great folks around the
country who serve that role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the primary things in
the way we practice that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, it's because I'm
humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't claim to know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing plants is in my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually grew up on a Christmas tree
farm in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have put things in the dirt and added
lime and various nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't claim to be an expert on
everything horticultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing on that expertise to my team
is step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding my customers' KPIs,
key performance indicators, is really step
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is where the money comes
from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that promise that we make to our
investors that allows us to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding those KPIs is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if manufacturing is part of the plan,
then bringing in somebody with an
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise, let's say it's ethanol,
an ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll bring in that person on our
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting the team, I guess what I'm
underscoring here is getting the team
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the growers' perspective and from the
entrepreneurs' perspective, it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about process and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the entrepreneurs, from the C-suite,
the CEO, CFO, COO, it's about those KPIs
[SPEAKER_00]: and managing the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the entire process,
meaning there's a facility, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole building, and it's made up of
certain key parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulture is first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second is manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is management of the
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding that the employees have a
break room and that they have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom and shower facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting the team right is part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of players that help at the
various stages, so civil engineers that
[SPEAKER_00]: lay out parking and figure out the
boundaries and the topography of the site
[SPEAKER_00]: and what can be put where.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we work very closely with civil
engineers on every job that we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's an existing building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have a civil engineer who is the
one who really interfaces with the town
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to getting permits at the
early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work closely with legal counsel
with our customers, understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: their obligations are legally,
what their stage they're in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing process, so that the work and
planning for the facility lines up neatly
[SPEAKER_00]: with their licensing process and with
their capital draws when their funding is
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the hard things in cannabis
is everybody knows is the start,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop, start, stop, start, stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gas and break, gas and break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to work with customers on sort
of capex planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to team building, it's
understanding when capital is needed and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much so that our customers can talk
intelligently to their funders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say, here's a milestone,
this is what the whole team is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what it's gonna cost to get to
that milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the next milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what the team needs to do to get to
that milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, see down, way down there in the
distance, that's milestone number three,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where we start to turn a
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with our customers to give
them that ability to communicate at that
[SPEAKER_00]: level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you know what the milestone coming
up is, you know who all your team members
[SPEAKER_00]: are, that are contributing to that,
to the success of that milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can better evaluate risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the risk if we don't hit
the milestone or if somebody tells us no
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about team building and then about
good forecasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little scary to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just even when you say it like this,
I think of all the steps and costs
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with setting up a new facility
and it can be pretty massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, there's so many hurdles
along the way that people don't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: when they first get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in some states like Oklahoma,
it's fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other states like where you are,
it can be really challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like looking at it from a grower's
perspective, myself, like all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff is sort of things that I don't want
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get in there and start
working with some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the reality of the fact that this
if you want to do this commercially and
[SPEAKER_02]: legally, you have to start thinking of it
like a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to take away from the art
and craft of cultivation and the science
[SPEAKER_02]: around cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just these are the steps that you're
going to have to go through just to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to allow the government to allow you
to do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ted, you reminded me of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we met at the photo X photo biology
conference in Austin, Texas, last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the presenters there hit something
home for me, which is that just because we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to grow it doesn't mean it's what the
customer wants to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a mantra that makes a
lot of sense to me because I meet a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks coming in and.
[SPEAKER_00]: They point and they say, I want one of
those, meaning a cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't yet know what their
customers demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never really pulled their
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just this sort of general attitude
out there that everybody wants to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can grow weed, I can mint money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the industry is maturing now
to a level where people really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in on not just we're going to grow,
we're going to grow cannabis, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow really good cannabis, we're going
to grow prize cannabis, but rather is
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the customer base and
saying, which are we selling only to
[SPEAKER_00]: boomer women who are over 65 years old?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're focused down to a really
specific customer group, understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: those people want and produce what that
demand dictates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a different idea about that's the
sort of business approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that you can't grow the
best weed you've ever grown or get to do
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow the way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really understanding what is the
output and who is it intended for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point because I know
a lot for a lot of growers like high end
[SPEAKER_02]: flour is the is sort of the end all be
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet here in Washington, the market has
changed to where a lot of stuff is going,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being made into distillate or
edibles or even pre rolls that become
[SPEAKER_02]: really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's funny because from a growing
perspective, they're like, I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can roll my own joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather see the flour and have good
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not necessarily what's moving
off the shelves as quickly and not
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone can produce high end flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's only room for so many people
at the top of that pyramid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is something to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what what is your audience in
all of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of transitions the sort of
to my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you brought up,
which wasn't a term that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly familiar with when we started
talking about it was this idea of toll
[SPEAKER_02]: processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about what toll
processing is and how it fits in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry and what the potential
is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a trend here in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, which is that it's not that
hard to spot, which is that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of profit to be made in processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just a farmer, you know,
field gating, you know, at wholesale
[SPEAKER_00]: prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can turn it into a product,
there's a much higher margin to be to be
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from the from at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually when when our customers
now we have I'm seeing it over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: when they have a choice of phasing their
construction based on limited dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: our customers are choosing to build the
processing facility first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an interesting trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next trend that I'm seeing,
we have another customer who is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically asked us to design the
processing, which is extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: post extraction, the white film,
the flowing film, the winterizing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: and the to get to broad spectrum
distillate and the manufacturing piece to
[SPEAKER_00]: size that for a capacity that exceeds what
they're what they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a way of, you know,
estimating grow, you know, at let's take
[SPEAKER_00]: an average number of 40 grams,
42 grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you calculate from that that you can
do five thousand pounds a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toll processing would be where you would
you would create the capacity to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: handle ten thousand pounds a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's five thousand pounds of biomass
that you can buy from other growers at
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale and process and put out product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So toll processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a toll road means you pay that you
pay to drive on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would pay you would, you know,
for the processor who was doing toll
[SPEAKER_00]: processing is doing is not just in many
cases, they're not just a processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a grower, but they will
actually buy in excess of what they can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow themselves at wholesale and then be
able to manufacture more than what they
[SPEAKER_00]: could otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that occur on the other end,
like on the propagation side?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know here in Washington, there was a
company when we first switched over to rec
[SPEAKER_02]: called the Clone Zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were able to fund their build out
of a new facility based off of selling
[SPEAKER_02]: clones to the rest of the Washington
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it first got started, because
everyone was looking for plants at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning, they had all the hype cultivars
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a really smart business move
for them to provide, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: provide starts for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a lot of challenges from an
IPM perspective and insects and liability
[SPEAKER_02]: around all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the potential for a business
opportunity there, I think, is really high
[SPEAKER_02]: in new states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I so I told you that I
grew up on a Christmas tree farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's no there's not a
Christmas tree farmer in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: who grows their own tree from seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state fills that role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody buys seedlings,
which we would call a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small, a young plant coming,
you know, with a root system from a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you're talking about now is a
mature horticulture market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar in flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly true in trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about every nursery you drive by.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you know, that's what the name
implies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the landscape industry,
there are that's that's what a mature
[SPEAKER_00]: market looks like, where you have
different businesses set up to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis is otherwise unique in
the fact that it tackles the whole piece
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's coming out of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a dictate because it's been under
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as as as the industry,
you know, matures, people will find
[SPEAKER_00]: business opportunities with small niches
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this idea of toll processing,
to get back to that idea, really mitigates
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the risks associated with poor
crop performance or crop loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, you know what you're
buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already a commodity at this point,
and then you can manufacture it into
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you already know what the market will
bear on that end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the risk associated with it,
it would be much lower, I would I would
[SPEAKER_02]: assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk is lower and the profit margins
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the cost to get in is more
expensive, though, which you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as you as you know, when you've
looked at, you know, ethanol processing
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, that's expensive buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cheap entry point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the ROI is certainly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Brian, just to change directions one
last time here, one of the things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: and I talked about when we were waiting at
the airport was some of the stuff you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing around cannabis advocacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were kind of sharing some of your
thoughts around the direction of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry on more of a national
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk a little about what
you have going on on that side of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put in sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put in two big plugs, shameless plugs
to nonprofit organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I volunteer with the NCIA, the National
Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of time in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chair a committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're called the Facilities Design
Committee as an appropriate place for an
[SPEAKER_00]: architect, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a committee that I actually
started didn't exist before this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming up to the end of a one
year term.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 10 of us who are active from
Sacramento to Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet once a month and we're making some
good progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be pushing out information for
growers about facilities through the NCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of podcasts, not to
compete with UTAD, but NCIA does also host
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for some information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: NCIA does webinars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously have trade shows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one coming up in San Francisco at
the end of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three ways in which the NCIA's
Facility Design Committee is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its main mission is advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it does a pretty good job as well
of getting information out to members and
[SPEAKER_00]: to nonmembers alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other group is out of Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called RII Resource Innovation
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derek Smith is the director and I
volunteer a lot with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a webinar last week for
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan growers called Efficient Yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more information on their
website, RII's website, about their
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient Yields webinar program.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Michigan, there's more coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got one slated for Massachusetts
growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do a really good job of
harnessing when you want to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion around sustainability and
efficiency in energy consumption and water
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and how to interface with the
utilities and RII is doing a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: work in getting growers to talk to utility
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to run away from the utilities
because they were the people who would
[SPEAKER_00]: report us to the police kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: An early relationship with the utilities
is really key to a facility's success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting your power on time, getting it
non-interrupted, getting the right amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of power or gas, if it's a gas pipeline or
electrical service.
[SPEAKER_00]: RII does a really good job of advocating
for growers and bringing growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: utility companies together in discussions
around energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big plug for Derek Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high six figures that our
customers are getting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the difference in cost,
the high cost of LED lighting fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many claims out there that the
cost is based on the fact that the rebates
[SPEAKER_00]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can pay $330 for a double-ended
HPS, why would you spend $1,200 to $1,500
[SPEAKER_00]: for an LED light fixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many of the reasons are because in
certain states, 70% of that delta is paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for by the utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings that cost down enormously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking early to your utility about
rebates is key to the success of a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be sure to put on the website page
links to both of those websites as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: your website so people can check that out
on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, I really appreciate your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to talking and
hopefully working with you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been talking about this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great day, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Brian Anderson with Anderson
Porter Design, and you were listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cannabis Cultivation and Science
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey.

[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been documenting a greenhouse
trial with tomatoes and mulch and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: barley on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done a couple of virtual live
tours already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We toured Maincraft Cannabis and Simply
Green Farms in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other tours lined up with David
Bernard Perrone to tour the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: organic cannabis facility in the world and
some others from all around the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great chance to see inside these
groves and ask questions directly live to
[SPEAKER_02]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
