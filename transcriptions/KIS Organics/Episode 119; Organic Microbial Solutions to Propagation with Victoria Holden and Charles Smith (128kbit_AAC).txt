[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guests this week are Victoria Holden
and Charles Smith with a short appearance
[SPEAKER_01]: by Ben Higgins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria and Charles are the co-founders
of Emeo and in this podcast, we discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: their products and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: They currently have brought two products
to market, an organic microbial-based
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting powder and gel and a
microbial-based solution for breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass faster, which has broad
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is over a year in the making
as we wanted to run trials at Goldleaf
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens with Dr. Ben Higgins to see how
the organic cloning product worked and get
[SPEAKER_01]: some independent data on our end.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many microbial products on
the market these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to separate out the
marketing from research and determine
[SPEAKER_01]: what's worth using in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to make sure that all the
products we offer at Kiss Organics or talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about on the podcast have legitimate
research and value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria has a lifelong interest in
studying the interactions between microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and their surrounding environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: She earned her PhD in microbiology and
immunology from the University of Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: before moving to Dartmouth College to
further her studies with postdoctoral
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: As chief scientist and finance officer of
Emeo, Victoria has led the development and
[SPEAKER_01]: productions of multiple microbial products
that replace harmful chemicals and enable
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier, more productive cultivation of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charles started Emeo to dedicate his
career to helping people, plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: After graduating from Dartmouth College,
he began his career at Morgan Stanley,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he focused on the technology sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved on from finance to join a New
York-based software startup, where he
[SPEAKER_01]: gained valuable insight into scaling
companies and teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: As CEO of Emeo, Charles manages business
development and operations as the company
[SPEAKER_01]: works to unlock plant productivity and
restore our planet through the power of
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Charles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Victoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having us, Tad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You share a ton of great knowledge here,
and we're very happy to be part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are co-founders of Emeo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you guys through another connection,
learning about some of the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came into this sort of a little bit
skeptical, but through some trials that we
[SPEAKER_01]: ran, which we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the other trials, I'm really
excited to talk about what you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start off with a little bit
of an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charles, I know you guys are co-founders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about your
role and who you are?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to say briefly,
Tad, totally appreciate the skepticism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good to put products through
their paces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate the data-driven approach
that you took to getting to know our
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate our technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of kind of backstory,
I'm the co-founder and CEO of Emeo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I lead sort of our business development
and operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Victoria is our chief science officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she is the real technical brains behind
actually making these products a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the backstory on Emeo started with
really wanting to dedicate our careers
[SPEAKER_03]: into doing good things for the planet and
recognizing the huge opportunity that
[SPEAKER_03]: natural microorganisms offer in terms of
helping plants grow more effectively and
[SPEAKER_03]: also recapturing valuable nutrients from
things that are otherwise treated as
[SPEAKER_03]: waste.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Victoria, can you tell me a little bit
about yourself as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I earned my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: in microbiology from the University of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of research studying how
microbes interact with their environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for a part of my career that was within
the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made this transition into
wanting to understand more about how
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes interact in our natural
environment and in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really fortunate to meet Charles
at a good time in my career when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to transition into doing something
that could really help the earth in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate timeline than compared to,
say, academic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very happy to be helping to lead the
scientific development and production of
[SPEAKER_00]: Emeo with Charles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we dive into the products and
the microbial process itself, can you tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me a little bit more, I guess a little
more big picture about how you founded the
[SPEAKER_01]: company and what that all looked like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll kick us off there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I sort of alluded to in my
introduction, it started with recognizing
[SPEAKER_03]: what we see as a huge environmental
problem that also presented a really major
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, what we started the company
focused on is the amount of Oregon organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter, food and plant matter that is
treated as waste and the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: repercussions of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you probably know, about a third of
food produced globally is wasted every
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has huge repercussions in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: with the production of methane,
which is an especially potent greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I was kind of digging into that
problem, I wanted to come up with ways
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of the value in that wasted
plant matter could be unlocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may notice that I try very
deliberately not to say plant waste or
[SPEAKER_03]: food waste, because we actually like to
say there's no such thing as plant waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of plant matter is wasted,
but there is a lot of value potential
[SPEAKER_03]: that's left in the stocks and the leaves
and everything that's left over,
[SPEAKER_03]: not eaten or sold or what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as you know very well,
microorganisms are the way that nature
[SPEAKER_03]: deals with that challenge, turn stocks,
leaves, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: into nutrients so that the next generation
of plants can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our idea was that if we can develop a
combination of microbes that can do that
[SPEAKER_03]: job really quickly, consistently,
efficiently, we could make it much more
[SPEAKER_03]: accessible for more people to recycle
their plant matter and do really good
[SPEAKER_03]: things for our planet and for the plants
that people are growing both at home and
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that product became Regen, which is the
first product that we started the company
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some funding from the National
Science Foundation to develop that
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Victoria can speak a little bit more of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then as we're getting out in the
market with Regen and talking to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: really great growers of all sorts of
plants, but especially cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: we came to understand the really large
world of opportunity for microbes to do
[SPEAKER_03]: really good things for people to grow
plants in a more healthy way that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: good for growers in terms of their output
and much better for our planet,
[SPEAKER_03]: both in terms of how we eliminate quote
unquote waste and also replace chemicals
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs with naturally occurring microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some questions for you next,
Victoria, but I have to say the Regen
[SPEAKER_01]: product, I think, is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still wrapping my brain around
some of the applications within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely see them within agriculture
here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we dispose of plant matter makes
it a little bit problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to dive into that a
little more with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I was so excited for and this is
something I think it goes back probably
[SPEAKER_01]: almost a decade now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the organic cannabis side,
there's never been a good organic option
[SPEAKER_01]: for cloning and propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my own little trials and experiment
and ended up with a huge moldy mess trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to create my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, you hear people using
aloe vera with some success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, not being a microbiologist,
I had to go like on the fertility route
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out a solution for
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you guys came up with a microbial
solution for propagation that I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria, can you talk a little bit about
that development process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did you go about once you guys
decided you wanted to create Regen or you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to create Root?
[SPEAKER_01]: What that looks like on your end as a
scientist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start with Root first,
just because that's the one you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: being particularly excited about for this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we came up with the idea to create
this organic natural cloning solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: we first kind of looked at what else
growers were using and what were the
[SPEAKER_00]: components of that product that either
helped it work well or caused these other
[SPEAKER_00]: less exciting potential drawbacks to its
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main things in synthetic cloning
solutions that are good for the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: indole 3 acetic acid and gibberellic acid,
which are two hormones that help develop
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are both hormones that microbes
can produce themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we simply went to published
research, read a lot of papers and tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to find microbes that are naturally
occurring that produce them on their own
[SPEAKER_00]: at concentrations that could be useful to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested a few different combinations of
these microbes, we tested the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: individually, and then started applying
them to plants and seeing which
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations could help the plants root in
a way that didn't involve these synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals that can be really harmful to
people plants and planet, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really started researching what
other people have already done,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them together and moving that
knowledge forward to create the root
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you identified a particular strain
of bacteria or fungi, I don't know a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: about the product, to be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about a little bit with
Charles, but once you identified this,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you go about collecting your
initial specimens and then determining
[SPEAKER_01]: what sort of synergistic effects you might
be looking for getting from the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we proceeded to source these
microbes was by acquiring them from strain
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to seed banks, there are
microbial banks where you can purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then work with them in your own
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's predominantly the way that we
have sourced the microbes in root,
[SPEAKER_00]: though we have done some work with
isolating microbes from the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the time being, root contains
microbes that we've acquired from these
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Piggybacking on that a little bit,
one of the reasons that we take the
[SPEAKER_03]: approach that Victoria described in
identifying what we describe as candidate
[SPEAKER_03]: microbes and then vetting them first
through research, then of course with our
[SPEAKER_03]: own experimentation individually and in a
consortia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important to us that we know
exactly what is in root and regen and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of our inoculants because we want to make
sure that, first of all, we can ensure
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're avoiding spreading any
potential pathogens and anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: could replace what we see as a big
chemical problem with a biological
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our sort of vetting process involves
immediately eliminating any candidate
[SPEAKER_03]: microbes that could become problematic for
people or for animals or of course for the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment if they were to be ingested or
kind of be in a place where we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: expect them to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, that was sort of part of our
rationale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make sure we understand exactly
what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other sort of ongoing benefit to
that from a practical standpoint is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really helpful for production consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, knowing sort of inside and out
every individual bacteria and fungi that
[SPEAKER_03]: is in each of our products allows us to
produce them very consistently,
[SPEAKER_03]: first as an individual microbe and then
ultimately combined in a particular ratio
[SPEAKER_03]: that we found to be most effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the products for propagation,
if we're talking about root here first,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not microbial based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fair statement based on your...
I mean, you guys are more familiar in this
[SPEAKER_01]: area than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that I see are, as far as I know,
salicylic acid or IVA products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal was with this microbial
product to get comparable or better
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was what we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing that this approach differs,
what sort of results are you guys getting
[SPEAKER_01]: with using microbes instead of direct
chemicals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we get great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always aiming to be the best product
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of strains and a lot of
different growth medias, we do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest and most robust rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some strains of cannabis, we're on par
with those synthetic competitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually a result that our trial
with you showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One strain root did better than the
competitor and one strain did exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel great about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a handful of reasons, one is that it's
a real scientific living microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be perfect all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay that it is as good as,
but often better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also provides better long-term results
because you are giving these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic endophytic microbes that benefit
their whole lifespan and not just that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial rooting stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefits are even longer term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some of the results that
we're seeing from our growers now,
[SPEAKER_00]: both better rooting, faster rooting,
shorter time in veg, higher yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: more successful cloning all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel great about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a leaven like myself, essentially,
as I understand it then would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting the same chemicals as I would
in clone X or dip and grow or these other
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available products,
but I'm getting them from this microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction with the soil and water and
plant that then allows for potentially at
[SPEAKER_01]: least comparable, but potentially better
results down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I get 95% propagation
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're seeing the big
differentiation is as the plant starts
[SPEAKER_01]: growing its true leaves, as it gets a
little bigger through veg, you may see
[SPEAKER_01]: some persistence with these microbes that
would lead to better veg growth compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to the control of clone X or dip and grow
or these other commercially available
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to add to that or talk
about some of the research that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're happy to add some of the data
that we've gotten back from some of our
[SPEAKER_03]: customers and growers that we work with
closely.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Victoria described, because root
creates this symbiotic relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants, the benefits do really
continue as the plant keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between a chemical shock
from a clone X or a dip and grow that of
[SPEAKER_03]: course is effective in forming roots,
but then kind of goes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the root microbes continue to live
within the plant tissue, within the roots,
[SPEAKER_03]: within the substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has translated to really exciting
results in the vegetative growth stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our customers have noted reducing
veg cycles from 30 days down to 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the biggest change we had was
maybe like a 28 down to 14 cycle for the
[SPEAKER_03]: veg stage parameters that this grower was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned to add the interactions
within the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, root is a really exciting way
to introduce microbes into the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also into the plant itself,
taking advantage of the access that is
[SPEAKER_03]: created when you dip that cutting directly
into this microbial consortia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that we've seen
translate to really exciting results also
[SPEAKER_03]: in rockwool, in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we're big believers in living
soil ourselves, but we've also seen kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of the benefits of using root in soilless
substrates as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some ways, it's kind of a unique
introduction to microbes in an environment
[SPEAKER_03]: where they can thrive within the plant,
even if the substrate is not kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: optimized for microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing good results in rockwool,
for example, or cocoa core, where you may
[SPEAKER_01]: not have any microbial ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with the chemical mineral salt
program, you can still see results is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me about what's in root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So root is comprised of a few different
families of microbes that all provide some
[SPEAKER_00]: good benefits to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main category that provides a lot of
those benefits are the indole 3 acetic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid or IAA and gibberellic acid
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these microbes make natural versions of
those hormones that are often included in
[SPEAKER_00]: products like Clon-X, Horm-X, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another category of microbes that
are included in our product are
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are microbes that can actually
enter the vascular tissue of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: form symbiotic relationships and help the
plant with things like its health and
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two really important
components of root product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then root also contains a natural
gelling agent called guar gum that's
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated from legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the product that helps form
that gel that growers really often like to
[SPEAKER_00]: dip their clones into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, it contains a little bit of
yeast extract and sugar and those are just
[SPEAKER_00]: included to help the microbes have
something to eat when they are initially
[SPEAKER_00]: woken up from lyophilization or the freeze
drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, speaking of microbes, one of the
things and one of the reasons for my
[SPEAKER_01]: original skepticism is just there's a lot
of people that are, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and products on the market right
now that are microbial based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the fastest growing segments
of I think agriculture in general right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, which most people call
bio-stimulants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the them are just sourcing
bulk powders from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll buy bacillus subtilis because you
can read about some of the research around
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are the differences with MEO and
the advantages associated with culturing
[SPEAKER_01]: your own microbes and controlling that
process versus what many of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just buying these powders and
essentially mixing these microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think our biggest advantage with
the way that we do it, which of course is
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow our microbes from frozen one
milliliter microbial stock into tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: liters of microbes, is that this allows us
to control every step of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to have a lot of room for
quality assurance and quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps us make the product really
consistent because we're growing each
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe individually, combining them at
the ratios that we have determined to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the most beneficial to plants and checking
them along the way through all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: steps of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I've mentioned, these microbes
are alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you aren't able to provide them at
the right stage of their life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be much less consistent,
much less beneficial or often times dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a real concern with on shelf
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Department of Ag have had them
on the podcast and they shared some of
[SPEAKER_01]: their research that they did
independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may not be a reflection of the
original quality of the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the fact that may have been stored in
a warehouse exposed to sunlight,
[SPEAKER_01]: heat, temperature extremes can definitely
degrade products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way you're structured right now is
shipping direct from your facility to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, for example, if someone ordered
root to crit and kiss or a regen,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would ship directly from you to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wouldn't be an issue of
expiration dates, freshness or quality.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot of work to maintain and
check on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've mentioned, we check that the
microbes are still alive at various
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of our own experiments with
cannabis clones and other plants to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the product is working at
different time points of its lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel really strongly that that's the
work we have to do on our end to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're providing customers with a
consistent, strong product.
[SPEAKER_03]: To your point about shipping directly to
growers, that was the only way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: would operate for the earlier stages of
the company when we were shipping out a
[SPEAKER_03]: liquid or gel version of our product
directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that, of course, was a live
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was active.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you described, we needed to be very
conscious of time, of temperature,
[SPEAKER_03]: even thinking about things like pressure
fluctuations, anything that might happen
[SPEAKER_03]: in transit that could damage the health of
the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, of course, as you both were just
saying, the microbes have to be alive to
[SPEAKER_03]: form a symbiotic relationship with the
plant to provide the benefits that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Victoria and our whole science team have
been very hard at work on a freeze drying
[SPEAKER_03]: process called lyophilization,
which Victoria can expand on, but which
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially allows us to take each
individual microbe, run it through this
[SPEAKER_03]: lyophilization process that controls both
temperature and pressure to remove and
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze the moisture from the microbes
without exploding their cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we can send out a shelf stable
powder that essentially has the microbes
[SPEAKER_03]: in a dormant state until water is added
and the product becomes ready to use when
[SPEAKER_03]: the grower is ready to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was an essential step for us from
our perspective before we would entertain
[SPEAKER_03]: any possibilities of there being any steps
between us and the growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you described, we, of course,
continue to love to work directly with
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and working with KISS is going to
be a great way to bring more people into
[SPEAKER_03]: that network.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you said, to also send up directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just wanted to emphasize the efforts
around consistency and ensuring viability.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes every step along our production
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it cumulates with this
lyophilization, this freeze drying process
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we can take out the variables of,
could something go wrong in transit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's a live liquid product,
the answer to that, from our perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: is absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question I had because this is
becoming a bigger issue in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, I can say that we have
had both of our products tested for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently going through all the
state's regulatory processes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: different departments of ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those processes and our products are
all set on that end, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Regen, which is our recycling
product, we have definitely talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who have talked about the fact
that cannabis can be used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaccumulator plant and that when it
grows, it can absorb the heavy metals from
[SPEAKER_00]: its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a concern of repeated cycles
of Regen recycling on hemp or cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that has grown in heavy metal rich soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the impact of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still a lot more testing to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first test that we've done,
it seems to be not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done repeated cycles of Regen
growth and then tested the heavy metals on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that we are very
interested in doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like Charles said before,
small team, lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I just add to that is the
guidance that we tend to give growers if
[SPEAKER_03]: they're concerned that they're sort of on
the edge of permissible levels of heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: metal, we recommend that they do not
recycle the root ball in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I think you know, Ted, the roots tend
to be an area where heavy metals become
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sort of taking that out of the
recycling stream, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, having it end up in another kind
of compost process, but not immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: reintroduced back to your soil or your own
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way that we've handled that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, and as Victoria said,
all the testing that we have done leads us
[SPEAKER_03]: to be comfortable with the composition of
the product and sort of the recycling
[SPEAKER_03]: process overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is kind of the guidance that we
give.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think a little separately about the root
ball versus the stocks and the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess when I asked the question,
I was thinking more in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product itself, like root and Regen,
not so much the material you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, the amount that you're
adding in root or even with Regen is so
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal that I don't think it would be a
huge contributing factor to the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metal uptake or analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have tested your products then and
they are passing in the various state
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, way below any levels that would be
concerning to regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll have to get that from you to be
able to have that published on the
[SPEAKER_01]: website, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk more about the research now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sorts of results, and I'll get with
Dr. Ben Higgins and talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: internal trial that he ran over Goldy
Gardens and his results separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll tack it onto this podcast at the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tell me a little bit more about the
other research that you guys did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did some work with UVM, it sounds
like, and then a few different facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to jump in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we love collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our work with the University of Vermont
was actually on primarily our Regen
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Charles mentioned, we were awarded a
National Science Foundation Small Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovative Research Grant in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as part of this grant, we were
developing different formulations of Regen
[SPEAKER_00]: and then passing them off to UVM for them
to test as a third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a very strong collaborative
relationship with Dr. Deb Nair and her
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student Noah Olson there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That research is actually under review for
publishing and a journal called Compost
[SPEAKER_00]: Science and Utilization that we hope will
be accepted very shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would love for everyone to take a
look at that if they're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with regards to route and Regen
both, we love to set up as many
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative products or projects with
growers and farmers as much as we possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there's a huge value in this kind
of third party validation and trusting
[SPEAKER_00]: expert growers to insert our products into
their processes and then give us feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: on how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charles, I don't know if you wanted to
speak with them on that.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad you gave a shout out
specifically to Dr. Deb Nair and to Noah
[SPEAKER_03]: Olson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Noah I know is an avid listener of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you said, Victoria, UVM has been a
great partner and collaborator to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generated tremendous data on Regen
quantifying not only the plant outcomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: the yield improvements that can happen
with Regen and recycling plant matter,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also in really quantifying the
microbial actions, the ecoenzyme outputs
[SPEAKER_03]: to help us really understand the
mechanisms of how these microbes are
[SPEAKER_03]: breaking down the lignin and the
cellulose, the really tough parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant matter in order to create access to
the nutrients that they contain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also had a wonderful experience
collaborating with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: great growers in Vermont, in California,
Colorado, Arizona, and have generated
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendous data.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Victoria said, we really value seeing
what Regen and Root are going to do in a
[SPEAKER_03]: live commercial cultivation environment
where there are all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_03]: variables at play.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to make sure that the product
and the science is really strong to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that you get consistent results
across all sorts of different grow types
[SPEAKER_03]: and conditions, which is very much what
we've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll mention a few specific results
that we've gotten with Root.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our customers out in California is
a grow called Floretera.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a really strong cultivating
foundation team, several different retail
[SPEAKER_03]: locations as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shared with us that when they
switched from clonex to Root, they had a
[SPEAKER_03]: really wide range of benefits associated
with that transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had been struggling significantly
with a fungal pathogen that was really
[SPEAKER_03]: giving them a lot of trouble in their
cloning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had a cloning success rate that
was way below their targets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to keep taking more cuttings from
plants that they didn't necessarily want
[SPEAKER_03]: to put into the mother plant category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, we're caught in a
really tough cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since transitioning to Root, they have
gotten their cloning success rate way
[SPEAKER_03]: above their target rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're now around a 95% success rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mind you, they're doing peak clone
times they're doing about 20,000 cuttings
[SPEAKER_03]: a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are no longer struggling with the
fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've increased their yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've set room records with plants
treated with Root.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're one of the examples that I
mentioned before in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: accelerated vegetative growth times.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been running 28 day veg cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in switching to Root, they're down to
10 day cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a massive difference in savings in
electricity and other resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been really excited to be part of
that transition and grateful to them and
[SPEAKER_03]: their meticulous data tracking to be able
to share such clear results with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, doing good science takes a
lot of focus and data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, as I said, we're grateful to
their team for all the tracking that they
[SPEAKER_03]: did to provide us with these really clear
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will have been on to talk more
about the results at Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in the interest of time,
I think I covered most of the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had for you guys, at least around
Root.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to talk a little bit about
Regen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a product that we tested
internally for some of the reasons that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you and I had had dinner together
and we talked about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: applications outside of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why don't we talk about some of the
potential uses for that product and how
[SPEAKER_01]: people are using it and what the results
might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can ask questions around that
because I have a few more about Regen
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, why don't you just go ahead and
share some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Victoria, you want me to get us started
there and you can kind of jump in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll explain the science behind it
a little bit and then maybe you can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the applications of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind Regen predominantly
centered around the fact that hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in particular have a really high
concentration of this difficult to degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule called lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for fellow science nerds out there,
lignin is very aromatic rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it forms these carbon rings that take a
lot of energy to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But behind and underneath all of that
lignin are cellulose, hemicellulose and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the nutrients that help the plant
exist and continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about breaking down
cannabis, to release those nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you first need to break through the
lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is the main molecule that we
were thinking about breaking down when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking into candidate microbes to
bring together into a Regen product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few different enzymes that can
be used to break lignin down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found quite a few microbes,
bacteria and fungi that are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce those enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the individual microbes ability
to produce those enzymes, the consortium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the various formulations that we tested
and their ability to produce those
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on all of our different
combinations, testings, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately tested like over a dozen
different formulations of Regen before we
[SPEAKER_00]: found the one that worked the best and
that we were most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we were able to hand that product off
to UVM for them to test it and some more
[SPEAKER_00]: ecoenzyme assay types of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then recycling the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we love that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very conceptually exciting to the
both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of course, in a lot of ways what got
MEO started due to that NSF grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for Charles to talk a
little bit more about the applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to echo Victoria, it is kind of
the product that we see as kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest idea, the biggest potential impact
that we can have around agriculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're of course, as an environmentally
focused company, we're very excited
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime we can eliminate a harmful
chemical and Root is certainly a product
[SPEAKER_03]: that does that and leads to better plant
outcomes while taking away what can often
[SPEAKER_03]: be a dangerous chemical input.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Regen, as you described, can be used
in an agricultural setting, can also be
[SPEAKER_03]: used in commercial cannabis cultivation or
home gardens as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywhere you've got plant residuals and
kind of a demand for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done a lot of tests comparing side
by sides with various fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_03]: various composts with and without Regen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen yield improvements for
plants treated with Regen in the range of
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 to 35% on average, including some tests
that we've done with some really strong
[SPEAKER_03]: living soil grows around the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: To your earlier point, Ted, there are sort
of some regulatory dynamics that vary from
[SPEAKER_03]: state to state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some states may be more or less open to
the idea of on-site recycling of stocks
[SPEAKER_03]: and leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the scenario where the kind of
regulations are open to on-site recycling,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have both indoor and outdoor growers
who will collect their stocks and leaves,
[SPEAKER_03]: put them in super sacks or into piles,
apply Regen to the top, mix that up a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: More mixing can lead to more complete
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not required, but it can make things
go a little faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those lignin degrading microbes tend to
like oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that recycled organic matter can then
be applied back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixed in as an amendment or used as a top
dressing, we've also found that
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly in the top dressing
application, the water consumption
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, as you know, mulch has a lot of
strong benefits for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Regen recycled biomass is an
especially nutrient and microbial rich
[SPEAKER_03]: mulch or amendment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the different applications
that we see there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've also done a lot of work on
corn farms and in forage crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: spraying Regen into the fields,
allowing those microbes to do their work
[SPEAKER_03]: to break down the residual plant matter
into nutrients for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can also be done at small scales
on leaves and backyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we're really big on this idea that
there's no such thing as plant waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Regen we see as a way for people to
recognize that and make it easy to get all
[SPEAKER_03]: the benefits back from something that in
some instances they may be paying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the idea of using it for the
silage or plant matter that's left out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fields, agricultural, to break it down
faster for the next cycle or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down a cover crop after cutting
or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do struggle with and talk to me about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recycling plant matter in and out of
facility raises the risks of pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens in controlled environment
agriculture, which is what a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now granted with living soil and such,
we do give up a little bit of control
[SPEAKER_01]: already by recognizing that there's going
to be microbes in our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be beneficial insects and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still trying to avoid pests and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does Regen impact those risks or how
do you see it playing a role in a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I answer it, I'll just say,
I think, Dad, in the way that we did with
[SPEAKER_03]: Root, we're going to have to prove it to
you with Regen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, very, very much appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To your question about pests and
pathogens, pathogens risk, we,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, recognize that that's a huge
consideration for commercial growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly, as you said, operating in an
indoor controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to generate really strong
data with UVM, both into the mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on with the microbes and also
how that translates to interactions with
[SPEAKER_03]: different pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll kind of point to the research
paper that Victoria mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will be published soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: UVM performed side by side, they performed
what's referred to as a plate competition
[SPEAKER_03]: assay, in which a pathogen is grown on a
plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you kind of do something to the
plate to see whether the growth of that
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen is impacted.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case of this experiment with UVM,
they used the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia
[SPEAKER_03]: salani, which is a particularly strong
fungal pathogen that also is used often in
[SPEAKER_03]: academic settings because, well,
one, you can grow it on a plate and also
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's sort of representative of a
bunch of different types of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in those experimental conditions,
they found that putting recycled biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: that had been treated with Regen onto that
plate with the fungal pathogen prevented
[SPEAKER_03]: that fungal pathogen from growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was full suppression of the
pathogenic growth in that context.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also mention, to your point about
pests, of course, we think about insects
[SPEAKER_03]: that we don't want running around or
flying, crawling, et cetera, around the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the particular eco-enzymes that UVM
measured is a chitinase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chitin, of course, being a component of
insect exoskeletons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Regen produces a very significant
amount of a chitinase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: NAG is the acronym.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the presence of that eco-enzyme can
serve the function of breaking down insect
[SPEAKER_03]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eggs, you know, and getting into their
exoskeletons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there are some mechanisms that
may help in reducing some of that risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something I think growers may
want to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of kind of what Victoria
talked about, this idea of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: recapturing and releasing some of these
nutrients that may be tied up in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and just less accessible due to
the lignin cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do worry about heavy metals,
pathogens, pests, and viroids now,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with hoplite and viroid as
potential concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, over time, maybe we find
with research that in a real-world
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, it's less of a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are all very real concerns to
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope we can start to address some of
them more with the work that we do at MEO
[SPEAKER_00]: on Regen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would add that like in an outdoor
situation, in a greenhouse that maybe has
[SPEAKER_01]: more exposure to outdoor air and pests and
pathogens in general, I wouldn't associate
[SPEAKER_01]: the same level of risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I think I could see a lot of
beneficial use cases in those scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate the dialogue around it
because I know it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to just have a
conversation around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least get people thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, is there anything
else you want to add about Root or Regen
[SPEAKER_01]: or the technology itself before I cut the
show and we cut to Dr. Ben to talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more about the research of gold
leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should about do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, appreciate the
opportunity to be on the podcast with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great platform that you've built
here, a great way to share a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful knowledge with growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We enjoy listening and appreciate the
expertise that's shared on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really happy to be part of the
conversation and really excited to be
[SPEAKER_03]: working with you and the team at KISS and
to be offering our products on
[SPEAKER_03]: kissfororganics.com very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you so much for giving us the
opportunity to talk more about Root and
[SPEAKER_00]: Regen and how they came to be and what
they could potentially do for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really great to talk with you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Victoria Holden and Charles
Smith.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're back this time with Dr.
Ben Higgins here to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: results using the MEO product Root over at
Gold Leaf Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, can you talk to me about how you guys
set up the experiment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it was a pretty straightforward
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used cloning domes and we do have some
other SOPs associated with our cloning
[SPEAKER_02]: normally, but because we were just really
interested in how the MEO Root performed
[SPEAKER_02]: against the kind of leading competitor,
we held off on all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was basically just a plain water
and the rooting hormone trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was pretty encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Survival rate was not significantly
better, but that was great because we were
[SPEAKER_02]: still hovering around 80 to 85%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't see a decrease in using the
MEO Root, which is something we obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: were very cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, the main thing we're
really tracking that we were able to track
[SPEAKER_02]: was clone growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just looked at clone height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we did was basically the day that
those clones went into the plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a height measurement and I
went from the base of the plant where it
[SPEAKER_02]: intersected the plug all the way up to
that apical node.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, I've started to use that kind
of as my height measurement because fan
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves can go up and down and they're
bigger or smaller depending on cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really just kind of keeping a standard
reference point, that top apical node
[SPEAKER_02]: standardized things pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went from that and then we just
basically gave them a hand watering when
[SPEAKER_02]: they needed them, a misting, left them in
a controlled environment, the dome kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: standard protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 10 days, I popped the lid off
and just wanted to get an idea of if we
[SPEAKER_02]: were seeing any better performance and
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to set this up, we always try to
conclude at least two, if not more
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of production dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had two cultivars we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was called lemon mimosa and
the second was called hat trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 10 days, we actually did find
significance in lemon mimosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The average increase in height was about
two point eight centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas for the synthetic rooting hormone,
we only had an increase of about point
[SPEAKER_02]: seven three centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a significant difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, then just to confirm, what was the
synthetic product that you were using?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were using clone X gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was rooting comparison clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so the second cultivar hat trick,
same thing, same protocol, same measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 10 days, we did not see a
standard, a significant difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, between treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mean change for Emio root was point
nine five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centimeters better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas that for clone X was point nine
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So better, but not statistically better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that we're also very excited
about was we didn't see it any worse than
[SPEAKER_02]: clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of the benchmark for us
to be willing to accept it into our
[SPEAKER_02]: program, which is as long as it held its
own or did better than we were,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were happy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just kind of the tip though.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, obviously we, I tried to get a
couple of more, what's the best way to say
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of more direct comparisons to see
how Emio root was performing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really focused on the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried weighing out the P plugs prior and
then cut the tip, cut the clone off at the
[SPEAKER_02]: base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just left with the root mass and
the P plug, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was still so much variation in
just how much moisture those P plugs held
[SPEAKER_02]: onto that I didn't feel like I could get a
very clear signal as to if the change in
[SPEAKER_02]: weight I was seeing was actually added
root mass or if it was just because that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular plug held onto more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't go with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of the serial sacrifice,
meaning that I purposely killed clones to
[SPEAKER_02]: get at that question, I wasn't able to
take as many replicates forward into
[SPEAKER_02]: production that I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we saw the really nice success
rate and the promising growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: we then did it again on two other
cultivars that are now, oh gosh,
[SPEAKER_02]: only about a week away from harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those went the full cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we'll get a really nice sense to
see if we are getting any of these early
[SPEAKER_02]: onset kind of does grow, does the
relationship between the plant and Emio,
[SPEAKER_02]: the increased in growth, does that
translate to, obviously, the thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: most growers care about, which is does it
increase bud production, bud weight,
[SPEAKER_02]: dry weight, and all that fun stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be coming within the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hypothesis, then, is that because
Emio, the root product, is a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: product, we may get some microbial
persistence that can last beyond just the
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation stage and into veg and
potentially into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get to flour faster by
shortening the veg stage, possibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also get increased yields
overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the goal there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of knock-on effects from
that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you manage to get your plants,
your clones, to a certain threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: height, whatever facility or grower feels
that, whatever that height may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you can get there faster without
obviously sacrificing anything else down
[SPEAKER_02]: the road, the big, obviously, business
side of that is you can maybe squeeze in
[SPEAKER_02]: one, maybe even two more harvests per year
because you are decreasing that veg time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could flip to flour quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could harvest quicker than maybe,
depending on your production schedule,
[SPEAKER_02]: get in a yield or a harvest or two more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that in itself obviously, if you were
to crunch the numbers, would be a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful change in production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the microbial perspective,
we want these plants to hit the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: running as fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lag between when you transplant
from a somewhat sterile or synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: environment into what we do, which is the
organic living soil, we don't know how
[SPEAKER_02]: fast it takes for those symbioses to
develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how long it takes for that
bulk flow signaling between the plant root
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates and the microbes already present
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take for them to make
that handshake?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can get that process started
earlier on, I feel like you're helping out
[SPEAKER_02]: with not having such a lag time between
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could very well easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is all stuff that,
of course, I'd love to be able to get at
[SPEAKER_02]: with a compound scope and actually see
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a tricky thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to see the plants take off a
little bit more quickly, if you do manage
[SPEAKER_02]: to get more, instead of just that one big
apical growth, if you get more branching
[SPEAKER_02]: and those things are keeping up a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other signals we're going to try
to see if this relationship between early
[SPEAKER_02]: root colonizing by organic microbial
community pays off down the road versus
[SPEAKER_02]: just a synthetic molecule that kind of
thinks makes the plant do this rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's kind of just left in a
sterile environment to then go seek out
[SPEAKER_02]: those kind of organic relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Ben, did you measure the overall
growth through veg to see if you did get
[SPEAKER_01]: increased growth in the meal plants versus
the?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the clone, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw it for that first 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the statistically different
statistically significant results that we
[SPEAKER_02]: saw for lemon mimosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't see it again in hat trick,
but we we continue to track the growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: those that pace stayed constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in fact, for lemon mimosa,
which was the one that we saw that big
[SPEAKER_02]: jump in height, Emio relative to clone X,
just by sheer randomness, the clones
[SPEAKER_02]: actually started for the the Emio
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started out a little bit shorter than
the ones did for clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after 10 days, those totally switched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had, you know, the Emio clones were
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we track that for another 10 to
12 days, you know, weekends kind of throw
[SPEAKER_02]: off production cycles a little bit for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right the next time we were able to
transplant into our beds to flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: we we took a point there and also looked
at, you know, vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_02]: performance to make sure that pattern
stayed constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't seem like it was just this
big bump and then kind of level off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It continued to rise, especially relative
to the clone X trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: That did hold true for hat trick as well
in that once they were on a growth
[SPEAKER_02]: trajectory, it didn't really change too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of lends a little bit of
credence to the whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get them jumped quickly,
they kind of take off on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, unless there's a hiccup in
nutrients or if they're running out of gas
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if everything's there and they do have
a good jump start, they tend to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to stay on that trajectory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see any fall off yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we certainly haven't seen any going
into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be very, I'm very anxious in the next
week when we bring that room down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plan there is just to take each plant
individually, weight individually,
[SPEAKER_02]: tag them individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way we'll be able to know,
like, you know, here's the overall plant
[SPEAKER_02]: height at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the wet weight for that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll track that all the way
through to dry weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have a metric at the end,
which is, you know, how much flower or
[SPEAKER_02]: jarable product did this one plant give us
relatively?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the other treatment that we did all the
way back, you know, three plus months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the main goal of this is just,
I mean, initially was just to have a,
[SPEAKER_01]: an organic option that is consistent and
can match or, you know, really just match
[SPEAKER_01]: with what we're getting with clone X and
these other, you know, synthetic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that it's, it seems to be
doing so is I would call it a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all this extra stuff with,
you know, potentially a better growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: potential disease protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things that they're,
they're starting to see, I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as a, you know,
scientist or nerd, every slice it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it opens a bunch of really interesting
questions, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously as a grower,
you want, you know, you'd love it if
[SPEAKER_02]: Hattrick had the same performance as lemon
mimosa, which was this thing just
[SPEAKER_02]: exploded, you know, relative to clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't, but I think that the thing
too, and maybe just kind of a more general
[SPEAKER_02]: thing for growers to remember is,
you know, just because you didn't get the
[SPEAKER_02]: result you were expecting, didn't,
doesn't mean you didn't get a result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, now we have this kind of
really interesting thing where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, lemon mimosa played very nicely with
Imeo and Hattrick, not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question now is very exciting,
which is, well, why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it, it, it challenges you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it focuses you to maybe think about
other aspects of your grow or what was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, was one bed mixed differently
or, you know, what, what can I control to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe help explain why we saw this result?
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're critically thinking
about unexpected results, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential for growth there, no pun
intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just something for, I think
growers to keep in mind, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if, if, if things don't go,
if your hypothesis is not supported fully,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's still a result that I think is
merited at least a couple of thoughts and
[SPEAKER_02]: a conversation as to why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in a production facility,
getting at the why and the how tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: not be the most important pathway because
it's doesn't, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily lead to additional revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all obviously a business that
we're going for here, but on occasionally
[SPEAKER_02]: the why can be more universal and then
applied to other things that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: limiting growth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep things flowing, critically
thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really, really important tool and a
lot of, a lot of benefits can come from
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing that I want to mention
before we sign off is that not every
[SPEAKER_01]: product or method or technique that we try
out, gives us a successful result.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried a lot of products over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through gold leaf and many of them
performed below what, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the state of the control was,
which is essentially what gold leaf was
[SPEAKER_01]: already doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, I think we've come a long way
and your, your initial podcast I did with
[SPEAKER_01]: you a while back showed just how much you
were able to make improvements just by
[SPEAKER_01]: running some of these trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I do want to highlight like
we've tried other microbial products in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried this one really cool sounding
Arkea product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the trial just kind of fell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried other things on the microbial
side where we just didn't get a noticeable
[SPEAKER_01]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the way I kind of couch all of
that, like, well, this worked,
[SPEAKER_02]: this didn't, you know, but it shoot,
maybe it did for another facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing to remember here is
that, you know, we, we focused very
[SPEAKER_02]: heavily on just cannabis because that's
obviously what we sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people take pictures of.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, the main species we're
targeting in all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're talking about living soil
and microbial communities, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ted, do you want to take a guess at how
many different microbial populations are
[SPEAKER_02]: in a given bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's large.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're, you're managing quite a lot of
relationships and these relationships are
[SPEAKER_02]: evolving over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put in the O root in at the beginning
of a cloning round, it's going to interact
[SPEAKER_02]: with a host of other different
populations, all given a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, one of the best ways that I've
always liked to explain this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, the two famous tennis
players, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal,
um, they're legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them, Nadal was an absolute
monster on clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where Federer wasn't just almost
unbeatable on grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when these two played each other,
their record was almost purely determined
[SPEAKER_02]: with a handful of a couple of exceptions,
but almost purely determined by the court
[SPEAKER_02]: they were playing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're on clay, Nadal would win.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're on grass, Federer would win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, they, they set this thing up
because they wanted to take the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental perspective out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made a tennis court that was half
clay and half grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put Federer on the grass and
Nadal on clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always a nice reminder to me
that when we set up these experiments and
[SPEAKER_02]: these trials that as much as we'd love to
say, this holds true for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you get lucky and that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare, but it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the species that are interacting in
your soil with the plants are all taking
[SPEAKER_02]: place in this backdrop of the environment
that they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could have the exact same genetics,
the exact same microbial populations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just put them in a different
environment and those relationships will
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some antagonistic ones might become
symbiotic or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because stuff isn't working kind of
like you were speaking to, we've tried
[SPEAKER_02]: things that haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried things that haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep trying things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as you can set aside a couple
of beds or pots to just let those little
[SPEAKER_02]: things, those little, that little subset
of your grow answer the questions that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, intrigue you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, it, there's a lot of power to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, just going back to that
tennis example, like the environment that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in really does set the stage for
how these things interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, just because a microbial product
maybe didn't work, it could very well be
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe it didn't have anything to do
with the microbial product at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that the VPD was off in the
room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it was overwatering or, you know,
so that's why replication and trying more
[SPEAKER_02]: than one cultivar, you know, these kinds
of things are really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they obviously take a lot more
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a trade off, but it's always
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the flip side, I think there's a
lot of microbial products that frankly
[SPEAKER_01]: just aren't that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's part of the reason it took
us over a year to, you know, make this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast to move forward with Emil Root was
because we wanted to make sure it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that, uh, we had some data on
ourselves in addition to the research that
[SPEAKER_01]: they shared to know that it's going to be
something that we feel good about sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: and promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the community at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that are very much into,
you know, organic processes from start to
[SPEAKER_02]: finish as we are, this, this seems to be a
really, a really great alternative to some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the more, you know, common synthetic
products that are out there, at least
[SPEAKER_02]: again, at least give it a trial and see,
you know, if it does work in your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, um, and, you know, use your own
results to, to inform if you want to scale
[SPEAKER_02]: it up or, or make any other decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime, Todd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
