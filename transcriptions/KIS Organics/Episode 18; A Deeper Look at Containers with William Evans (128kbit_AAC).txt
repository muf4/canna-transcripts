[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Cad Hussie of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday
and I'm excited to be back making podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: for 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great lineup of guests for
future interviews, ranging from the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: in lighting technology to soil testing,
permaculture, lean farming, outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast, though, is about a subject
that many people probably don't give a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought to, but it's an important
aspect of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with me today is William Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met William, actually, through Suzanne
Wainwright Evans, the entomologist from my
[SPEAKER_00]: last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were talking off air, she said,
you have to meet my husband, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about what he does and it
seemed like a perfect fit for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: William has been working in the
horticulture and nursery industry for over
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years and brings a wealth of experience
to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is not the most clamorous of
subjects, but one that deserves some
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's podcast is all about containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I've been a proponent of planting
directly into the ground when possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not an option in many situations
and propagation is best done in small
[SPEAKER_00]: tracer containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: William will share with us how containers
can dramatically reduce transplant shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: improve worker efficiency, increase plant
health, and a myriad of other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talk about how the wrong container
can cause major issues resulting in poor
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, root girdle, and even the
potential for your container being a
[SPEAKER_00]: source of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further ado though, here's our
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hello, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thanks for taking the time to do this
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk to you today about
these fertile pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a little bit of background
into how you came across the product and
[SPEAKER_00]: your history with it and then a little
more about how it's made?
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal history with it was that I was
working for a distributor that was selling
[SPEAKER_01]: them in Pennsylvania a long time ago in
another lifetime, it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertile is a French company that's been
manufacturing these pots since 1960.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's over 50 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always been manufactured on the
east side of France.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that the factory is there is
because they're made primarily of spruce
[SPEAKER_01]: fibers and the forests in the area there
have a lot of spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the factory is competing with
companies that are making firewood and
[SPEAKER_01]: timber and pulp paper and things like that
and they buy the logs from the local
[SPEAKER_01]: woodcutters and then process them there
and make them into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pots are made of spruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other ingredients in the
containers themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a little bit of peat,
about 20% or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fluctuates a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's 3 to 4% limestone that's in
there to buffer the pH of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new version of these that's
being introduced which is a peat-free pot
[SPEAKER_01]: which is 100% wood fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different blends of wood
fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's primarily spruce fiber and
there's some maritime pine in there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's all wood fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably easier to refer to them
as a wood fiber pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these pots are 100% biodegradable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing synthetic in there
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're approved for use in organic
production too, I believe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both versions are armory listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Organic Materials Review Institute
that's in Eugene, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put you through a pretty rigorous
process of examining where your raw
[SPEAKER_01]: materials come from, how they're sourced,
how you process them, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to be able to get an armory
listing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Armory listings will certify that you are
approved for use in the National Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Program run by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily mean that your
product is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that your product is approved for
use in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big distinction between an input
and an output as far as the USDA is
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertile pot would be considered an input
and it must be approved for use in
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that can be outputs are
actually something that is grown or
[SPEAKER_01]: produced from plant or animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our soil, for example, I'm working on
getting it approved for use in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually be certified organic for
the reasons that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a bureaucratic labeling issue
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be approved for use in
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go through the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're dealing with that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into some of the
differences between fertile pots and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other types of containers,
can we talk a little about what the main
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the main benefit to fertile pot is
really the porosity of the wall of the
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to help you understand why that's
important is that when you plant something
[SPEAKER_01]: in this pot, whether you put it in from a
plug or you put it in from a seed or a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting, however you start, when the roots
go through the soil that's in the pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: they reach the edge of the pot,
because the wall of the pot is about 85%
[SPEAKER_01]: porous, the roots are going to pass
straight through straight away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pot wall is so porous that we don't
even put drain holes in the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't cut drain holes into the pots
because we don't need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why that's important is because it's
going to develop a natural root structure
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to allow the roots to
develop as if they were in the native
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage to them going through the
pot is that as they penetrate the pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: they encounter air, you're going to get
root pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the air is basically stunting the
apical dominance or the desire of the root
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And preventing it from growing forward,
the root naturally forces lateral
[SPEAKER_01]: branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like if you say you had a basil
plant and you pinched the top of the basil
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you're stunting the apical
dominance of that basil plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the result of it is it branches out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a bushier basil plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing happens with the root
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the roots are penetrating the wall
of the pot, air is doing the pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically stunting the apical
dominance and it's forcing the roots to
[SPEAKER_01]: branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, the tip of the root is the
only point that actually does any work on
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the nutrients are uptake and
the moisture is uptaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have more root tips in response
to the pruning process, you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: things with a fertile pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a natural structure because it's
not being containerized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not turning inside a plastic wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have an enhanced natural root
structure because of the pruning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a better ability of that plant
to uptake nutrients and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take that pot and you put it
into the next large container or into the
[SPEAKER_01]: native landscape as you're transplanting
it, all the apical dominance that's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of those roots that were on the
outside of the pot will return and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will grow faster into that next
larger container or into the native
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape because of the fact of the type
of root structure that it's got behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a lot of photos online or in
forums and you see people showing off the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of their plants and the roots are
starting to wrap around the inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what essentially you're talking about
here is by having that root stop growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and starting a new tip, we're actually
increasing the fertility of that plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: its ability to take up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're increasing the ability for it to
uptake nutrients and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these photos that you see where
they show massive amounts of roots
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping around, that's actually really a
bad thing because two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that the energy of the plant is
being forced into apically dominant roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really, again, the tip of the roots,
the only important point of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all the rest of the roots just
carrying the nutrients and moisture up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a wrapped around,
if they're encountering a solid wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're encountering a plastic wall or
a pot that needs drain holes cut into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to turn and they're going to
circle and that's going to set up a
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern that's very difficult for the
plant to break out of when you put it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the next larger container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why oftentimes you'll get
directions when you get a plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, well, pull it out of the
plastic pot and take a knife and score the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that you're trying to score
the roots is you're trying to break that
[SPEAKER_01]: containerized structure that's been set up
by the plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course you realize that's damage to
the root structure that's setting the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, the plant's going to
survive when you plant it, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to thrive because the roots have to
regenerate and form into something that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be used by the plant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, apically dominant roots are
really a bad thing and a lot of people get
[SPEAKER_01]: them confused with good root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, growing up with my parents
owning a retail nursery, 20 years ago he
[SPEAKER_00]: was teaching me how to transplant the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process involved essentially
taking a root bound plant and really
[SPEAKER_00]: ripping the roots apart very aggressively
with a knife, with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't do that, that plant
would stay in the shape of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I took a traditional plant grown
in a plastic container and didn't break up
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots that were root bound and
planted that plant, it would eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: die anyway because the roots aren't able
to break out of that shape and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out into the other, you know,
the natural soil or native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In extreme conditions, it's called root
girdling where the roots that have set up
[SPEAKER_01]: in this containerized structure,
as they grow and they get bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get fatter and fatter and eventually
they actually choke each other off so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you really, it's like a choke hold that's
created by the plant on itself due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: shape of the root structure that you put
into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, yeah, your dad would tell you
to, you know, tear the bottom open and
[SPEAKER_01]: pull these roots apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you can imagine how much
stress that is on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it be nicer to just take the
entire good root structure with a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: root structure and enhance the natural
root structure and put it right into the
[SPEAKER_01]: next container and let it continue
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't even know that it's been
transplanted because it really hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, quote unquote
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been given a little more room to
grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so when I first heard about root
pruning or air pruning, as I've also heard
[SPEAKER_00]: it called, was through smart pots or
fabric containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've started, we started using
fabric containers, only selling fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: containers in our garden center,
but they felt like an incomplete solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, for a few reasons, one of them
being is that they're very challenging to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant out of trying to peel back the
fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever done it, it's a real pain
and try to pull the plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of being able to just
transplant the plant right into the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: and not have to worry about that
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, knowing it's going to break down
was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you're pulling a plant out of a
plastic pot or peeling back a fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapper, you're breaking the little tips
that are always at the edge there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at the very, very end of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to cause transplant
shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, of course, with something that
doesn't biodegrade, you have to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: that because otherwise it'll stay there
forever and ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the fertile pot, you're just planting
it in the ground, giving it a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: room to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is no transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as labor goes in doing that,
one of our biggest markets is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape companies that are installing
large plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's generally about a 30% labor
savings in terms of the labor costs of
[SPEAKER_01]: installing using fertile pot versus
something that's coming out of a plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: pot or a pot that you're going to have to
manipulate in some way before you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into the ground because you're just
putting the pot right into the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the soil on it and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no removing the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cleaning up at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no going to the dump at the end of
the day and, you know, dropping off
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands of plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just from a labor perspective,
there's an advantage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think another big advantage,
too, is the amount of education it
[SPEAKER_00]: requires to plant a plant or properly
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent a lot of time teaching staff
how I want our plants transplant around
[SPEAKER_00]: the nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would involve, you know,
breaking up the roots and going through
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole process, not having the plant
out of the container before it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for very long and being able to
transplant with a biodegradable pot where
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have to necessarily be the
optimal transplant time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant hasn't filled that container,
I'm not having to worry about removing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and having all the soil fall apart because
there's not enough root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't also, on the same note,
have to worry about it being root bound
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go to transplant it and,
like you mentioned, having to break apart
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the root pruning will allow you to a
bigger window of opportunity in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: when you actually have to transplant
because you're not going to get that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as you said, container bound
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that you do need to be aware of
when you plant a fertile pot, generally
[SPEAKER_01]: with any plant, you want to plant at the
same grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bury the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to leave it, you know,
raised up really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, what can happen with a
fertile pot if you've filled it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you plant it in there and you've
grown it and the soil may have compacted
[SPEAKER_01]: over the growing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with like a lip that's
sticking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to plant that so deep that
the lip is completely buried.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to plant it at grade
and then just simply tear off the lip
[SPEAKER_01]: because remember, the fertile pot is going
to be very soft at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost have to consider it really more
of a future root ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to handle it a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, grabbing it by the lip,
you might tear that lip off because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you picked it up like a glass
of water, it's very easy to move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are some of the considerations
that you'll have to be aware of when using
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile pot versus, say, a plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of these
differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said, I was familiar with
fabric pots prior to learning about these
[SPEAKER_00]: fertile pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the challenges I found was I
have an actual article on my blog about
[SPEAKER_00]: some independent testing that was shared
with me regarding the heavy metal content
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of these fabric pots coming out of
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do worry about the even with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anything on molded plastic
pots, but I do worry about people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: edible crops in some of these potential
containers because, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out in the summer in 90 degree
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those pots have BPA or other things
that can break down at high temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one thing to be concerned
about with fabric or plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another potential issue there is root
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume the fertile pot would be better
at reducing the heat compared to a black
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic pot on a hot summer day,
or is that a factor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be better at reducing the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's also going to dry out a lot
faster than a plastic pot because remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire pot, again, you have to think
of this as a future root ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dealing with a way of holding soil
in shape while the plants develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots penetrate the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant and the pot become one and there
is no way to remove the pot at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also going to trans evaporate
across the entire surface of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it works well, say in
sub-irrigation systems where you put the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot in a small low bath of water and it
will wick up like a sponge, the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: is also true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have to be careful about keeping
the pots moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to let them just sit in the
hot sun and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like your dad told you, don't let the
pots, don't when you pull a plant out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic pot, don't sit it out in the sun
for a couple hours before you plant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to consider the fertile pot as
something that's been out of the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't always think about that,
but yeah, I did notice with my fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, I do have to water more frequently
than in plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would give you the pluses and the
minuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's advantages and
disadvantages to every system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so another thing regarding these
fertile pots is you do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impact of shipping them,
the fossil fuel cost of getting them here
[SPEAKER_00]: from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively speaking, I still think that
that environmental impact is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: less than that of a fabric container or
especially a plastic container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now at my nursery,
I have these giant one and two yard totes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just full of old containers that
I've had people drop them off at our
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no one wants them because a lot of
commercial operations won't reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: containers because of the potential for
pathogens and disease and the cost and
[SPEAKER_00]: labor to sanitize these containers is just
not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to stop having to take
these containers in and store them on my
[SPEAKER_00]: property and then potentially also have to
take them to the dump and add more plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: back into our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I think they still have
less of an environmental impact even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they are coming all the way from
France.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can give you a couple of little
points that I mean, well, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of the shipping is on water,
which is a relatively low carbon impact in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of pounds of carbon per mile,
if you will, compared to, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: trucking, which is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the neat things about the way
Fertile produces these pots is that they
[SPEAKER_01]: use hydroelectric energy that's produced
from the creek, from the stream that is
[SPEAKER_01]: next to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three generating stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the electricity that's used in
the process is completely renewable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forests that they harvest the trees
from are non-GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO is not permitted in France,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no clear-cutting permitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must plant with at least,
I think it's five or six species of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be a little off on the numbers
here, but it's quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not allowed to use heavy
machinery in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a very different way of
foresting than, say, in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have just massive tracts of land
that are clear-cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see that at all in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been actively managing this forest
that the wood is cut from for over 400
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, they cut down everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the King of France decreed that
there's going to be no more of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you don't see this kind
of clear-cut and slash logging in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing directions a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned that you can get some
mold on these containers over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what we're talking about is
saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saprophytes are an opportunistic fungus
that will feed on dead and decaying
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fertile pot itself is sterile when
it's produced because the temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: that the pot is basically baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like making a paper mache
where the wood is ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's put into a slurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a screen or sieve that dips into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A vacuum is formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It draws enough wood up onto the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That screen goes into an oven for about 45
to 50 minutes where it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 300-something degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can live through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no pathogens at all alive on the
pots when they're delivered to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in your greenhouse, you might
have saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's likely you have saprophytes
floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a natural part of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes healthy soil to have
saprophytes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody says, well, I'm getting
mold on my pots, and your pots are causing
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem, it's not the pots that are the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really dirty greenhouses that are
causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't like to hear that,
but usually the answer that I give to them
[SPEAKER_01]: is, do you still have some in the box?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, take some, bring them home,
put them on your shelf in the kitchen and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow some there and tell me if you get the
same fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is almost every single time,
no, I don't get the same fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of sanitation in the
greenhouse as far as the saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, saprophytes are not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually a good thing for soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are unsightly, and for
people who are trying to grow a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: product, that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pot will support life because it is
biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the definition of biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be able to support life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a saprophytes floating
around in the greenhouse, it's possible
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get mold or fungus growing on
there, and sanitation is the key to
[SPEAKER_01]: solving that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's important for people to
realize that not all microbes are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're actually good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of them are very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of a natural, healthy soil
structure is to have mold and fungus in
[SPEAKER_01]: there that are creating a vibrant
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now when I first found out about
this, I was super excited and I thought my
[SPEAKER_00]: natural progression would be a two by two
inch cube, or maybe starting at a four
[SPEAKER_00]: inch with our veggie starts, and then
going into possibly a one gallon and then
[SPEAKER_00]: up to a five gallon, and then we started
talking a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you made it clear to me that these
pots only go up to a certain size for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started thinking about it,
it made sense because they do biodegrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have mother plants or larger
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the largest size that's really
feasible with a fertile pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest size that's really feasible
with a fertile pot is about a five inch
[SPEAKER_01]: round pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do actually make one that's a little
bit bigger than that, but it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to manage because the weight of
the wet soil in there compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface area of the pot, it's so heavy
that it's very difficult to move them
[SPEAKER_01]: around without breaking them quickly and
then becoming a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So realistically, about a five inch pot is
about the largest size that you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting things,
one of our biggest markets is grape
[SPEAKER_01]: production for wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many, many years ago, everyone
thought, well, we want a bigger pot for a
[SPEAKER_01]: better plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually have a pot that is about
four inches in square and about maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: seven or eight inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the standard for a lot of
grape plants for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody decided, well,
you've got a pot that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about maybe three inches wide and
about oh, four inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started using them and they realized
that they were able to get a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the type of root structure,
remember we're setting up the natural root
[SPEAKER_01]: structure with the enhanced air pruning
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually able to get to fruiting
and flowering in the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they were with a larger pot going
into the field before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suddenly these guys all switched to a,
well, it's a seven by nine centimeter pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became the standard for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody got the great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at your pot that's even a
little bit smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now the main standard for the
grape industry is a five centimeter by
[SPEAKER_01]: nine centimeter pot, which is about two
inches or so by about three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been able to put many more
pots into the greenhouse and be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to a fruit production in the field in
the same amount of time, but increase
[SPEAKER_01]: their output tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a larger container is not necessarily
going to be more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that doesn't take.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases it can be a problem because
if you've got, now when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting, if you're going into less
than, if you're transplanting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, let's say, you're going into less
than desirable soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a very large pot and you put
that into the hole, and you're going from
[SPEAKER_01]: a really nice peat moss mix or what other
substrate you're using, the roots tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: not want to explore into less than
desirable soil conditions out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why having the smaller pot
forces the roots out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you've got the fertile
pot where the roots are on the outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot and they're in contact,
they generally tend to explore into that
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding soil a lot faster than
something that's got a lot more soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: it can use up in a really comfortable
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smaller pot doesn't take into
account the fertility system involved or
[SPEAKER_00]: the fertigation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume in a smaller container
you're probably fertilizing a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently for these grape growers because
there's less fertilizer in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're using less media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's the same amount of fertility
needed per cubic inch of plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you're necessarily
increasing your rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be maybe applying a little
bit more frequently because you have less
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that holds the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're liquid irrigating or liquid
feeding, you might be using a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the amount of time,
the number of cycles that you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fertility should be about the same
between a larger plant and a smaller plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the amount of fertilizers
you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're able to reduce the size of the
container relative to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce the size of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase the output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase the output of your greenhouse per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, the greenhouse has an
overhead cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs so many dollars per square foot
to run that place, whether you have one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in there or 10,000 plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you can divide the overhead
operating costs across more plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is even more of an issue
with cannabis because a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: using artificial lighting, which costs
even more money from an electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and energy perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to create that canopy with
less square footage, I think, is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the question is going to be,
can you get to fruiting and flowering with
[SPEAKER_01]: the grapes is what I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't speak to cannabis with any
degree of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be a question of,
do you get to flowering in the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of time where you can actually harvest
with more plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing you mentioned, too,
was going from different types of media
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have a really good potting soil
inside your container and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior soil is not of the same quality
and the roots won't want to push out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that in a traditional landscape
because we're taking fruit trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that are grown in really good
soil that we're then putting out into a
[SPEAKER_00]: ground where we don't always know the
fertility or the quality of the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: the homeowner has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for cannabis, most people are going
from potting soil to potting soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not that difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if in a situation, say you had an
outdoor greenhouse where the soil quality
[SPEAKER_00]: was not quite the same as the potting
soil, then I could see where this
[SPEAKER_00]: container size might come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what we like to do is take some good
compost or a portion of that potting soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and mix it in with the native soils
around, I guess in this case, it would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be around your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, we would do it around in
the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dig the hole twice the size of our root
ball and then mix that in so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots will want to reach out past that
original shape they were in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it's important to have the
roots on the outside of the pot like you
[SPEAKER_01]: do with the Fertile Pot so they're already
in contact with that right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to just stay in this nice
little home that they've got right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're finding in
terms of transplanting there is the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: who are doing sun-grown hemp production
seem to be experiencing some success with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Fertile Pots because they're going
into the soil outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going into a another larger pot
with really nice compost in there might
[SPEAKER_01]: not make as much of a difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, we're using this to put it
in terms that most growers are used to is
[SPEAKER_00]: we would use them for our seed trays,
for maybe a traditional four inch
[SPEAKER_00]: container, and then up to about a one
gallon or a number one sized container is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the largest size Fertile Pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really a propagation company.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the five inches, the largest are 12
centimeters, the largest that we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: right now that's realistically feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not somebody who's going to be
providing you with three and five and 15
[SPEAKER_01]: and 25 gallon containers after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not possible with a biodegradable
container like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really meant for getting it started
in the greenhouse, going from a seed or a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing that I kind of wanted
to bring up is we are propagation and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce a tremendous root structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can produce a natural root structure,
but it depends on what you bring to the
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are starting into a Fertile Pot
with a seed or with a cutting or a clone
[SPEAKER_01]: or even a plug, something that's coming
out of a really good plug system that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been moved right on time or an alley pot
or some of these other, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for these and these kind of plug systems,
it will perform very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you bring to the party an overgrown
plug that is wrapped up and in a
[SPEAKER_01]: containerized structure, I can't undo that
with the Fertile Pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important that you start from the
beginning and get your root structure
[SPEAKER_01]: right from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you compromise that root
structure with any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: containerization, there is no system
that's going to be able to undo that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea here is just minimizing
transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep the plant as happy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not adding on any delays in terms
of our overall plant cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned some of these other
containers or propagation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we touch on the differences between
Fertile Pot and the pros and cons of like
[SPEAKER_00]: soil blocks, oasis cubes, peat pots,
rapid rooters, some of these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are more familiar with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of systems out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's absolutely amazing the
ingenuity that people have had over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years in trying to produce propagation
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which particular one do you want to
tackle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start with an easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil blocks was one that I had never heard
of until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my employees mentioned that on her
tiny farm she uses these things that make
[SPEAKER_00]: little blocks of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there actually isn't a container around
her plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an initial thought on that,
but I'll go ahead and let you speak to it
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like if you were a kid and
you had a little, you're building a
[SPEAKER_01]: sandcastle at the beach and you've got a
mold that's shaped like a brick and you
[SPEAKER_01]: pack the sand in there and then you pull
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with the soil block is that
you're compressing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're reducing the air ratio in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the availability of oxygen is really
the number one factor in determining
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not roots are going to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to have a substrate that
allows for good aeration in there and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you compress something, you're limiting
those air spaces and making it harder for
[SPEAKER_01]: roots to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was my concern was compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that in a lot of small organic
operations, especially in the northeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have never ever seen that in any
serious commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk to you about peat pots
because I have used those in the past with
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and seedlings and I've seen them in
Home Depot for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big difference there between a
fertile pot and a peat pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways you can tell the
difference between a fertile pot and a
[SPEAKER_01]: peat pot is look at the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a drain hole cut into it,
then it's a peat pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no drain holes cut into it,
then it's a fertile pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that the peat pots are using
the drain holes cut into them is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the wall of the pot is not porous enough
to allow the air, the roots, and the water
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass easily through the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they cut a drain hole into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, by extension, you can see that
as the roots reach the edge of that pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to pass through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to turn inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as the pot breaks down, you will
start to get roots passing through the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewall of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into the box stores and you look
at some of the vegetable plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: offered in peat pots, you'll see on the
instructions, it says to tear the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pot off before you plant it in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a simple reason for that because
they want the roots to be in contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, and the pot is not going to
break down on its own as easily in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a fertile pot, we do not recommend
tearing the bottom of the pot off.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, we don't recommend
doing anything except putting it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or the next large container.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about oasis cubes or rapid rooters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two really common ones I see in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a synthetic or artificial medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one looks like it's
rubber-based, so I assume glues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on those real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: The oasis has got some advantages in that
it's extremely consistent material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a really high
media-to-air ratio in there, but it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: completely devoid of any organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no cation exchange with oasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are growing with oasis,
it's a very technical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow a good plant with that for
sure, but you have to be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very careful about making sure that your
fertility is dead-on and it's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there are some advantages and
disadvantages to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using a fertile pot or when
you're using any kind of organic media,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a good cation exchange,
you're going to have the ability for that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to hold and release nutrients to the
plant as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more forgiving than foam
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rubber glue plugs or the rubber dirt
is another interesting product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's media that's mixed with a glue and
then poured into trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it in things like Performa and
I guess Rapid Rooter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly familiar with that one,
but if it's a glue plug, it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit to those is that as the roots
develop, they don't reach the edge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cell that they're in yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still pull the whole thing and the
plug will stay together because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: glue that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they're available in
organic or not, but the idea with the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile pot is that everything in there is
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no glues, there's no binders
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any comments on rockwool cubes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwool cubes, again, it's a mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe it's approved for use in
organics at the moment, although that
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be changing all the time,
so check back with Omri on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively expensive compared to a media
in there and then impossible to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the story because it doesn't
break down and you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it away in a landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I had on my list was arrow
cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people using those and then
going into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that challenge was always trying
to be delicate to the roots and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: planted correctly without damaging the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always seem to get transplant chalk when
going from an arrow cloner into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I can't speak to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do my homework on what an arrow
cloner was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a misting system,
so the roots are just sitting in air and
[SPEAKER_00]: then being continually misted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can picture a giant rubber-made tote
with holes in the top and then there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponic or misting system underneath
that the roots are exposed to so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put a nutrient solution or some sort of
cloning solution into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to be water roots that's
relying exclusively on taking up the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients from the moisture there that's
in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making that transition to terrestrial
roots is difficult sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you're getting the transplant
chalk there if you're trying to go into a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably continue to grow and go
into hydroponics systems and it would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably do well, but the transition
between water roots to terrestrial roots
[SPEAKER_01]: is a difficult one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little easier to go the other way
from terrestrial to water roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you'll see with the Fertile
Pot, a lot of people will start with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very small plug like a 72 cell
that's one of our strips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start them, they'll grow them,
lettuce and other kind of herbs that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take those and they'll transplant
those plugs into floating rafts and the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots will then continue to grow down
through and into the nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_01]: tank underneath and the water roots will
develop from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more difficult to go the
other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of media are people using
typically in your containers or does it
[SPEAKER_00]: vary across the board?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all across the board depending upon
what they personally think is the best one
[SPEAKER_01]: for their crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of people are using a
soil-less peat-like base mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of coir is now being incorporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of different formulas
that are out there, but you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever formula you want into the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not restricted to one sort of
substrate or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love encouraging people on this podcast
to look outside of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for products, nutrients, information in
general and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little more about some
of the applications that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: with these containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they've been around for a long
time now with the grape industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grape industry has been one of our
biggest customers for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do just massive, massive numbers in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do very large numbers in California,
some in New York here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grape industry has been a reliable
customer for us for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other industries that we do
very, very well with is breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are experimenting and trying to
grow the perfect crop in their seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they might be doing GMO stuff,
but they'll buy a million pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll plant up and they'll grow a
million different seedlings and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: select out of that 50 that they're going
to carry on from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The remaining leftovers they want to get
rid of and they don't want anybody to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that genetic information, so they compost
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The composting process destroys the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The composting process destroys all the
genetic information, so there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to remove and clean up a
million pots at the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just put them in the compost pile and
turn them into windrows from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of our customers are normal
nurseries and greenhouses that are
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating to grow on for something
that's going to be a finished product
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can probably only talk about containers
for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that I was pleasantly surprised
with the pricing associated with these
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm positive that between the reduction in
transplant shock and the ability to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger window to transplants and the labor
savings of not having to remove the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and transplant in a more traditional
method is going to more than pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves regardless of your opinions on
the ecological and environmental impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to incorporate these
into our processes at our nursery and
[SPEAKER_00]: start working with more of these larger
cultivation facilities or even smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: medical or home grows that want to switch
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking pennies on a lot of these
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our customers are really
environmentally conscious and we check all
[SPEAKER_01]: the boxes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a terrific product from an
environmental standpoint of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the majority of our commercial
customers are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're conscious about pennies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we also shine there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge proponent of organics,
but I try not to push that too hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: people because it can be off-putting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love products or methods that just
happen to be organic, but they make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: economically to where even if you didn't
care about the environment or your
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological impact, you're still going to
want to use this product or you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want to use this methodology
because it's going to save you money and
[SPEAKER_00]: time and grow a better plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I wanted to say was when
people are asking me about how long does
[SPEAKER_01]: it take to break down in the soil,
this is a question that I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: My smart-aleck answer is it doesn't matter
because the pot is porous and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stopping air, roots, or water
from moving back and forth over that
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer answer is it really depends on
the microbial action and where you are
[SPEAKER_01]: located.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Antarctica, it's going to
probably take a long time to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep it dry, it'll last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's moist and wet, it's going to break
down faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the smart-aleck answer is it
doesn't matter because the plant is just
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as if the pot never existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, for most people in North
America, about a year or so, you won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to find any evidence of this pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does bring up a storage thing that
you and I talked about off-air was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to store these containers in a
dry location so they're not getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with moisture, which can cause the
microbes to break them down faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mice and rats may potentially chew on them
if you had them, say, just sitting outside
[SPEAKER_00]: in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my barn here, I have many, many boxes
of fertile pots that are for samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are many years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, I'm sending out enough
samples that they're turning over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's like a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep it dry, like it is in the
library, it'll stay for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you let them get wet,
they'll break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did have a problem when we first
moved here and put the pots in the barn
[SPEAKER_01]: that the mice were eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to share fertile pots with the
mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they only want to eat right up
the stack, and they take one little
[SPEAKER_01]: half-moon out of the top of every pot as
it goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got cats, and that solved our
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to switch gears a little bit
because one of the things besides this
[SPEAKER_00]: product is you haven't another product
that's more specific for gardeners and not
[SPEAKER_00]: so much cannabis, but I do feel that a lot
of people that are growing cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: also interested in growing their own
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, as a vegetable gardener,
I was really excited, and I can't wait to
[SPEAKER_00]: try this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been reading about it online,
and I know I have a sample coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this product is for dealing with
slugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Slug Gone Wool Pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out of the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for quite a while now,
but realistically, as Slug Gone Wool
[SPEAKER_01]: Pellets, it's been on the market for about
10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is, it's pelletized waste wool
that you put around a plant, and when it
[SPEAKER_01]: swells up and it felts together,
it forms a barrier that slugs and snails
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to cross over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neat thing about it is that it's a
season-long barrier because it takes so
[SPEAKER_01]: long for it to break down that it'll stay
efficacious for 8 to 14 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that this works is you have a
sheep, and when you shear the sheep,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the raw fleece, which has all of
the stuff that has the good fibers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: lanolin, but it also has a lot of sweat
and poo and dirt and other things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take it to a scouring facility,
they take all of the good fibers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: lanolin out, and then what's left over is
called shoddy, which is basically what it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get rid of it, what they would
do is they would throw it onto the fields
[SPEAKER_01]: next to these scouring facilities where
they were growing rhubarb just to dispose
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would turn it in, and they began to
notice that in these fields, they were not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting any slug or snail damage,
where in the fields where they were not
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the shoddy into, they were getting
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: They began to figure out what's going on
here is that slugs and snails have a mucus
[SPEAKER_01]: foot that is easily irritated by anything
that's scratchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fibers of wool have little hooks and
barbs in it that allow it to felt together
[SPEAKER_01]: to form a fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also makes it scratchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the slug or snail tries to crawl over
this wool product here, they find it
[SPEAKER_01]: irritating to their mucus foot,
and they choose to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a barrier that prevents them from
reaching the plant that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also acts as a moisture wick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's acting as a wick that's pulling the
moisture out of the slug's foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like to be scratched,
and they don't like to be dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some other benefits to it
besides the fact that it's going to keep a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant protected for eight to 14 months
from slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a moisture mulch, because as you
put this down, the pellets swell up to
[SPEAKER_01]: about three times their size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lock together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They form this mat that the water can
penetrate through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rain will penetrate down through,
but it doesn't evaporate out from
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath, so it keeps the soil a little
moisture around the plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it does rain, or when you have high
winds or whatever, it's not going to blow
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts very much the same way that
diatomaceous earth does in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: forming a barrier, but it doesn't wash
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't blow away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to reapply after every
single rain like you do with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: iron sulfate products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a weed barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be like the Ginsu knife guy
here for a second, but wait, there's more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weed barrier because it sets up
this mat that the seeds can't come up
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weeds don't want to come up through,
and seeds that land on top of it because,
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, it's wicking the moisture away
from the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The surface is very dry, so seeds that
land on top are less likely to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteer because there's not a lot of
available moisture on the surface of this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a, but wait, there's more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thermal barrier because wool has
thermal properties, so during the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will keep the soil a little cooler
around that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll also keep the soil a little warmer
on the shoulder seasons underneath,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can extend your growing season to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the story, basically,
it's organic matter that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: biodegrading and adding organic matter to
your soil to increase the health of your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting any nutrition or nutrients
out of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is where I get into a little
bit of a pickle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the label in the UK, the label says,
contains slow-release nutrients because it
[SPEAKER_01]: is organic matter, so there is technically
some fertility to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in the United States,
if you claim any kind of fertility,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are a fertilizer, and you have to get
DEP registration in every single state
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to sell your product in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just not feasible for us,
so the easier thing in the US label,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does not say anything about nutrition
on there because nobody's going to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: this as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not really effective as a
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easier thing was to say, for the US,
we're not going to make any claims
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever about fertility, at least in
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can apply fertilizer over the top of it
that would solubilize water down through
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply fertilizer over the top of
it that will solubilize and will go
[SPEAKER_01]: through, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're using slow-release
materials, it might act as a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely going to have to have
enough water to flush it down through
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to talk about was,
prior to learning about this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were four options that I had for
organic gardeners that were dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was Sluggo, which I believe
is iron phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by a large corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if it's Dow or Monsanto,
one of those large ag companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I try not to support when I can help
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was using, and I didn't love
the idea of adding an iron phosphate-based
[SPEAKER_00]: product to my soils consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help control slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, the next option would
have been beer traps or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lot of work to set up and
maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, I would rather drink the beer than
give it to my slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option was going out there at
night with your clippers and just manually
[SPEAKER_00]: chopping them up as you see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get every one,
but you can help keep them under control
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last option was another barrier
option, which was copper tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you talked about was not all
slugs that we see are actually above
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slugs do go underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the reasons that the
Sluggon wool pellets cannot be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just take a barrier and put it
all the way around your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 feet by 10 feet, let's say,
because the slugs will go under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to do with the Sluggon is
you need to put a four-inch wide barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: around the base of each plant so that as
they try to come up, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: encounter the Sluggon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a barrier product that can't
be used on a per square foot basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to touch briefly on what you're
talking about with all these other methods
[SPEAKER_01]: are basically killing the slugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slugs love them or hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are part of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you remove any link in the chain in
the ecosystem, you're creating a less than
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lizards and frogs eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do eat some of your pests out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that what we choose to do
is say, let's decide the plants you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go somewhere else and be part of
the ecosystem, but just don't eat this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant here, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slugs are a big issue here in Washington
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the weather that we have,
we have a ton of slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more frustrating than
growing a spinach plant and putting all
[SPEAKER_00]: this time into it only to come out the
next day and have it just be munched.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no coincidence that the weather in
the UK is similar to the weather in
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing about this Sluggon that we
didn't touch on yet is that it does have
[SPEAKER_00]: an odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember I was saying that the shoddy is
basically everything that's left over
[SPEAKER_01]: after you take out the long fibers,
the short fibers, the lanolin,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a pelletized product
that smells a bit like a barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your nose right up to the bag,
you can smell it through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time that we were deciding to
see whether we wanted to work with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: we took a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put it in our laundry room and we put
some Sluggon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I poured some water over it and I wanted
to see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came back and opened up my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what is that stink?
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like a barn in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Sluggon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's not meant as an interior
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when you put the Sluggon around
your plant material outside, as it dries
[SPEAKER_01]: up, within about a day or so, any of that
odor is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love the smell of the barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people hate the smell of the barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fact of life that the Sluggon will
have a slight odor to it when it's first
[SPEAKER_01]: applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within one to two days at the most,
I challenge you to be able to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: anything even if you put your nose right
up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to try this out in some
of my raised beds next season because I
[SPEAKER_00]: always hate battling slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just take them and chuck them
into the woods across my property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I can safely protect
my plants and not have to be so vigilant
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time and worry about losing my
favorite vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, this is something you'll put
down in the springtime as soon as you've
[SPEAKER_01]: determined where your plants are going to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the Sluggon around them and then
you walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to swell up on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a band about four inches wide or
so around the plant so that the slugs
[SPEAKER_01]: can't cross over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be mounted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One pellet layer thick or one pellet layer
high is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to try to do this as
judiciously as possible, you can spread
[SPEAKER_01]: your pellets around, let them swell up,
and then you can come back and see where
[SPEAKER_01]: are my holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have any holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have any gaps because slugs will
find their way through those gaps to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come back and drop a couple of
little pellets on top of the holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will then in turn swell up and
naturally felt on their own together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything but put it
down and let it swell on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stay in place there for the
entire season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not coming back every time it
rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a one-time application per season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings up one last question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you happen to be married to one of
the foremost entomologists in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the effects of this product in
terms of beneficial insects or other
[SPEAKER_00]: insects?
[SPEAKER_01]: No negative effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like putting a wool sweater around
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not any positive or negative
effect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other pest will crawl right over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stopping anything other than
something that has a mucus foot,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that can be irritated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine rubbing a piece of sandpaper on
your eyeball.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it feels like to a slug trying
to cross over this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for that imagery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's all of my questions
for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that listeners will find this
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want, I will definitely put all of
your contact information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have the slug gone and the fertile
pots available on our website as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to start working with
you on some of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was William Evans, the North American
distributor of Fertile Pots and Slug Gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can view links to these products as
well as William's website on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this podcast will help people in
considering better ways to propagate their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as well as more sustainable
solutions to plastic pots, at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've switched over our entire farm this
year and now we'll be educating our
[SPEAKER_00]: community on why our veggie starts are in
these containers instead of plastic pots
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have to put into a landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the big benefit of reducing
transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_00]: blog at www.kisorganics.com as well as
links to the data and information we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed in this episode on the podcast
