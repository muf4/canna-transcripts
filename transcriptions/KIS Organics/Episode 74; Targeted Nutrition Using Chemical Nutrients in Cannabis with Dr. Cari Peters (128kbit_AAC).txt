[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to date, I've had few guests on the
show that grow using mineral salts or
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical fertilizers, the majority of my
guests using organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because I'm big on organics and
that's the side of the industry I'm most
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is a lot of science in
recent years coming from universities and
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers using chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as a science-based podcast,
we need to cover all aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is there a lot to learn from our
fellow cultivators, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology, but I realized that chemical
nutrients are here to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are pros and cons to using
chemical nutrients as well as organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we can grow more sustainably or
use more environmentally friendly methods
[SPEAKER_01]: that reduce salts in our runoff,
then I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using nutrients that have a smaller fossil
fuel footprint, reduce runoff,
[SPEAKER_01]: contain less heavy metals, and allow us to
maximize plant health and growth is
[SPEAKER_01]: important on both sides of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something we discussed today
in greater depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Carrie Peters.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the vice president at JR Peters and
the formulator of all products and
[SPEAKER_01]: development of new fertilizer formulas
that provide crop-specific solutions to
[SPEAKER_01]: growers' nutritional issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has too many honors and accolades to
list here, but I will put them up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie has a PhD in plant sciences and a
master's of science in agronomy from the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Maryland, as well as a
bachelor's of science in biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the third generation of Peters in
the family's business, which was founded
[SPEAKER_01]: over 72 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Carrie, glad we got to connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I'm really excited to have you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, nice to connect with you, Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's start off by giving listeners
a little bit of your background so they
[SPEAKER_01]: know who they're listening to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm Dr. Carrie Peters, and I guess
my title that they're trying to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more fun and cool instead of
chemist, I'm the master crafter and
[SPEAKER_00]: formulator of Jack's Fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make fertilizers for a whole bunch
of different things all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here and we're based in Allentown,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm the formulator for this crew
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you spent some time in school studying
this sort of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch a little bit on your
academic background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the cool thing about being in a
family business is, and that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's is a family business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been, it was founded in 1947.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of grow up, just thinking that
everybody knows things about plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant nutrients and the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But turns out, you know, what you hear
from your grandparents isn't always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fact based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to school, I actually was a
biology major in for my undergrad and a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for my master's, I got my
master's in agronomy with the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with plants that accumulated
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really cool, you know,
all over this USDA kind of project was all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world and plants that hyper
accumulate nickel and cadmium and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to kind of bring it back to
things I needed to know to join my family
[SPEAKER_00]: company, my PhD is in plant nutrition from
the University of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent a lot of time with geraniums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geraniums, even though they annoy a lot of
people, they're my favorite crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I did, you know, finally get out
of school and was able to bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge back to my family company in
2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been with them ever since kind of
crafting and bringing my kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, my little influence into how
we build fertilizers under the Jack's
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you definitely have the background to
bring science to the table when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to these formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start off talking a little
bit about about your companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to touch on the heavy metal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to touch on water and some of these
other aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's start off just talking about
because this is a little bit out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: me in the sense that I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any experience growing with
mineral salts or chemical fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of your world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let me talk a little bit about some
of the, you know, sustainability aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: of mineral salts or chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is so interesting because,
you know, my whole family, you're right,
[SPEAKER_00]: like grew up in this mineral world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
in our little town here, there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: company called Rodeale who did Runner's
World and Organic Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lived right across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they always used to have these like
really cool discussions about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the beginning of the organic
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in the like 60s and 70s to,
you know, how my grandfather was moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we we are a company that truly
the majority of what we do is we blend
[SPEAKER_00]: water soluble powders and in different,
you know, ratios and concentrations in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to deliver these really soluble and
available nutrients to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make for our product that's under the
name of Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see Jax professional and
horticulture and also like specialty ag
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jax nutrients goes into cannabis
and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Jax classic line is like for
home gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't sell to like Home Depot and
Walmart and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we it's independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden centers and kind of mom and pop,
Main Street America thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all these really quality and
qualified raw materials that are these
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients salts that we take them from
like, you know, it's a global market,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting them from all over the
world and we qualify them for low heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals and the purity and solubility that
we find is our standard at Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we go about putting
together the products that we have out
[SPEAKER_00]: there under our name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to think how to approach
this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want I want to kind of have a little bit
of a debate, a friendly debate that is on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the pros and cons of organics
versus, you know, chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's there are definite
pros and cons on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to list a few and,
you know, tell me what I miss here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just thinking off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the the cons with mineral salts
are risk of over application and leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: into our groundwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cost in terms of manufacturing and
freighting and stuff to get some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salts processed and produced and
to, you know, to your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two major ones, I think of
in terms of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the ability to really craft
something exactly the way you want it in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of consistency and the ability to
replicate something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have a lot more control than
we do in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the other pros and cons
around there, at least on the on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salt side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do get this quite a bit,
because, like you said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: my world is 100 percent this mineral side
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, when we look at when you
look at delivering nutrients to a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and we we have a laboratory on site here
that we do a lot of testing of all
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, we never really asked,
like, what nutrients are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're not going to test it if you're
not using Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that does is gives a real insight
on the nutrient targets or nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that different crops grown in
all these these different environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions kind of require.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, the I think,
in my opinion, the biggest benefit is
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to hit nutrient targets exactly
with mineral raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to, you know, say we would
like a formula to deliver, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 percent of its nitrogen from a nitrate
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can exactly match that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a difference when you talk
about cons, like what you're saying is so
[SPEAKER_00]: true that some of the mineral sources out
there that are, you know, chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers are horrible quality,
like you're getting them from sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, you know, not so great things
in there as byproducts or others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious that everyone worries
about is heavy metals, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic lead, lead, cadmium, you know,
all all of those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also just, you know,
other byproducts that really the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you apply them at the wrong rate,
they do kind of take up the spaces in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, the large and small pore
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't allow for great root
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it can lead to all this
buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, you run into that quite a bit
with with choosing mineral fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when we talk about jacks,
we don't we that's why I'm saying we
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify these raw materials to be these
really pure sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if we're using a potassium store,
we would choose something like a potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, which is super and even the grade
of it is super soluble and available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, giving potassium to
the plant attached to a nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the things you can see,
but in the, you know, grocery stores of
[SPEAKER_00]: these not so great fertilizers have a
potassium source as a potassium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no plant wants to have a root zone
filled with chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you will get potassium from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also coming with this fault that
isn't great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that kind of makes sense,
you have like good mineral salts and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other aspect of that, too,
I would think in terms of sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: is not over applying these chemical
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your spent media at the end of your
grow should be fairly low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, I would expect if you want to do
this as sustainably as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the cool things that
when we work with growers and we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of like hybrid growers to that,
you know, obviously aren't like Omri
[SPEAKER_00]: listed type people, but are trying to
build a sustainability of their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're using a mixture of a mineral
and an organic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we go crop by crop and develop
these nutrient targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at, OK, you know,
I only need 30 parts per million of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're trying to deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you using this as a nutrient
amendment?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use some water soluble as like an
available kind of shot of a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, we are never we're trying
never to over apply because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: More isn't better in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be fair, I want to talk about
some of the pros and cons on the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of organics, I think the
advantages we have are that it is organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a big, big point to a lot of
people, including myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the challenges and disadvantages
are that we we can't quite hit these
[SPEAKER_01]: targets quite as exactly because nutrients
are being released over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're requiring microbial action or
process in order to become available to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, there are still some
sustainability issues depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: that nutrient is and where it's sourced
from that amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, coming some cocoa core comes
from tropical locations, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: neem, karanja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things are not locally
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that fossil fuel cost to get
it to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the advantages are that we a lot
of people are reusing their soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's something that we talk about
here that I work with a lot of growers on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't give us the same level of
consistency that you would get from you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, a mineral salt program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, you know, I just want
to be fair here in terms of the pros and
[SPEAKER_01]: cons on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I it sounds silly, but being a plant
nutritionist that I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and the chemistry side,
the like alchemy side of mixing things
[SPEAKER_00]: together to like provide nutrients to the
plant, I'm always open to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and working with growers with
these hybrid programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even just helping them understand the
nutrient profile with whatever they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the fun side of what we
do here at JR Peters because we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to really look at the crop and and
how people are growing it all different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love these heated debates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't too heated though, Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just good conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we have a lot of mutual friends and
I've heard such great stuff about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly not going to be too hard on
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I here's one, though, that might be a
little bit more contentious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always thought it was a little
arrogant of us as humans to think that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could formulate a nutrient solution for a
plant better than nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, not when it comes to yield
necessarily, but I mean, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: brings in the whole idea of steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously we can pump a plant
full of something and grow it bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is it healthier or is or is nutritious
or going to have the same terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression as you might get from,
you know, a well-managed organic grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's definitely something that
that we discuss constantly here in our
[SPEAKER_00]: like inner tech team meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are we truly missing out because
we're just so focused on these targets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we we're always,
you know, looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: other additives and things that might be
useful in enhancing a root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear what you're saying for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, unfortunately, like the fun
part of my job is being so like like
[SPEAKER_00]: intense on this mineral side that you kind
of, you know, love to hear everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still just with Jax are trying to
make sure we have the most soluble and
[SPEAKER_00]: available mineral blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does kind of put blinders on if you
know what I mean a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will admit I am jealous in your
ability to research and and do studies
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, a lot of people don't
want to touch organics in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are so many variables
involved in every growing scenario,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when we talk about soils or
living soils as people are calling them
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really hard to do research on it
compared to, you know, a chemical grow
[SPEAKER_01]: like this with an inert media or something
that's really consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that sense, I I am jealous of your
ability to do research in a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, too, like what was what,
you know, the the background of our
[SPEAKER_00]: company is mostly like especially ag and
horticulture back when it started in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 40s and 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as cannabis has really, you know,
stepped into the limelight over,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what in the illegal and legal
side of it, we've gotten to see so many
[SPEAKER_00]: more people kind of jumping into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm super excited for is now
finally, the universities are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, you know, put out some of these
research based studies and bring some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this to light a little bit more than what
what has gone on in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will help all of us
really jump into the perfect kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario in exactly what you're saying
like plant yield, plant quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the final product,
too, for hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's what excites us here at
Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we work with a lot of different
universities to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the the mineral side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't wait to see that as we move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty twenty one and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm under the impression that if
we're talking about strictly yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: that a combination of organics and
synthetics is the optimal way for for
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing and getting the highest levels
of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying this only based on my own
anecdotal evidence and what I've seen out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the giant pumpkin growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they kind of maxed out around
two thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, around a thousand pounds back
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started incorporating,
you know, some biologicals like
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungus started treating their
patches with a little bit more care from
[SPEAKER_01]: an organic perspective and along with
genetic improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is huge as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they're now up over twenty five
hundred pounds with these these pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of this hybrid method.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your experience with sort of,
you know, hybrid methods in regards to
[SPEAKER_01]: yield versus, you know, a strict organic
or mineral salt approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, this is the this is the
cool part about having the lab here
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're kind of we're really able to
work with growers doing all different
[SPEAKER_00]: things to kind of track where they
started, what amendments they're using and
[SPEAKER_00]: then match that to data to like nutrient
concentrations in the tissue and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it's it's so difficult for me
specifically to say, oh, I lean one way or
[SPEAKER_00]: another, because I I feel that people tend
to have, I don't know, their own ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to make whatever choice they decide to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones they decide to go with work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of growers using strict
mineral fertilizers, ours or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: do unbelievable yields in hemp and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, I've seen other growers
really be able to cultivate this living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, not even utilize a mineral component
at all and be able to reach very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: or exactly the same type of yield in in in
in the same varieties that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's so many factors, I think now,
Tad, that it's hard to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: say what you know, one way is better than
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hybrid approach I've found has been
really successful for most people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out in their own like home
environments or even slightly larger than
[SPEAKER_00]: that or moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say there's there are a lot
of growers we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have these multi state operations
that really are on the path to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making this as efficient as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you talked about that in the
beginning, that efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you look at how much
these inputs cost and the sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: of where you're getting them from,
that's going to be very important as this
[SPEAKER_00]: market kind of moves forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mineral side of it does have a
really low cost in use, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're talking about like how much
the powder costs versus all these liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments being shipped all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if if you're going to go with a
mineral salt, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: powdered is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can mix with their own water,
you know, shipping shipping water around
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I feel like we've covered
that pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are going to want to talk
about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've mentioned your experience with
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we start there, though,
because I, you know, I talk to people all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and that's always a challenge is,
you know, limiting arsenic, limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: cadmium, lead, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you finding these cropping up
the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the like most common sources of
contamination?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solution soil are big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other things should people be
watching for if they want to limit their
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, specifically, I see a lot of heavy
metals coming in as carrier, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts in these individual nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're adding in some
sort of nitrogen or calcium source as into
[SPEAKER_00]: your root zone, you got to watch for the
heavy metals there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we see quite often
is people are using gypsum in their root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone to try and, you know, add a soluble
calcium source that's a little longer
[SPEAKER_00]: lasting and doesn't affect the pH of the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a lot of gypsum sources having
cadmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cadmium is basically the main one,
but we've also seen arsenic and lead in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something that you don't
think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, gypsum, that's,
you know, a really nice way to get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't realize it's coming
with all of these kind of carrier terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think like we also seem to
in almost every single nutrient that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we're bringing in as a raw material from
sources all over the world, we always see
[SPEAKER_00]: some level or another of heavy metals in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people to say, oh, I'm doing stuff
that has zero heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trying to get refined material
that has the lowest amount possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what we strive at at Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole kind of QAQC qualification
process to try and keep these levels as
[SPEAKER_00]: low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine if people weren't paying
attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what worries me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, like I chose to get my soil
registered as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have heavy metal testing and
come under that same level of scrutiny as
[SPEAKER_01]: your fertilizers, because I think that's
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know of anyone else that's
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of challenges around it,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, especially on the organic
side, we know we're testing our
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, things can change batch to
batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're constantly trying to monitor
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you said gypsum, that wasn't
even really one on my radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of like rock dusts, for example,
that people are using kelp meal and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that for inputs, feather meal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's I think it's
something growers really need to be aware
[SPEAKER_01]: of and monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say you had a field that did
have, you know, you had a crop that failed
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you try and do to remove it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you have them grow a hemp crop or
some other accumulator possibly to get
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that arsenic or something into the
biomass of the plant to dispose of?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we manage things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is where hopefully we
will be able to move over the future years
[SPEAKER_00]: to come here, because the hyper
accumulator research, like we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are certain species of plants that
take up heavy metals really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do that up in at least six to
eight inches of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by planting like a crop, a cover crop
almost, and some of these are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the mustard family or
sunflower family or cabbage family and
[SPEAKER_00]: just planting a crop of those types of
plants to remove the heavy metals and we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they're excellent at cadmium,
zinc, nickel, selenium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones we know that have harder problems
are like arsenic in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know how often people are
thinking of doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a few growers that are growing
outside in these situations in areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: the of the US here that do have soils that
are extremely high and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only is it just in the root zone,
it's also like the dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if like it's dusty and you get that
dust on your plant, you can effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: fail a crop because that dust is now stuck
to your, you know, your sticky butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a real, real problem around
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's be fair that some of these
testing things are showing huge
[SPEAKER_01]: variability, I've found, in the results
that growers are getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll pass at one lab and fail at
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we obviously have variability there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the laws, I think, are a little
too stringent around this since we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really know what levels are acceptable or
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not testing our vegetables like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really crazy that cannabis has this
completely different standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I also feel like the,
the group that regulates this in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country is the American Plant Food Control
Officials that do a lot of regulating for,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, you're registering your
soils as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are definitely a smart group of
people, but they are operating on a state
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, there's just even from one state
to another, there's all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements and recommendations that,
you know, could really be useful if,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we are going to, you know, step
cannabis and, and quality products coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into our country, how it's regulated needs
to be something that's, that's on a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: level and not specific to each state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super frustrating, as I'm sure you
know, in registration to try and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of, you know, what people are asking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just, at Jax, we just try and
qualify every raw material to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest possible and, and keep that in a
non-detectable or, you know, as low as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for all of these specific heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it keeps us busy for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a similar thing in terms of
just trying to be as low as possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly trying to innovate if we find
ways to, you know, lower our, our levels
[SPEAKER_01]: even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a, it's a constant process.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do want to mention too,
is that genetics appears to play a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: big role in all of this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people need to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a lot of times where just a
portion of a crop will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously cultivar selection is huge
when it comes to this heavy metal uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it'll be kind of neat to see if
we start to really pull out these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that are the high performers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we can also, you know,
pay attention to those other traits like
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metal hyper accumulation and get
that data out for others to, so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, you know, growers are making
selections on what they want to grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want to breed themselves,
they can, you know, utilize some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: data that they have on these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not kind of like, Oh,
my friend down the street is growing this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that worked well, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will only come in time as there's
more like research kind of published and
[SPEAKER_00]: out there for us to ponder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about, you know,
using mineral salts, a lot of people on
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic side, you know, are concerned
that these salts are going to be killing
[SPEAKER_01]: off microorganisms in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're also gardening in a manner that
includes, you know, biological inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost things, you know, they're trying
to get nutrient cycling going from a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the effects of salts on you know,
on soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we get asked
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, there is a lot of
misconception out there when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about, you know, people saying,
Oh, it's salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, there's a qualification of like
good salts and bad salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, the bad salts are the
things that you, you probably think of
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium and chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're the ones that,
that can have quite a destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic in the root zone,
because the plant is needs, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement for sodium or chloride ion in
the life cycle of any plant growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's super low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where and I know you said this
in the beginning, you talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So providing nutrients to the soil in the
right concentration, so that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: available for plant uptake, and also for
soil microbe use, you know, nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: a source of food for the good things that
live in your soil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not qualifying it as Oh,
this calcium is coming from a mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: base, versus an organic base, they're
seeing that nutrient as a as a charged
[SPEAKER_00]: entity, and utilize it that way as a food
source or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a you know, slamming it down
there and bombarding things with calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, phosphorus, nitrogen,
it's just going to be like an overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do quite a bit of damage,
you know, as as what people have seen is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, killing off these wonderful
environments, because the application rate
[SPEAKER_00]: was was way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our side of things, we always try
and get people to understand the the
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of like constant liquid feeding,
which is really a low low rate and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million of a nutrient solution
that's quite a bit lower than than you
[SPEAKER_00]: would see or think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feeding that every time the every time
the plant needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting this constant low stream
of a balanced nutrition from a mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: from our mineral type source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so low levels of mineral salts are
saying are not going to necessarily cause
[SPEAKER_01]: this osmotic shock in your soil and kill
off all the microorganisms when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: applied at a proper dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to kind of follow up on that
question, how do chemical fertilizers
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with bio stimulants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say bio stimulants,
I'm talking about, you know, microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are added to the soil things
that contain, you know, bacillus subtilis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pseudomonas, trichoderma,
you know, these sorts of like specialized
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial products that they were seeing
pop up a lot more in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of neat, you know,
seeing the data behind it, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: that show that these products do have such
a benefit in building a healthy root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow the roots to kind of have this
symbiosis of like their water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic elements that are in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it comes down to it,
and you see this in the good and bad to a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad example of it is the Chesapeake Bay
nutrients, mineral salts or otherwise act
[SPEAKER_00]: as food for as a food source as an energy
source for these these in this case of
[SPEAKER_00]: these good bio stimulants in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're useful in that they're
providing a very soluble and available
[SPEAKER_00]: energy source right that they don't really
have to work for, you know, kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: bumps right into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it causes those populations to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we go back to the thing of
application rate, you overdo this even
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly, and you're going to see negative
effects quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do provide it in a way that it
is this constant energy source,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're providing like a thriving
environment for these bio stimulants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really see the positive effects of
them in your your growing environment
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, because it's like, oh,
yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to provide such a
positive benefit for the plant growth,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what are you seeing specifically with
mycorrhizal fungus?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've heard high P can cause the,
you know, reduce infection rates because
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants get what it needs directly
already from from a fertilizer source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in terms of cannabis and mycorrhizal
fungus, are you seeing any research there
[SPEAKER_01]: or any results in your programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we Jack, the Jax programs that
we put together have a very different kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of outlook on phosphorus levels and
applications than you will see kind of out
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, scrolling the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our application of phosphorus is a
targeted time and a that that is right at
[SPEAKER_00]: between the vegetative and reproductive
state where we really flood the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: with phosphorus to kind of stimulate the
change from the vegetative state to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive and then we shut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like a one little shot
boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I from what I've heard and the growers
that we work with, we haven't seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects on this, you know,
short targeted amount of phosphorus at
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have heard from other growers,
though, that if you use phosphorus at the
[SPEAKER_00]: high rates that you often will see people
saying that that cannabis does quite well
[SPEAKER_00]: with these high, you know, you see these
blossom boosters of like 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: available P2O5 that that it has had a
negative effect for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the infection rates of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things with our our the
research that we do here is we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: done any trials ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working with growers and hearing
their recommendations and and the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: and negative that they've been kind of
able to reflect with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our way of going about phosphorus is
is quite different than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of feedback to that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be using like a blossom booster
all through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, no, you use it for a five
to seven day period, potentially 10 day
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it with the JAKS program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm convinced that in general,
growers still are over applying
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, though it's gotten better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was this idea that plants need
nitrogen and veg and phosphorus and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potassium at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that a lot all the time,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm convinced it's really potassium that's
it's leading to a lot of the yield
[SPEAKER_01]: increases that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're the plant nutrient or
nutritionist here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to me that potassium is a
much more important element when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, finishing versus these BK
boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the P is really doing a whole
heck of a lot at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I want to ask you about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at your formulations right
now on your website and you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: these very specific ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about,
you know, why and how you came up with
[SPEAKER_01]: these formulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is something we can apply to
organics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can take some of these and,
you know, try and hit targets closer to
[SPEAKER_01]: them based on the research that's being
done by companies and people like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you you hit it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times when I'm building
formulas for cannabis or other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about making sure we have those
balanced ratios in between nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium or phosphorus or calcium and
magnesium and sulfur or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron to manganese and then zinc,
boron and copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We specifically pay attention to the
ratios between that when we're building
[SPEAKER_00]: for specific crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super important for the way we set up
our Jax nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we started developing these formulas
in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people have used our
version of Jax or Peters fertilizer before
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use all different formulas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would look at it and go,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would specifically use triple 20,
20, 20, 20 in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blossom booster, 10,
30, 20, all through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they would use this old school one,
which is called variegated violet,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a 10, 52, 10, all through
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would be like, this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are people doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was like, you know, what everyone
thought that you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now, you'll see people using our
triple 20 and blossom booster to as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the garden line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we started to dive in there and
really look at the genetics and the and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivars and the species that were
available when we started and started
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with it, we found that
manipulating ratios at the different crop
[SPEAKER_00]: stages really led to an overall healthier
looking crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were just going for let's try and
make a a crop of, you know, this cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like a healthy plant,
because we were running into different
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that would have like these
terribly yellow, stocky looking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, this cannot be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started playing with the
ratios at the different crop stages to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of enhance, you know, terpene
expression and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we eventually from 2008 and
10 to the release of this line in 2017
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dialed in the formulas that you
see as part of Jack's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see and I'm trying to read your website
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you have a part A and B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're giving a little bit of
phosphorus at the beginning and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: go to a 15, zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is purely nitrogen for veg and then
in the part B and then you switch over
[SPEAKER_01]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you give a fair bit, you have a 10,
30, 20, it looks like, and then finish
[SPEAKER_01]: with 7, 15, 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all on the Jack's Nutrient
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go and look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to write down or memorize
these numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you can you touch on sort of,
you know, each stage, just a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence or two on why, you know,
from a plant perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's really two different kind
of ways to go about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing with our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always start with looking at your
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started the water quality at the
source that you'll be growing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you using RO or are you,
you know, using water from your well or
[SPEAKER_00]: your city?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take a look at that and kind of
form a baseline with what you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we try and match that to formula
selection in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really suggest a lower percent
available phosphorus P2O5 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these formulas you'll see appear
nitrogen heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd be like 15, 5, 20, which is our
top formula or 12, 4, 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they appear like, oh, you know,
it's very nitrogen heavy, which the ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: does allow for, but you're feeding at a
parts per million of like 125 to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that balance of the nitrogen to
phosphorus to potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the formulas there do have
elevate in the in the nutrient line for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and cannabis almost always have
slightly elevated potassium than nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: across all stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we switch to flour, there is this
period of time, the bud initiation phase
[SPEAKER_00]: where we do promote and use a
concentration of available phosphorus that
[SPEAKER_00]: does, that is higher than almost anywhere
else in our programs for the short burst
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically surrounds the root zone
with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it available for plant
uptake for the short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, you know, floods the soil
solution, the small and large pore spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: with available phosphorus, and then it's
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by continuing, by shutting that down,
you don't have the negative effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, like, you know, excess stretch
and that type of stuff that would cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to really kind of look different as
it grows through its flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's only that small period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you move to flour,
again, we found that the ratios by
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing the nitrogen and increasing the
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a slightly different ratio for
nitrogen to potassium as the plant goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into its finished stage, it's,
it's shown great benefits to enhancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and also the terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the micros and the choice of
nitrogen that we use at those stages too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of all like a mixture of
this, but focusing on ratios through the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears that cannabis prefers its
nitrogen in the form of nitrate for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm seeing, can you talk a little bit
about, you said, you know, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the form of nitrogen and its importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our formulas have, some of them have
all nitrate, nitrogen, and some do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: slight amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of ammonium nitrogen in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial studies that we found was
that there is benefits from having a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of an ammonium and nitrate source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have urea in any of our formulas
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just like, we don't use that
source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the cool things we saw was like
at the clone stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning, there was a lot of
talk like, oh, for your clones or for your
[SPEAKER_00]: starter, like taking this from seed,
just seed at a lower nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of a balanced fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will, you know, be able to have a
successful clone stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've found with our clone is a
15-6-17, it actually has about a 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium nitrogen component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found with the ratio of that
product with the micros altogether,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to speed up root formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And branching and establishment from a
typical, you know, 10 to 14 days to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the plants really
thrived when we got that ratio of ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: to nitrate correct, which was kind of neat
to see because back then people just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, oh no, just feed at lower
strength and everything will be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we, and also everyone also
thought too, oh, you need a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our formula for clones is a 15-6-17.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has, it does not have that huge
phosphorus number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the right amount of phosphorus with
the ratio of nitrogen to potassium that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are folks typically using for
media with your fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how are your plants finishing in
terms of the EC levels in the media,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the look of the plant,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People use all different media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the beginning, it was just
like, it seemed like everyone was using
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of, a lot of growers that do
grow in rockwool and those types of inert
[SPEAKER_00]: medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, you know, soilless
mix, the versions of that come on in and
[SPEAKER_00]: people make their own mixtures doing all
these different things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the media can be several versions of
varieties of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, a lot of times when we set
people up with programs, we look at their
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then also consider the media
characteristics in order to start with a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that would be right for
their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you check on the website,
you'll see all these grow schedules,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are, which are really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you a great place to start
with Jax because it will kind of identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient concentrations that like you
said, aren't too much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never, what, what did someone say to
me the other day?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, Oh, well I was mixing your
fertilizer and I didn't think it was blue
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I add some added some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh my gosh, that is not how you
test the EC or strength of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to run into that with
your organic side of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, I mean, not so much the color,
but people are like, Oh, my buddy said I
[SPEAKER_01]: should use bat guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I added a bunch of bat guano or,
you know, whatever that thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, no, I, you know,
there's plenty of phosphorus already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need more pee, you know,
kind of thing, but growers want to tinker,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's, that's part of growing
is you feel like you have to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that gets carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that with our formulas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we kind of put those grow
schedules out there because it gave
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone kind of a place to start
tinkering, you know, and one of the useful
[SPEAKER_00]: things is too, when, when you're saying
with EC, because again, our ECs are very
[SPEAKER_00]: different than other companies are because
of the purity of the raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times people will say,
Oh my gosh, you know, that's, that's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that can't be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you know, grow a crop with
these ECs and, you know, we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, that's, it's measured to be exactly
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to add in your, you know,
obviously the EC of the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're starting with, but this is all
you really need to deliver those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll also see people kind of
tinkering around with their like watering
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see different growers leaching,
you know, and others not and, and
[SPEAKER_00]: recirculating systems and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the crop cycle,
we do tend to see EC levels increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: because especially our Finnish formula
does have a higher overall EC when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only feeding at a hundred parts per
million of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do recommend a four to seven day
flush in most growing environments right
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to talk about that actually,
because this is something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, one person got really upset with me
on, on Apple podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I said, you know, we don't really
flush with organic soils because the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients aren't for the most part,
aren't in a form that can be removed from
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you, I guess have too much
nitrates or sodium, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could flush out, but for the most
part, it, it's not the same as growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with mineral salts, but I'd love
to hear your thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if you are, let's just say in a
hypothetically, if you've got a perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in system, in theory, I wouldn't
think that there would be a lot to flush
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we constantly in like our internal
discussions talk about this because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we are suggesting feeding constant
liquid feed at this conservative lower end
[SPEAKER_00]: rate to really just kind of make sure
you're giving enough to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also suggesting testing the plant
through the crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really dial in, where your
nutrient concentration is both at the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone and in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you shouldn't have to flush at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have found through multiple
growers and people that worked with our
[SPEAKER_00]: products and other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seems like this is something
that is, is part of the culture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis is that they feel that,
you know, a flush increases the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the beneficial characteristics
of the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard people say, oh, well,
I make sure I flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so, you know, you know, when I
either mostly smoke it, it doesn't seem so
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, that's personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't, you know, think that
that's a, we haven't been able to show
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's a function of the nutrients
being flushed out of the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what's attributed to quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a, if it's a system that is
exhibiting the nutrient concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly for plant health and yield,
you shouldn't have to flush at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone done research where they've
done tissue testing on plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been flushed versus not flushed?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know with low EC in the media to show
that there actually is less a mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation in the tissue to where when
you did smoke it, it would be less,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, quote unquote, harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've done our own versions of
trials in multiple different like growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, like outside, inside,
you know, closed system, open system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the data just isn't clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's nothing to say this is
the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think possibly as these
universities do set up these environments
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can really dial in on specific,
that would be something that'd be super
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to know because it is a ton of
personal preference too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and varietal and cultivar specific,
which is makes it even more difficult,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't even talked about plant
stress and how that's impact on terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression or THC production, which is
obviously a role too, like possibly these
[SPEAKER_01]: flushes at the end, you know, create more
plant stress due to the water saturation,
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation, you know, affecting the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root hairs may be causing the plant to
produce more, you know, terpenes or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something interesting too,
in terms of targeted plant stress that I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen a lot of research with
cannabis on, but a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in a very exciting stage to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think anyone like in the,
in, in, in this cool environment is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and that's what I was talking to
you earlier about, you know, horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: is a community of people that are just
starving for knowledge and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is plants and, you know,
you think, you know, something about a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then just spending time with it
and watching it and manipulating certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always are in a great state to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and that's what I'm so
excited about with Jax for just doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing on the everyday, you know,
blending water solubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also working with growers to try and,
you know, help them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: reach their most optimum for their growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a combination of,
you know, uh, living soil or organics or
[SPEAKER_00]: different amendments and bio-stimulants,
it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, um, I feel thankful to be in this
industry at this time, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many opportunities do you have
in a lifetime to work on a plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually do research on that's
impactful?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you talk about corn, you know,
or some of these, you know, crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much research that's already
been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what's new to really try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with cannabis, it's a blank slate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's neat about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the mineral side, we're trying as
much as possible to provide pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as pure and, and, and high
quality water soluble, um, blends as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so that people, when they,
you know, whatever they're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and grow the crop,
they know that if they come and they see
[SPEAKER_00]: something with Jacks on it, there's
research behind here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is science based knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, you see a lot
of these other companies out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doing this, that, and the other,
and driving around cars with blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but this, this is where we need to
get for our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can all benefit from science,
factual knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, I'm a hardcore
organic guy, but if we can move away from
[SPEAKER_01]: bottled nutrients, you know, even just to
these powdered formulations, to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I realized that not everyone's going
to go organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, while that may be my
own life path, uh, there are reasons that
[SPEAKER_01]: people choose to grow with mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're going to do it,
like apply science, use the information
[SPEAKER_01]: that's out there and go with products that
are going to be safer and purer and more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated, um, for the reasons that you
listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not shipping things all over,
you know, a truck full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly is a ratio of an efficient
formula to deliver, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration that, that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't like all this other BS
involved, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to, you know, I'd be remiss if I
didn't focus a little bit more on water
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're seeing, um, we're seeing
some challenges on the organic side with
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are using RO water in regards
to possibly heavy metal uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as well as just how water impacts
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, obviously you have
different formulations based on water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about what you're looking at
when it comes to water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's kind of a big topic,
um, but specifically, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Aura wants to, to buffer,
but how do we, how do we accommodate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, water and, and, and pH and,
and these factors into our growing
[SPEAKER_01]: systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and, and we spend a lot of time on
this, just on, uh, this is really the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing when we talk about what we
deal with at Jax everyday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our, our laboratory onsite,
we probably have, you know, 50 to a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred different people sending us water
samples in a day, um, on, on a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a flow day, just trying to take a look at,
build their baseline to understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: important nutrient qualities are in their
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I look at a water source,
especially when I'm matching nutrition to
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, um, I look at the pH, the
alkalinity, which obviously is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a measure of the buffering capacity of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also a few of the,
um, secondary elements, mostly calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, and sulfur to see, you know,
what that buffering capacity or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, water alkalinity is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it from something good or something
bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bad things that you don't
want to see in your water is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium and chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at those elements,
just a quick and dirty glance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell right off the bat,
if this is a good water source,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another type of water source where
you're going to have to make some choices
[SPEAKER_00]: to balance nutrients correctly for
optimum, you know, plant nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know you can formulate around RO
pretty easily, um, on a chemical side,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for those of us on the organic side,
uh, there's some more challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know you're, you have a little
more chemistry background than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to get a chemist on the show
specifically to talk about water and heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals, but, um, is there anything you can
share along those lines in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, using RO water in an organic
media in terms of some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: around that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, RO is a, is a tough, it's not a
tough topic because it really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in, in a lot of times when I'm
talking to growers, growers that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to start, you know,
growing cannabis or growing hemp and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have anything figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if they want to try an
organic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know, you know, what their
water is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how they're even going to
set up their, their site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to get people at that stage
because you can really make some good
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RO water is useful in that it takes
out all of the potential bad that could
[SPEAKER_00]: come from a water source, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, too high sodium,
too high chloride, um, the boron is too
[SPEAKER_00]: high or the iron, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when in doing that, you really lose
the good things that also come from water
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're working with a grower,
especially in an organic setting where
[SPEAKER_00]: they, you know, are using RO, my first
thought for organic or mineral side is
[SPEAKER_00]: that that grower needs to understand that
every time they deliver water to their,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants, they need to also make
sure that they're building a solution in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone that has all of the
essential elements that the plant needs
[SPEAKER_00]: for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an organic setting, making sure that
you have those sources of secondary and
[SPEAKER_00]: micro nutrients that are not only
immediately available, but are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, slowly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always there as a source is
important for a grower that is using an RO
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as important if you have a really
great well where you already have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of calcium to magnesium,
some sulfur, some microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of takes some of the pressure off,
but RO, you know, really kicks it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: that next level where you have to remember
at all times, you have to provide these
[SPEAKER_00]: essential nutrients for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about the fact that RO,
you know, it's, it wants to bond with
[SPEAKER_01]: water, wants to bond with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like surviving in a vacuum like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, we are like,
for example, I had a, I had a grower using
[SPEAKER_01]: these, uh, galvanized stakes and they,
they were stripped pretty quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, from, from water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with RO water, um, well, I guess any
water would eventually do it, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we were concerned possibly
that might lead to higher heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how does RO water or water in general
interact with, um, heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know pH plays a big role, which we
haven't really talked about in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake, but, um, can you touch on the
water aspect there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, certain things, um,
all nutrients really are more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: available according to the pH that is in
the nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases for micronutrients,
the more acidic of a pH of soil solution
[SPEAKER_00]: or soil colloid environment, um,
the more available those ions will be for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to be able to take them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other way around too,
as the pH gets above mostly like 6,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, 6, 5, you'll see a pretty sharp
decrease in how certain nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: available for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO not having any, you know, any charge
associated with it is constantly looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to balance itself by stealing,
um, you know, one or two, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: negative or positive charges to kind of
make it, make itself get to equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's just very interesting because
what you have available in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: solution or in your soil environment will
interact back and forth with your water
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I'm trying to think like,
now I forgot what your question was,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad, so you'll have to remind me,
but am I going on the right path?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just wondering how, you know,
say water that is, you know, well watered,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus RO water, you know, water that has
minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what differences might we expect
in a, in a soil media or soilless media in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of, uh, heavy metal uptake or,
um, other effects, you know, with a
[SPEAKER_01]: buffered water versus, you know,
unbuffered water, I guess is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main thing to be concerned
about is the pH and the buffering because
[SPEAKER_00]: that does have a, you know, uh,
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On, on pH swings in, in the water source,
you have a completely pure water source
[SPEAKER_00]: that's living at a pH that is in the mid
to low five, almost anything, including
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and heavy metals are going
to have just tend to be more available and
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using an RO water,
um, in most cases, and, and with the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of the fertilizers that we have,
we try to keep the, um, pH between six of
[SPEAKER_00]: eight and six, two in order to keep that
perfect kind of like mostly available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not too available on the acidic side
or not none available at the basic side so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can, you know, just allow a
perfect array of what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using any water source and
it's living at a pH where things,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it makes things more available,
you're going to see increased uptakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH and alkalinity of the water source
is most important, um, no matter where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting your water from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, you know, those were my main
questions for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else you wanted to,
uh, talk about or add?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I feel like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to talk about a lot of fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that, you know, we can continue our
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super happy to be asked to be on your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is what the future of our
industry needs to always consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people with knowledge on their
little sector of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm like, uh, a mineral, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do on the day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But conversations like this, that you are,
especially through your podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to bring people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only going to benefit our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I applaud you and thank you so much for
having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the conversation and,
uh, please reach out as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: read new research becomes available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get back on and chat about
that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, we at Jax are trying to help
answer some of these like, basic plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition on the mineral side questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing all these little like
get technical videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any suggestions what your kind of,
um, group would love to hear us address,
[SPEAKER_00]: please reach out or we really like
