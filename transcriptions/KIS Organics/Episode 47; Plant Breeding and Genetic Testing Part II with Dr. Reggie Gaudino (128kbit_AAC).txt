[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting off the podcast,
I want to tell you about some exciting new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now officially registered for our
soils and nutrient pack with the CDFA in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through the process of registering
as
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic Cure in Washington as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to be adding some new hydro shops
and garden centers in other states here
[SPEAKER_00]: soon, but don't hesitate to contact your
local shop or have them reach out to us if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is a follow-up with
our guest, Reggie Gaudino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie is the Chief Science Officer for
Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gaudino oversees all scientific
research and development for Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: and is the driving force for Steep Hill's
genetic research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gaudino directed a team of researchers
which led to the development of GenKit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first cannabis DNA-based sex test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research from Dr. Gaudino has been
peer-reviewed and published, leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: important new discoveries in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gaudino received his B.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Molecular Biology and Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Molecular Genetics from the State
University of New York at Buffalo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he conducted four years of
post-doctoral research at Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: University in St. Louis, studying
transcriptional regulation of our RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie was one of the first
African-American molecular biologists to
[SPEAKER_00]: enter a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the United States in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Reggie, thanks for coming on the show
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually honored and surprised that
you have me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the feedback from the show was really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all really positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind, we'll just dive right
in with some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one of the things in the podcast
that you had mentioned was that you had
[SPEAKER_00]: worked at Monsanto and some people reached
out to me really concerned about Monsanto
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you elaborate a little more about
what the future holds and the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like Steep Hill?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you were to develop an
effective genetic marker with the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: what assurances do growers have that their
data isn't going to be used by a company
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself or other companies in this
space and then turned around and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: out by a company like Bayer who owns
Monsanto?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so these are great questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me start with...
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did my postdoc at Washington
University in St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of my postdoctoral research
was done in conjunction with Monsanto and
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Monsanto campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually not ever worked or been
paid by Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make that very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so to the rest of the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data is an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I get approached with this a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know that you're not going to do
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when you take an individual sample
and you look at it and you sequence it,
[SPEAKER_02]: all you really have is that sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the only sample you look at,
you can't really make any calls about what
[SPEAKER_02]: else is going on in a genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The power of genomics doesn't come until
you have a lot of DNA sequences aggregated
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you start to look at differences
in the aggregated data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at it from that
perspective, any one person's data is not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to give you any answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not until you actually have tens or
hundreds of samples to then align and or
[SPEAKER_02]: number crunch against each other where you
start to see patterns fall out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ether.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when somebody comes to me and says
that, I say, well, your data point is just
[SPEAKER_02]: one of many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with your one data point, you can't do
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the aggregation of all the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in reality, it's the work that we do on
the back end after we've done all this
[SPEAKER_02]: other sequencing that allows us to make
any calls and see any differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not to minimize the fact that
growers spend a lot of time building
[SPEAKER_02]: unique cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't tell it's unique from the
genetic perspective unless you compare it
[SPEAKER_02]: to a bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having said that, you have to do the
kind of analysis that they're afraid of to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to see anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get to the point where this
has been litigated in regular chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: type science and other sciences where,
in fact, there's a whole level of
[SPEAKER_02]: infringement payment analysis that's done
based on the contribution of that one data
[SPEAKER_02]: point to the overall system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it takes a thousand points to be
able to make a call, then the person's
[SPEAKER_02]: really only entitled to one one thousandth
of the payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens right now in
patent law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting back to the question,
it's important for people to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that in order to be able to give them any
advice on breeding or markers,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to be able to aggregate data and
look at it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, any one data point becomes
a lot less important, even though it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very important to the client.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to look at it from both
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what C-PIL has done is we've done a lot
of sequencing and we have done a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've found markers for THC, CBD,
olivatolic acid, 55 different terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: genes, flowering genes, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have built a library of markers that
we can then turn around and use to help
[SPEAKER_02]: people do better breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we couldn't have done that
without looking at everybody's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is then we turn around and
we offer that information to staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The markers, we allow anybody who would
like to breed for that marker to use our
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic services.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ourselves, and this is unique to
California, and we can go into examples of
[SPEAKER_02]: other companies that are not doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of us, where we are,
we actually cannot hold any financial
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in any other license in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cannot have a cultivation license,
I can't have a dispensary license,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have a nursery license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I can do at C-PIL is actually
sequence and then offer markers to
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding services where people bring us
their DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the analysis and say, hey,
you have this allele, it's the right one,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you would like to be able to breed,
then this is what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We offer consulting services based on the
marker analysis and sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other companies out there have taken
some data, and I think this is poignant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not trying to bash anybody,
but right now there are companies out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that are under scrutiny because they
have in fact taken their clients' data and
[SPEAKER_02]: used it for their own personal gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to mention names or
anything like that, but if people look
[SPEAKER_02]: deep enough in the industry, they'll find
exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next part of this question is what
happens if Bayer buys our data or absorbs
[SPEAKER_02]: me and buys my data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I go into that, let me give
something else, which is I think a basic
[SPEAKER_02]: misconception.
[SPEAKER_02]: In patent law, unless you are the
inventor, you cannot file for a patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do file for a patent and somebody
challenged it, it is basically thrown out
[SPEAKER_02]: almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will cost a little money to prove it,
but yes, they don't have a leg to stand
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with those two things in mind,
if Bayer or Monsanto were to come and buy
[SPEAKER_02]: Steep Hill, they would get our marker
database, yes, because that marker
[SPEAKER_02]: database was something that we created as
RIP based on sequencing thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we get back to the any one
strain doesn't tell you anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be of a concern because a
Monsanto or a Bayer could then use all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that data to jump start.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not anything that someone else
can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can offer that same breeding service to
any number of seed companies in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry now, and they could do
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the technology is there and being built
for the cannabis industry to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the nature of that data,
it doesn't allow anybody to patent their
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, but it does allow them to do the
same breeding if they can get the same
[SPEAKER_02]: germplasm, which is a problem in the
industry because what we do in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is we put clones in dispensaries
anyway and sell them for 10 bucks a pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to, as an industry,
understand a little better where the lines
[SPEAKER_02]: are drawn in these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, you can't patent somebody
else's strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to and they can prove it,
you're going to lose the patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Developing markers for breeding can't be
done just using one strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be done with the aggregate data
from a lot of strains, in which case what
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done now is removed from the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had to go and take a look at it and
say, OK, why are these things different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do these differences occur?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how then can we follow them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of work that goes into
that that is devoid of the person's
[SPEAKER_02]: personal DNA sequence for his strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a difficult thing to get
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're in a different situation
in the cannabis industry because typically
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff was all done by seed companies,
big seed companies that did it all
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house and did all the work that's C-PIL
does in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Monsanto doesn't go to a C-PIL to
have them sequence their DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it all in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do understand that there's this fear
factor because I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry doesn't understand the power of
genetics or what genetics can and cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think there's a way to assure
people that something like that can't
[SPEAKER_02]: happen because they're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years from now, 10 years from now,
whoever the board of directors is at C-PIL
[SPEAKER_02]: could say, holy crap, we just got offered
a billion dollars for C-PIL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, we're going to sell,
in which case they would get everything
[SPEAKER_02]: locked back in barrel, including the IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so remotely, is that a concern?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we don't have to worry about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the big blue chip stock
people are ready to come into the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that still gives us a couple of years
to lay the foundation for which they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: do any of this, which is then we,
as an industry, have to take the
[SPEAKER_02]: information that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genetic sequence has been developed by
the companies like myself and MG,
[SPEAKER_02]: Middletown Genomics and Philos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to use those tools to our
advantage so that we can put out patents
[SPEAKER_02]: and intellectual property that keep people
like from Monsanto from coming in and then
[SPEAKER_02]: benefiting from exactly what they're
afraid of, buying a company like mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then having all this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the patents and the strains are
already out there, it doesn't really help
[SPEAKER_02]: them all that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have to work around all those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that address the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that any one person's
genetic marker is really just a drop in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any intrinsic value by
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when combined with a bunch of other
data, it has value because you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations and draw conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I would say to that,
though, is I have friends, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are vegetarian because they're very
against our industrial meat process,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I completely understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they abstain from that fully knowing
that they're they're abstaining from
[SPEAKER_00]: eating meat is probably not going to
affect the overall American market for
[SPEAKER_00]: meat consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for them, it's an ethical principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that around growers,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any is there any way,
though, to use these tools to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: science without without risking or this
sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it really one of those things that
if you want to use this technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just something that you have to risk
with with your with your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a way to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not everybody has to get their whole
genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I when I speak of marker tests,
we don't sequence them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole genome to look at the markers,
we've developed high throughput assays
[SPEAKER_02]: that have the ability to just look at that
one marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say somebody sends in,
you know, a sample to us and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: want CBD and that's all we look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're only charging him 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go and spend,
you know, a thousand dollars to sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: his own whole genome to give him the
answer he's looking for when I can do it
[SPEAKER_02]: for 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that sample stay in the
repository?
[SPEAKER_02]: For future work?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the way we do it is, is we if we
if we see in the course of working with a
[SPEAKER_02]: client that we have something special from
that client, we will definitely then try
[SPEAKER_02]: to engage them in a fuller investigation
of the genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we're we're in this to create a
business and the business is most
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently done by just looking for the
markers people check off on.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I at the end of the day,
I'm trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I do additional work, I'm losing
money because I'm not charging a lot for
[SPEAKER_02]: the service in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm charging 15 or 20 bucks a
marker, that's really, really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you look at looking marker
analysis in human genomes, it costs
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands and thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so in order to participate
using these tools, you have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship and a trust with the lab.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you you go to a lab like mine
where we are precluded from doing anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're afraid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you go to a lab in Oregon
where they're not precluded or you go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lab, let's say in Arkansas, where they you
know, who knows what lab is offering these
[SPEAKER_02]: services.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go to another lab where they
have the ability to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: breed and create their own germplasm,
well, then there is clearly a potential
[SPEAKER_02]: for conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very sensitive to that because of
the fact that, you know, I myself am a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant biologist and have worked for 22
years in intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am very, very sensitive to the plight
of the person who is potentially going
[SPEAKER_02]: down this path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spent 22 years writing patents and
protecting patents for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we put together our service,
it was from the perspective of we do not
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be a competitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be a partner.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people we will never have people trust
us if we turn around and start breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that we absolutely do
not do at CECO.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but it is a concern and people need to
do their own due diligence to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and read the intake form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every every genetic service out there
has a intake form contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the fine print, you know,
see what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I specifically state that I get I have the
right to use the data for aggregate
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I and I clearly state that I will that
I that I make no claims to the to the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain or to or to the DNA itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not go out and try and patent your
DNA because it's not my DNA for the
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why I said before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those things are stated in my
intake form.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I clearly state you you're bringing me
your data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a result and I'm
going to use this data for further
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregate research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so it's important for people
to I think, you know, read the fine print
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure they do their due diligence
before choosing a genetic partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's you brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a red flag for me or I guess more
of a sore spot because like my father,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, he he originally was designed
and made a compost tea brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was working with a particular lab
who was collecting all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was paying them for these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they were recommending
his brewer because of the level he was
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down the road, you know,
five, six years, they came out with their
[SPEAKER_00]: own line of compost tea brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took that data and that
information that they gathered from my
[SPEAKER_00]: father and others who were using their lab
to gain this information and then came out
[SPEAKER_00]: with a competing product, which you're
right, it's not illegal, but ethically and
[SPEAKER_00]: morally, it's a little bit suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be my concern as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you mentioned there is in states like
Oregon where they could they could do
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have heard exactly what you're
alluding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would concern me to know that my data
is being used to essentially help out a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitor in my own state, in my
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a that's a very valid concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it it absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so but at the same time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, without the ability to
aggregate data and to see differences,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's take the barrens.
[SPEAKER_02]: T.H.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if you just look at T.H.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA from a barren strain, right,
you have no idea what makes it a barren
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not until you compare it to a
non-barren strain and you can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: points of difference that you can tell why
a barren strain is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's only after that analysis on
a much larger scale can you actually
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonably make calls as to what markers
might be useful for breeding to follow
[SPEAKER_02]: producing barren strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so at some point there has
to be an acceptance in the industry for at
[SPEAKER_02]: least a basic level of genetic
investigation and and and utility.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because without it, we will always be
behind April.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly what is done in every
other commercial crash crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we do things a little bit
differently here because a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: work is done internally to a big company
like Monsanto or Dow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it all internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the companies in the cannabis
industry, at least beginning, had the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that there are some big C
companies now that are doing quite well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, selling, you know, millions and
millions of dollars a year of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of these labs can then start to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it's an expensive undertaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have to start thinking about,
you know, sequencing all your strains and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the setting up a molecular
biology lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then once you have your
strength sequence, if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: method developed for using that
information, you're still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: at square one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes a lot of work to be able to
set up a robust genetic service a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: than people would probably realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because of that, it's not something
that you can bring in house unless you are
[SPEAKER_02]: a very large company or you have the money
like behind them and Andy, sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: an Aurora or a canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: People with that kind of money can do can
consider this path internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it has to be done through the
use of a third of a third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you a random, slightly off topic
question here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You continually use the word strain as a
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there is there a particular reason you
use that nomenclature over a varietal or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the industry itself,
cultivar or actually cultivar is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not even correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemovar is the actual correct
terminology, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can take the same genetics and
grow it multiple different ways and get
[SPEAKER_02]: different chemical outputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So realistically, we should be we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the problem with strain names
in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it tells you really nothing,
even the genetics tells you nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: without knowing the environment in which
it was grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chemovar is actually probably the most
accurate terminology for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what you're the data you're collecting
now would be the best if we were to refer
[SPEAKER_00]: to an actual plant, a plant, it would be a
varietal, then wouldn't it be because it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be expressed into different kind of
ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be a specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I get material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so cultivar varietal, I think
cultivar and varietal are fairly close in
[SPEAKER_02]: their meaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, I see that more
people are adopting varietal and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the from the names from the
strain designation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say that varietal is definitely a
step in the right direction and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially varietal with a sub
classification of a specific chemovar.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this varietal this chemovar from this
varietal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and because remember, there is also the
possibility that you could have different
[SPEAKER_02]: varietal that have overlapping chemovars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so ultimately depends on what what
question you're asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really concerned about just the
chemistry, then then it would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemovar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are concerned about the
genetics, that would be varietal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with a designation of the
chemovar output you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_02]: which then designates some environmental
boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a question that someone had
asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I'd pose it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing topics one more time,
you mentioned a little bit some numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit around Steep Hill in
terms of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what sorts of markers are you
currently able to test for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have so we we've had, obviously,
the sex and the CBD test have been
[SPEAKER_02]: available from us for 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have expanded the CBD test so that it
now tells us specifically, we can identify
[SPEAKER_02]: those that are 20 to one or higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have expanded our,
you know, our cannabinoid testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the gene for CBGA synthase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really called that's called
aromatic parental transferase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody understands that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call it CBGA synthase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a marker for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a marker for the upstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have markers for geraniol pyrophosphate
synthase, which is, or at least one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: subunits, which is one of the feeders into
making CBGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the other side as well,
the olivitalic acid cyclase or olivitalic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid synthase, depending on whether you
use the new or the old nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two things are key to making the
compounds that are then condensed into
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going further back up that stream on
each side, although those are less well
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have mapped 55 active terpene genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the final phases of putting
together the the validation that would
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us to be able to call each of those
55 individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tough job because there's so much
similarity in the terpene gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting closer on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the cannabinoid,
I realized I didn't finish that thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also now have developed a bunch of
THCA markers that, when used in
[SPEAKER_02]: conjunction with CBD markers, actually
allows us to start to get a handle on
[SPEAKER_02]: different ratios other than the 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we think we have markers that,
when you combine the marker test,
[SPEAKER_02]: they identify those things that come out
like 2 to 1, like 5 to 4 to 1,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 to 1, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then on top of that, we have started
looking at all the fatty acyl synthases
[SPEAKER_02]: because, again, those are involved in oil
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are crossed over into hemp as
well, same genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oil production in general is becoming a
more important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've started down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of fatty acyl synthase
genes that are involved in hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the flowering genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clot genes are things like
photoperiod, things that affect trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all either in validation or
in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones that are available right now
are sex, all the cannabinoid ones that I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, and then many of the terpene
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other ones are in earlier stages of
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was a breeder and I wanted to go
through this process with Steep Hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned some costs around $15 to $30
for a particular marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just come in, fill out this form,
and select what markers were most
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would submit what I assume is a
leaf tissue sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it used to be that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, you wouldn't have to come
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually do it online or through
phone call.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we recommend, though, is depending
on the person's comfortableness with
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times we'll get people who
don't really know how to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do an initial consultation,
which is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just get on a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask you what your goals are,
what are you trying to breed for,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are your sort of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get an idea of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can suggest how to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it no longer is leaf-based because
that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she can't ship across state lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we now use a card from GE Health Care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the FTA plant saver card.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the beautiful thing about this card is
that you can do a leaf print on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get DNA off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It carries a very small amount of
cannabinoids because it's designed for
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have different processes that we
recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a way that you can send us the
card where a small enough leaf print will
[SPEAKER_02]: not have enough cannabinoid to be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can actually do some limited
cannabinoid ratio analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the card does not capture the chemistry
in a quantitative fashion, but it does in
[SPEAKER_02]: a qualitative fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you have a 2 to 1 TBD to THG
ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see that ratio preserved in what
comes off the card in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can't tell you that it was 20%
because it doesn't capture quantitatively,
[SPEAKER_02]: just qualitatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that allows us to do a little bit
extra analysis for you because now we can
[SPEAKER_02]: do the CBD THC genes and then say,
hey, and here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on what we got off the card,
it looks like that you have a 2 to 1
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supported by the DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me take an aside right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until somebody has a perfectly true
breeding stabilized strain, DNA just
[SPEAKER_02]: represents a potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really important concept for
people to understand because very few
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes are due to a single gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like THC synthase makes THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a whole feeder pathway that
feeds the THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something upstream of the gene is
not optimized, you may never see the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit of having the best THC gene in
your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is a lot of it just
tells you the genetic potential of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you took that plant, planted it in
cocoa, and then grew it very poorly or
[SPEAKER_00]: under poor lighting conditions or
watering, you may not get that result that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that becomes less and less of a
concern as you go through your breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: program and you've optimized all of the
genes that are important for the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, that's why we're going back up
the pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're looking at the GPP and
the lipotelic acid synthase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this way, as the library expands,
you actually can breed and select for the
[SPEAKER_02]: optimized plant that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beauty of genetics is you can
select for these things all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, let's say you're looking
for a turpinoline dominant, THC dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that is drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, drought resistance is something that
we're working on as well as our many
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of stress response in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking at some of those as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you have the markers,
you can do a breeding, crack a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and pull out the five that have the
markers that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the power of what the
library and the marker assisted breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: gives you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to grow all thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just find at germination the five
that were the ones that had the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you were looking for, toss the rest
and just work on those five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as this technology becomes more mature,
it actually provides greater benefit for
[SPEAKER_02]: the real savvy genetic breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now it's not just pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just going out there and
rubbing stems and smelling your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually intelligently designed
breeding programs based on markers that
[SPEAKER_02]: are known and can be followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the Monsantos and the
Dallas do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we take our industry to that
level without having them do it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one question I have then is you
mentioned popping a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then doing the marker testing,
you know, a thousand fifteen dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: markers alone would be fifteen grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start looking at more markers,
how does this become affordable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, you know, we we do offer both
pricing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And on both the number of tests and like
any company, you're going to end up both
[SPEAKER_02]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody comes in and they want to
test on, it's fifteen dollars a test,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to test on for a hundred for
a hundred cents, for example, the price
[SPEAKER_02]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are both pricing opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's actually different
relationships and different companies do
[SPEAKER_02]: this differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, if you're looking for a
large enough a large enough swath of
[SPEAKER_02]: markers, then we would probably try to
recommend that you join the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: program, which is different, involves some
sequencing and allows us to do a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more in depth analysis that costs more
upfront, but saves money and time later.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so it's also important to
understand that genetic services come in
[SPEAKER_02]: at many different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very simple, basic analysis
where you can do sex test and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, you know, analysis where
as you go down a breeding program,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're trying to understand how
stabilized your strain is right for any
[SPEAKER_02]: given marker where you actually do need to
do sequencing along the way in the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program to understand what's
called the heterozygosity homozygosity
[SPEAKER_02]: index.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more homozygous you are at many
positions, the closer you are to
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilized and true breeding, which is
ultimately what we need to be if we would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to go towards, you know, stable
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so genetic services themselves come
in, you know, like bronze, silver and gold
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of level tiering.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and again, a good genetic partner is
not going to try to sell you the gold or
[SPEAKER_02]: platinum service all the time if they can
get you the answer at the bronze level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we started with the
single marker test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that people could jump in and play
around very inexpensively and get to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been, you know, pretty good for a
number of companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had a number of seed companies
that in Northern California that spent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a few tens of thousands of
dollars with us, you know, over the course
[SPEAKER_02]: of two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we and to be quite honest,
we've never seen them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So MTG seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they probably be upset if I said their
name, but I did anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came to us a few years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We helped them with our high CBD test.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came back the second following year
to do a follow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They established their germplasm for their
high CDB strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen them since.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been two years since I've seen
anybody from MTG seeds, but we were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get them to a point where they had a
stable population of CBD plants that were,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were used for germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it, it doesn't always have to be
very expensive, but even though it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fair bit of money upfront at a thousand
seeds at 15 bucks a pop, even though it
[SPEAKER_02]: would probably be closer to like eight or
nine bucks a pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's still, you know,
ends up becoming a savings down the line
[SPEAKER_02]: because now think of all the time and
money you have saved from not having to do
[SPEAKER_02]: phenol hunting on thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it seems, so there's no way
around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money has to be spent, but that money is
almost always recouped and fairly rapidly
[SPEAKER_02]: on the backend when you end up being able
to streamline your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're cutting out the growing
process, which costs money in labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, I know even just a couple of
seasons ago for my father growing some
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plants, we had, you know,
we were growing from, from seeds and had
[SPEAKER_00]: had a couple of males sneak through that I
didn't catch till later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew them a lot bigger than I would
have, you know, I invested more time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and nutrients into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to, and 15 bucks would have
been a bargain at that point in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: my labor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but here's the beautiful thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, you know, stability is this thing
that is an amorphous term in the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: and genetics in, um, in cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But so if you, if you pop seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you get to, let's say the
second node, you, you, you do a leaf print
[SPEAKER_02]: of one of the leaves, you send it in,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that you're, you're a week in maybe,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get the answers back in less
than a week, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or about a week or less, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and sometimes it depends on the
time of the season, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wasted a last second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get I get like 40,000 tests
dumped on me in two weeks as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people starting early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but you know, the turnaround time
is definitely dependent on what time of
[SPEAKER_02]: the year it is and how many people waited
to very late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what ends up happening is if you
do it early enough, you actually have time
[SPEAKER_02]: to go back and call, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even replant new seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically you should get,
you could be able to increase your female
[SPEAKER_02]: population by at least 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and because you're only two weeks in
most plants in that first two week period,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't be that far behind when it
comes time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially outdoors, you know,
so you actually end up increasing your
[SPEAKER_02]: population of females relative to just
cracking seeds and not doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you end up with a higher yield on
the front end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also see you save all that resource
that, you know, however, four or five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six weeks, but you, you can figure out
it's a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you save all those resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now, you know, you, you,
you've made some gains right there alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's the beautiful thing,
because you could do it so early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not worried about growing
for flower, but really just breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: now you have a foot tall plant or two foot
tall plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to grow it full.
[SPEAKER_02]: You force flower, you, you pollinate it
with your chosen pollen and you start to
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're, you're really only two or
three months in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you go from one generation a year,
or maybe two generations a year to five or
[SPEAKER_02]: six generations a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now making stable seeds doesn't
take 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes two or three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so these are the benefits that people
don't realize that you get with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to follow traits very early on,
because you don't get a whole plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: know you got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my takeaway is that even if you're not,
uh, interested in breeding necessarily as
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower, some of these tools can still be
accessible and beneficial for you down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just the time and resource
management that you get out of being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this is, you know, but again,
this is if you grow from seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody grows from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those who grow from seed,
this is a very beneficial early entry into
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sex test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're, if you're,
if you're interested in just growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say CBD, you do sex test and CBD and
you've out of a random bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that CBD test identifies,
you know, what your highest THC CBD or the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest CBD THC ratio will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you, you, you've got all this
information that, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would have needed a fairly long time
to be able to discern otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to, I want to talk a little bit
about stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned plant stress in terms of,
uh, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you know, when a plant is
stressed, it can change or produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, higher, higher levels of,
uh, THC and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear the story of the person
who had their, you know, I had everything
[SPEAKER_00]: go wrong with their equipment on a cycle
and grew the, you know, not, not as well
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding, but some of the best quality
cannabis that they'd ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of stress, I guess I have two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, do we have any, any research that
you've seen around, uh, controlling that
[SPEAKER_00]: stress response in, in a plant as it,
as it moves towards seed or move towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, senescence?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, uh, in terms of stress
itself, is there any evidence going from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, successional clones that you can
see a genetic change over, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: over successive generations with a large
stressor in there at some point during the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's life?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, let me ask the answer to the
second question first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer to that is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So epigenetics is a change in the DNA that
is caused by environmental perturbations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically it occurs by methylation of DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sometimes it's not methylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there are other addicts that are
added to DNA, um, you know, other,
[SPEAKER_02]: other groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Methyl is a, is a, is a CHD group,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and so, um, there, in,
in, in response to environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors, you know, things are turned off
and or turned on and the stress leaves a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a, a discernible footprint on the DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that by treating the DNA two
different ways in sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take the DNA from the plant,
we sequence it straight, or we treat it
[SPEAKER_02]: with something called bisulfite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, after bisulfite treatment,
we sequence it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because of that, bisulfite causes
certain modified nucleotides to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can see where these addicts were
added in the, the DNA, uh, based on
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressors do affect the DNA and,
and, and epigenetically, they are
[SPEAKER_02]: inheritable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will see the offspring of those
stress plants carrying that signature as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, uh, they've seen it go
out as many as five or six generations in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, and sometimes even a mice,
if you stress mice, you get the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, and so this, this phenomenon,
epigenetic phenomenon is not just unique
[SPEAKER_02]: to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens in all organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting to the first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, a lot of this kind of research is
just happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, so we, we haven't had a lot of
research dollars for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but what I will say is that I was at a
conference just recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, in Colorado, um, at public
Colorado, it was the international
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis research, uh, organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so we have, some presentations
where somebody went around and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the stressors was designed to mimic
like insects eating leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went when I was a hole punch and
they hole punched, uh, the leaves of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, different amounts of holes on
different cannabis to see whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: they could see a difference in the
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, they were able to see an
increase in cannabinoid and certain
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene production, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when they, when they punched holes and
the more holes they punched, the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: the response up to a level, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't, it didn't double it or
anything, but you could definitely see,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that there was an increase in
expression and this increase in expression
[SPEAKER_02]: is staying at, at the transcription level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the RNA, which then more RNA usually
means more enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the RNA shot up in response to
this, to this nibbling stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole punch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the same conference, people did
something similar with uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: drought stress, you know, overwatering,
underwatering, and they found that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drought stress does in fact
increase cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, um, maybe I shouldn't say
this because I don't remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember this a hundred percent,
but I think they actually found that
[SPEAKER_02]: overwatering had some effect as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what that effect was,
but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but the problem is, is that,
you know, there's really no facility that
[SPEAKER_02]: did this before we, we have a few
universities like in Colorado that are
[SPEAKER_02]: just starting to look at some of these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been getting, I've been getting a
lot of questions from, um, from breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and cultivators about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have actually entered into some,
you know, collaborative work with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: our partners where they're doing these
things and we're looking at the RNA
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis and we're giving them,
you know, the chemical results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a very interesting and
pertinent and timely question,
[SPEAKER_02]: but unfortunately we are at the very
beginning of getting answers to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to caution listeners too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variability associated
with this, you know, as we start changing
[SPEAKER_00]: a varietal or cultivar or an environment
that can change the results someone would
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you're opening yourself up to
greater risk of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, when you stress a plant at any
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I do not, so let me just say,
I do not recommend going around with a
[SPEAKER_02]: hole punch and punching holes in the
leaves and your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: because what you have just done is opened
it up for invasion from bacteria mold and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially even viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing, and this is something
else that we should, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is kind of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the back of everybody's mind,
but we don't really talk about it because
[SPEAKER_02]: we haven't really hit true agronomic
proportions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by that, I mean, we're not doing,
you know, tens of thousands of acres of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of corn, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but now that the hemp field is
changing and, and, and people are becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: more acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing, and the thing was going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see that we are going to have
loud, large outdoor hemp and or cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then we will have stepped into a
completely other unknown area for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that has played the agronomic sector
sector for decades, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, plant pathogens that are not
bacterial or, or, you know, fungal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are all sorts of nasty viruses out
there that love to predate plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are starting to ask questions
about tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, and, and it's close
relative hemp, hemp, hemp, hemp spot
[SPEAKER_02]: virus, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, which is also a mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's something that's even more
disturbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mosaic viruses, tobacco mosaic virus,
cauliflower mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic
[SPEAKER_02]: virus, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all fairly closely related and it
doesn't take long from one for one type to
[SPEAKER_02]: exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be packaged on another plant for that
it to become a hemp russet mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so as we get to larger and larger
scales, we will start to see all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we haven't even started to
approach yet in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anything around powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some companies making tests
for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what can you elaborate for people
that are curious about how to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how to protect against that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah, so powdery mildew,
again, you know, disease resistance in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, but powdery mildew is
particularly problematic for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of companies and we're associated
with one pathogen DX.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of their development work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we didn't, we isolated powdery mildew
from a number of different friends around
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States and from our labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent it out for sequencing with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so we have a powdery mildew test
that we have that we make available
[SPEAKER_02]: through pathogen DX medicinal genomics has
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So powdery mildew is interesting because
it's actually usually a combination of two
[SPEAKER_02]: or more organs and organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but one of them is always kind of the
same, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems to be one common organism
in all types of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those tests are, are, are out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that, you know, if you get a
hit for powdery mildew and one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: tests, you should, you should assume you
have powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it, it, the test itself is
fairly robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way those tests work, like with any
other, uh, identification test is,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, ribosomal RNA, which is, uh,
something this is like biology one-on-one,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, ribosomal RNA is what, um,
makes protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the, is part of the structure that
makes protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the thing called the ribosome,
the ribosome, you know, chugs along the
[SPEAKER_02]: RNA transcript and spits out protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, is that, um, you know,
in the ribosomal RNA of any organism,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are, there is a unique signature
that is unique to that organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've used the, what is called the ITS1
and ITS2 regions of ribosomal RNA to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to identify organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and so it's a very accurate
methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around for decades and,
and, and that's what we used to pull out
[SPEAKER_02]: the DNA from powdery mildew and identify
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I say if you get a hit,
it's probably real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but then, you know, the question,
that's an after the fact thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or it allows you to actually screen
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying clones, getting a powdery
mildew test is a really good idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: a really good idea because, um,
powdery mildew may in fact, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you know, people, some people say
it does, some people say it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: but powdery mildew may in fact become
interstitial, which means that it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cell spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though you don't see it on the
surface, it may come out later,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so by doing the DNA based testing or
the microbiome testing of a clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will identify if it's been exposed to
that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but on the other hand,
there are some very simple ways to prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So good ventilation, you know,
uh, don't not too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start to see that little
white kind of discoloration on a leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: you hit it with pH, you know, 9.5 or
higher water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alkaline water kills it dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so there are ways to actually,
you know, prevent it from happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are ways to screen to keep it
out of your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go the clone route, typically
seeds, you know, seeds don't carry powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's something that happens from,
you know, growing conditions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess approaching it from a growing
perspective, um, environment does play a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge role, but how much of those,
the particular, uh, fungal spores or
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that you're seeing there,
how, how are those, um, how ubiquitous are
[SPEAKER_00]: those in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the risk of just airborne
spores coming into your grow or are these
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically being brought over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more like a hemp russet mite of the
fungal world where we're passing it on
[SPEAKER_00]: humans or passing it on plant material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an answer for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never thought about it from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do know that there are strains that
are more or less resistant to powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, LA confidential is one of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, um, it's, it's extremely,
extremely sensitive to powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so because of strains or cultivar
genetics, there are differences in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability or the susceptibility to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that much we know whether or not it is
airborne or carried by insects or other
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms, I cannot answer, but I will be
more than happy to look that up and get
[SPEAKER_02]: back to you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know like just from, uh,
as a vegetable farmer, I know that these
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew being a catchall for
anything that produces any fungal strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that produces that, uh, you know,
white powdery looking material on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, when you mentioned that it's
more than one organism, I thought that was
[SPEAKER_00]: really important for people to realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it may be different here in
Washington state than it is in California
[SPEAKER_00]: or Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern is, for example,
I'm working specifically with a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that's battling powdery mildew at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he could go get one of those tests,
but we're fairly confident that the test
[SPEAKER_00]: is just going to come back as a positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not useful because of how much
powdery mildew he's already battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he has plants in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are more resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if powdery mildew is systemic or
interstitial, as you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: then by reusing those plants in the room
with new genetics, is he potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminating all of his new genetics and,
and just repeating the cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's kind of the way I'm looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if it is so that, and that's why I
said, so getting the powdery mildew test,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, you know, it is,
is important, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, um, you can, if you do it on the
leaf or, or bud, right, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you, if you do, let's say a,
a STEM, you know, you, you send us a STEM,
[SPEAKER_02]: a piece of STEM or STEM print in,
um, so theoretically that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the internal, you know,
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you see it in the leaf,
sorry, in a STEM, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: section, I would say that, you know,
it's interstitial.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you're looking at flower or
leaf, it's hard to tell if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interstitial, but if you look at the STEM
itself and a lot of these tests that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, you don't have to do it on
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do it on the,
on the, on the bud, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually do it on any piece of
plant that has DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the STEM, the root, anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so if you, if you were to be
concerned about whether it was
[SPEAKER_02]: interstitial or not, uh, or just surface,
you could send both a leaf and let's say a
[SPEAKER_02]: STEM, have them tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Independently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you get one, has it,
one doesn't, you know, you know where you
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of why I was saying it's
good to test your clones, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because clones in general, um,
you know, at that age, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see if you, if you see it on the clone
before you buy it, you shouldn't buy it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but you're not going to see it on
most clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do it on the clone,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is we, we wash the surface,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: On a clone so that, you know, anything
that it would have been just surface is
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, and then we look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the, you know, what's left,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and we recommend the same thing
to, to our customers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're looking to screen clones,
you take your clone, you, you dip it,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in a little alkaline water,
you know, and then do the leaf print after
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the DNA that's inside is the DNA
that's inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can tell what's inside.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wonder though, if some of these
environments, um, if because of the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of airborne spores pressure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will get, um, in an area,
you know, like up here in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, um, when we get those big
humidity fluctuations, we're pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing powdery mildew, you know,
whether we grow from seed or from,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, growing from clone outdoor
and indoor without a sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that, um,
you're going to battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just wondering if, if there's going
to be genetic markers for PM resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's where you were going,
I'm, I completely missed that question,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yes, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what we know about disease
resistance actually comes from other
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms, like a rabbit ops is then
brassica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so a rabbit ops is the sail crest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little cute little plant that doesn't
get more than a few inches tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, brassica is the family that gives us
things like cauliflower, um, Brussels
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouts, broccoli, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done a lot of work in those
organisms and we've actually gotten a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of disease resistance, understanding from
those organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not in, in a rabbit ops
is there's actually, there are trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: mutations in a rabbit ops is that cause
powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so we've actually gone down the path
of looking exactly for those genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I, when I, you know,
I said, we were going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at disease markers and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, um, stressors, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so what we've done is the,
the, the, the genes involved are called
[SPEAKER_02]: triticon and glabrous, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a few other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so when you look at mutations and
and those genes in rabbit ops is they
[SPEAKER_02]: cause, you know, a more or less
sensitivity to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've actually started to look for the
equivalent genes in cannabis to see
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not we can identify those genes
and then start to look at things like OG
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and LA confidential, which seemed to
be the extremes of powdery mildew ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: more resistant ones, more susceptible and,
and, and to start to look at things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see, and this gets back to what
I was saying earlier, how you have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: about doing these genetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to take one of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one doesn't give you any information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have the extremes of the
system so that you can find out where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where we are right now,
uh, looking at different strains that we
[SPEAKER_02]: know have different susceptibilities in
these various themes that we know from
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants are involved in powdery
mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're, you're still collecting
data on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, once you get a thousand
plants that all the growers all said had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good powdery mildew resistance,
you'll start to see similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can eventually develop a
marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of right now, what we have is,
you know, a marker for the organism that
[SPEAKER_02]: causes it, but we can tell you if it's
there, right now we're working on trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell you how to keep it from coming
through good breeding and good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would the same apply to botrytis or
bud rot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so every, you know, every organ is
going to have, um, you know, based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and some of these things may not
be, uh, specifically, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a trichome related.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may actually be some of these things
are related to the chemistry itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe there's a combination of terpenes
that is, uh, more detrimental to bud rot
[SPEAKER_02]: or botrytis and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and, you know, but try this is
interesting because the try this usually
[SPEAKER_02]: comes, um, along with predation from other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, caterpillars in particular,
when, you know, when caterpillars are
[SPEAKER_02]: eating your, your plant and they poop on
your plant, then wherever they've eaten
[SPEAKER_02]: and pooped is where you get to try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely either a link to the
caterpillar or there's a link to the
[SPEAKER_02]: wounding of the caterpillar, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it still has to be worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, and, but every single
one of these stresses or diseases or pests
[SPEAKER_02]: are, will be investigated because that's
the nature of agronomics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done all the same things and all
these other organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have genetically modified
corn and whatnot that is designed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to survive, uh, the use of certain
pesticides so that we can kill off the
[SPEAKER_02]: insects that are killing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, and we will,
we will, you know, obviously I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll ever get to that point in cannabis
because we, we have a different mindset in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not like big ag where pesticides,
you know, don't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, but I, I think you know,
people have to understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same kind of process,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time to be able to work some of
these things out because without being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to find, you know, a spectrum to look
at genetically, there's no way to go after
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these markers and tell you what it
is that's causing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of this work is kind of slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of what we get lucky and it falls out
because they've done it already in another
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can just take that and it
plugs right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis, unfortunately, you know,
we get some information but what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: found overall is that many of the gene
families that are present in other plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: while we find the gene families in
cannabis, we find that they are highly
[SPEAKER_02]: diverged in some cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a little bit slow going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, but I say that the low
hanging fruit, I'm not sure, but try this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I, I know we, we have a marker
to identify it, but try this, but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, but try this is one of those things
where until we understand the actual root
[SPEAKER_02]: of infection, it's hard to come up with a
marker, especially because if it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's carried by another organism,
then, um, then it, it's something more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to determine what is the
resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because it's not, it's not a direct
one to one correlation, unlike where
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew, it was a one-to-one
correlation, a defect in the trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: caused powdery mildew not to be able to,
to, to colonize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a one-to-one correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, what should I get excited
about on a test?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a test back from you guys,
like, uh, I, I know, I think it was you or
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the other people at Emerald cup on
that panel mentioned that mercy and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the dominant thing you guys were
seeing on all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you started seeing some other
genetic diversity show up on the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you discovered THC V what as
a grower, what should, what would make my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants stand out and be like, Hey,
this is something that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so right now, um, you know,
any plant that's making an abundance of a
[SPEAKER_02]: minor cannabinoid or making more than the
average minor cannabinoid, let's say THC
[SPEAKER_02]: V, you know, it exists at a point,
you know, 0.5% most places, German poison
[SPEAKER_02]: makes up the 2%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, uh, but that goes with CBC,
you know, CBG, any of the minor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, if you find, um,
you know, you pop a seed and you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you do a chemical test and something
like that pops up, or you find,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a minor terpene that is now very
abundant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you mentioned mercy and mercying,
uh, is dominant in almost two thirds of
[SPEAKER_02]: all cannabis strains, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So other one third of cannabis strains is
populated with alpha pining dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, limiting dominant, turpentine
dominance, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and so if you find strains that
are not mercying dominant, dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, or in one of those other,
um, you know, terpene categories,
[SPEAKER_02]: already you have found something a little
special, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a Jack Herrera special for a
reason, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it does, it's a turpentine
dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, and then, um, you know,
I guess it really depends on what the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator or breeders goal is,
but you know, if, if the goal is to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce better terpenes, and, or,
um, more cannabinoids, that's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a very, very important thing moving
forward, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all want, you know, more
cannabinoids, better yield of the
[SPEAKER_02]: important compounds from the least amount
of biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking for things that increase,
you know, if you find, if you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you pop a bunch of seeds and all of
them have a certain amount of biomass at
[SPEAKER_02]: week two, but you have one that's got like
four times the biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or two times the biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly there's a mutation there that is
increasing the overall vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: production, which means that overall
things are working better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the kinds of things that people
should be interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it looks different, if it smells
different, that's usually a good
[SPEAKER_02]: indication that you have something special
and that you should pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if, if it were me, I would be
excited for anything that doesn't look
[SPEAKER_02]: normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, be willing to do a
little chemical or genetic investigation
[SPEAKER_02]: to see why it doesn't look normal because
you don't know, you, you may have the next
[SPEAKER_02]: hot thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is exactly what happened with THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy came in, had a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was looking for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a cross, he did a self of
Harlequin, uh, for Doug, this is for
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug's Baron.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a self of Harlequin and then lo and
behold, a bunch of stuff was high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had one weird thing that was THCV
dominant, you know, to high THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and so, uh, because he did
come in and say, Hey, I want to know what
[SPEAKER_02]: my highest, you know, my, my highest,
you know, CBD producer is and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we ran an extended cannabinoid
profile from, and, and we were shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, told him about it and he was off to
the races.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I think, you know, it, it's
important to invest the time and money and
[SPEAKER_02]: energy into, I, into identifying things
that don't look like you expect,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's where the real diversity
and innovation is going to come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're all growing, you know,
platinum cookies, it's all going to look
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and if we're all looking for that
perfect bud, we're going to end up locked
[SPEAKER_02]: into genetics that don't change much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really those things that are the
outliers that lead us to new places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what excites me anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need growers to, to, if they do see
something unique to go ahead and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, looked at so that we can preserve
those genetics over time beyond just
[SPEAKER_00]: continually pulling cuttings off of a
mother plant and, and, and find out if it
[SPEAKER_00]: really is that special outlier,
like you found before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, Reggie, you know, I feel like I
can talk to you all day, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you so much for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you really kind of opened my eyes to a
lot of this potential of genetic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding better what the science
looks like behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not so intimidating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, again, anything new is
tends to be scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I completely get, you know,
some of the criticisms because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, we, we have been kind
of a shun society.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to go underground and now,
you know, um, now we have things that look
[SPEAKER_02]: like big ag being thrown in our face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, how do I know that
this is not really big, big ag in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very valid point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, the only thing I can
say to that is, you know, it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity and trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, and I just gave a
seminar in Baltimore a couple of days ago
[SPEAKER_02]: about how laboratories and producers tend
to be at odds with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and a lot of times it's because of
the way regulations are written or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, um, you know, a lack of explanation of
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I would encourage
anybody who's even, you know, close to
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about this, don't be afraid to
call up a lab and say, Hey, I want to know
[SPEAKER_02]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how much it costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, what does it,
you tell me what I get out of this and a,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a good laboratory with a good program
should be able to answer all those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can't, then you, you have your
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the right laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People definitely do their due diligence
around laboratories too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing, but that would be a whole nother
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it's a great talking to you and,
and thank you once again for letting me
[SPEAKER_02]: ramble on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I sign off, I want to tell you
about some bonus content at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: this track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chatted a bit more off air and I found
the content really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm including it at the end of this
podcast, but that was Dr. Reggie Gaudino
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank everyone who has
supported the podcast by leaving me a five
[SPEAKER_00]: star rating and review on whatever
platform you listen on or by supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: the Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also check out the website where I
put up a ton of information and also offer
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide variety of organic amendments,
soils, and other gardening products at www
[SPEAKER_00]: K I S organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now stay tuned for the bonus track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have one random question that I was
going to ask, but I didn't want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's so great about cookies from a
chemical perspective, it's a not fun plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a low producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's a terpene profile really,
uh, you know, cause it doesn't make,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't make any more THC than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it does have, it is very robust in
the terpene productions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies tends to be, you know,
two to 3% terpene content, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good for most homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: High THC producing strains these days,
a lot of high THC producing strains don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really make a lot of terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, but again, we,
we get into a cultivator thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've seen people who grow cookies
and they bring in them for testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got no terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dry as bone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, you know, there's definitely an
art to this whole thing about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and culture, I mean, and curing and
post harvest handling is as important as
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some people new to the
industry don't understand that,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, I'm just going to,
you know, I'm going to blast out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a hundred thousand square feet
of a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how was your bud going to come out,
you know, on the, on the post harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: side, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's a shame because I've seen
some really beautiful buds that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that had THC and not a lot of terpenes and
it didn't get me any higher than something
[SPEAKER_02]: that didn't look as good that had a lot of
terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so in my opinion, you know,
cookies is not that great a strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So both cookie fam and DJ short,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they both had a strategy where they
went after the weirdest looking shit or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, or the, or the finnickiest shit to go
after.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cookies does not grow well,
especially outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and, and here's the dirty secret
about our industry, Ted, the majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we find interesting would be
out competed in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the strains that we find really
good would probably not be very successful
[SPEAKER_02]: in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so we've created this kind of
weird, you know, industry where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, problematic, hard to grow and
process things are what we find is our,
[SPEAKER_02]: our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you look at things like,
you know, cookies, cookies, so blue drinks
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, some of these strains,
you're going to see fields and fields and
[SPEAKER_02]: fields of blue, of some of these strains,
but things like LA confidential cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to be able to,
you're not going to see a thousand acre
[SPEAKER_02]: field of that stuff being grown because
it's going to be really hard for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: get quality products like that because it
doesn't grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you seeing a difference across,
um, in terms of, uh, THC and turpentine
[SPEAKER_00]: expression across different methods of
growing, like, uh, we were a break per
[SPEAKER_00]: moment of outdoor living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we're seeing higher levels
of, of, uh, cannabinoids and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles with growers that are switching
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing that on your end too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see a lot of environmental
perturbation, the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, we have, we have clients
who did, you know, studies with just
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so, so interestingly enough,
some of the, of the larger, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation, you know, companies now are
doing a lot of decent science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so one of them that we work with
came in and said, okay, we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: optimize or grow, but we're going to start
with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to pick the best light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, you realize that if you
pick the best light now and you change
[SPEAKER_02]: your system later, you, you, you know,
you're growing other methodology that you
[SPEAKER_02]: may, um, you, you may end up seeing that
it wasn't the best light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, so you should be prepared for an
iterative process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find out what the best light was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were looking for something that
gave the best combination of Terps and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, which happens to be LED plus
UV, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did HPS, HPS plus UV, LED,
LED plus UV, same genetics, four different
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing they changed was the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got the data back and it was the
LED plus UV gave the best overall,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, median of both terpene and
cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, HPS by itself was highest peak,
um, uh, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: LED by itself was the highest peak
terpene, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and then, so then they took that
data, the LED plus UV, and now they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going back into their nutrients,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and, and living soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're doing that kind of work now,
but that's a lot of work and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's only really the larger
cultivators that are starting to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are seeing very interesting
differences and it is, it's the real thing
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my head too, I'm thinking of all
the method, methodology challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating a variable, you know,
across cultivars, across all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I could see where it would just
become a big mess and you could draw some
[SPEAKER_00]: broad conclusions for that facility,
but it would be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, and we're seeing better
terpene and cannabinoid expression in
[SPEAKER_00]: living soils because of those microbial
interactions, the plant and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the micro microbes in the soil are
really controlling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more than we can do with these
hydroponic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so since you're a living soil guy,
I'll give you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't published this data yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a, it's in a paper that we're
submitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to swear you to secrecy,
but you will get a kick out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is that we just did a terpene
RNA expression analysis for a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that allows us to do is to
look at the, uh, abundance of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, RNA produced for different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did it in a way that we looked at
it from a, um, a temporal and a spatial
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did, um, roots, uh, shoots,
leaves, tree flower, mid flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took the RNA from all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we saw was, um, that there are
about 10 terpenes that are expressed
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere but the root.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ha and it happens to be that
they're all mono terpenes with the
[SPEAKER_02]: exception of two, which were
sessquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the lighter, more volatile
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly these 10 terpenes are there
expressly for communication with the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is their job is to attract what is
good and repel what is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living soil is a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we already know that there in,
that there are chemicals that Canada's
[SPEAKER_02]: makes that is makes nowhere else but the
roots so that it must be involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: communication with the soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have you back on to talk about that
when you publish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't, uh, I'll, I'll delete all that
off the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's, I appreciate you sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've shown the preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a slide deck at a conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in fact, it was shown at that,
at that Colorado conference that I just
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically it has been released.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you actually probably could talk about,
you don't have to erase if you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could share this with listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, I'll, I'll edit up a little bit
of this last part of our conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it on as a little bonus part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure people will be really thrilled by
that.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, uh, thanks Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
