Welcome
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Cannabis Cultivation and Science
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Michael Brownbridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael is a biological program manager
with BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this role, he provides technical
support for the company's catalog of
[SPEAKER_02]: disease management products and their
utilization in integrated plant health
[SPEAKER_02]: programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to joining BioWorks in 2019,
he was fortunate enough to have traveled
[SPEAKER_02]: the world plying his craft with research
and outreach positions in Israel,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenya, the United States, New Zealand,
and Canada, putting new biological control
[SPEAKER_02]: tools and knowledge into the hands of
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Michael, thanks for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was finally able to make it to
have a chat with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept saying I thought we'd recorded this
podcast together because we've talked so
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really grateful for you coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to start off kind of just
taking a little bit different angle and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting since you are a pathologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry, let me back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you tell me a little bit about
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a recent pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth be told, Tad, I spend a lot of time
a lot of my career actually working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect control side of crop management and
transitioned into pathology because I
[SPEAKER_00]: firmly believe that when you're doing crop
production, you cannot look at just one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look at the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have pest issues, why do you
have pest issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do pest issues lead to disease issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an understanding of the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as my career progressed, it became less
just focused on insects and more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, taking an integrated approach to
crop management rather than pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management or disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently, as my
responsibilities have shifted,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken a more active role in plant
pathology and use of biologicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: control plant pathogens or manage plant
pathogens is probably a better way to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bit of a jack of all trades and
dangerous in a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I really enjoyed getting deeper
and deeper into the plant pathology world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not something I thought I might do
originally, but it's been a fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: journey and I'm enjoying it tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So given your background, how do you
approach a cultivation space?
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just use an indoor cultivation
space for this example.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you approach that from a
pathologist perspective and how does that
[SPEAKER_02]: differ, say, from like a grower or an
entomologist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think any time you enter a space,
it's always very tempting to hone in on
[SPEAKER_00]: something specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you have to take a couple of
moments really to just appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and I mean environment in the
broadest sense there, that you're walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding what's going on,
what sort of heating, lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation systems do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of watering systems do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of watering regime do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you water the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How tightly packed are the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on in a crop at any
given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant diseases typically don't just
appear because they feel like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's circumstances that result in that
disease manifesting itself on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sometimes can tell based on the
disease, but oftentimes say it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough air movement to keep
that air dry or the leaves dry that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of predispose plants to certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the medium overwatered?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's overwatered, again, that can
predispose the plant to certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the plants being fed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if I boil it down to a
sentence, it's coming into a room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciating how that plant is being grown
first and foremost, and then saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, let's go have a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's why I think it may be happening,
and here's how I think, here are some
[SPEAKER_00]: steps that I think will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're essentially trying to identify
all of the different variables that go
[SPEAKER_02]: into this plant's growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or overall health, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say all the variables, I think that
would be a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly the key variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you and many of your listeners
are familiar with the good old disease
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle, where there are basically three
primary things which control whether a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease will take or appear on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is environment, and
environment again in the broadest sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is that the disease has to
be present, that the infectious part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that disease has to be present at high
enough levels to be able to infect a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need virulent inoculum inside that
room, that greenhouse, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thirdly, you have to have a
susceptible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of factors will affect
all of those variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does environment mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can manage relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can manage that through good air
exchange, good air movement between the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, let's say, so you don't get
localized humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can manage the crop to a degree in
terms of which varieties we choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in cannabis, the varieties
that are grown are driven more by market
[SPEAKER_00]: than my choice for, say, a variety which
is more tolerant to certain diseases or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how else can we affect the plant and
its susceptibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is one thing, but the second part
is really how you grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, how you grow it, as I mentioned
earlier, overwatering, underwatering,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much of certain fertilizers,
too little fertilizers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you grow that plant matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can make that plant more or less
susceptible to the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third thing, do we have
sufficient infectious inoculum in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be influenced again by so many
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can bring that inoculum into the
greenhouse or the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be there in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come in on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a whole lot of variables
underneath each variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a good sense of that,
I think, makes you realize perhaps where
[SPEAKER_00]: to invest your time and energy in terms of
being able to prevent a disease or to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is important to take account
of as many of those variables as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, we can't do everything,
but we can, I think, have a good sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: what goes on and behave a little bit like
detectives to a degree to figure out of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these variables, which are the most
likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things can then help you narrow
down sometimes as to what disease it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some diseases are pretty self-evident,
particularly some of the foliar diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: that are prevalent in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the below ground diseases,
good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do understand certain conditions
which will make it easier for those
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases to occur, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think understanding a little
bit what drives disease occurrence helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having that, again,
understanding, you know the old saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand thine enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand your enemy, you can
understand how to prevent that enemy by
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what specific conditions
really promote its incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to take that type of
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with pests, you know, there's a
relationship between all of those plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and pest incidence too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, understanding the crop first is
probably one of the most important things
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assuming that we do have an issue,
a plant issue, I would guess the next step
[SPEAKER_02]: would be proper identification of that
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to have diseases identified
correctly because that can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how you go about controlling or
preventing that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a disease like powdery mildew,
it has quite characteristic symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: although you wouldn't necessarily be able
to identify the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the powdery mildew itself is not
one fungal species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a collection of fungal species that
have very similar symptoms on different
[SPEAKER_00]: host plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, you know, those white
fluffy growths on the foliage,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty likely to be powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get down below ground,
there are several diseases which can
[SPEAKER_00]: infect the roots and subsequently sort of
move up through the vascular system of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually determining which of those killed
the plant or made the plant sick is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always easy because they look very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes one disease can predispose
that plant to infection by another
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that second disease which
actually kills the plant or renders it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very, very sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important to get proper diagnosis
so you can understand how to, what steps
[SPEAKER_00]: to take against that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preliminary diagnoses may tell you some
very basic steps, like if you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: take the plant out, because you're not
gonna be able to save it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important to get a
diagnosis at some point in the procedure
[SPEAKER_00]: as well because it can also help identify
the source of that infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we know that, you know,
a lot of diseases can come into a grow via
[SPEAKER_00]: infected clones, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't really prove that if you
don't test or do a disease test to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes disease comes in on certain
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know that unless you test your
media or you test your plant for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a key piece of the puzzle,
not only from a treatment perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but looking ahead to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, where did it come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how can I prevent that happening
again in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's an important step.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how prevalent are a lot of these plant
diseases, like, you know, Pythium,
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium, powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I realize we can reduce pathogen
pressure, but is it really possible to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep those things completely out of a
facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is it more about managing
thresholds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or having a healthy, less stressed plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you, I guess, how do you
approach that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you hit the two nails,
let's say, on the head there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think a lot of these diseases are
often present, whether we like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes down to how do you keep
numbers low because diseases like pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants can tolerate low levels
of disease or maybe it's the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease that are present are not high
enough to actually infect the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the plant will be able to
withstand a certain level of challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: from a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where maintaining a healthy
plant is absolutely essential,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing the plant, not forcing the plant
too much, making sure it has what it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: when it needs it, rather than trying to
sort of force feed it or grow it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: swamp where it should be grown dry or
drier, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that plant to be as healthy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also important to take very
seriously, you know, before you even start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We oftentimes, when we talk, we say,
you know, sanitation first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanitation is so, so important by way of
the area of growing the plant in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanitation by how, say, workers come in
and work in a certain space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an area where there's a known
degree of infection, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: or pests for that matter, then don't go
there first, go there last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into the clean rooms where the crops
are still clean first, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your water clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your water full of disease because of
where you're pulling that water supply
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had water tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of steps can be taken
right from the get-go to ensure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that plant in the best and
cleanest environment that you can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes to sort of knowing the
plant material, not just buying
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the cheapest or what's
available, but I think having a good
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted supply for say, if you're buying
in clones rather than doing them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of benefits to growing plants
or at least mother plants from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, tissue cultured material because,
you know, there's a very high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: certainty that those tissue cultured
plantlets are going to be free of disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, using disease-free stock as your
starting point is going to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: potential ingress of a lot of pathogens to
these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we live in a world which
has got a lot of microbes floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air, in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to us to try our best to
eliminate them as best as we can from a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room and create a growing environment
which favors the plant as much as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: and provides the plant with what it needs
to grow healthily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And robustly and, you know, it's just like
us, the better we eat, the better we sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: and look after ourselves, the more likely
we are to be able to resist certain
[SPEAKER_00]: infections or at least we recover faster
from those infections if they occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, I would say we can
tolerate a certain level of infection
[SPEAKER_00]: without falling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good place to be if we had to
take certain steps to mitigate that
[SPEAKER_00]: disease and use, you know, control
products to basically knock back the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pressure, to knock back inoculum
levels and prevent it spreading sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: from one plant to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's a lot we can do to equip
plants very, very well to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: resist diseases too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's testing available,
like we offer testing for viruses like
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplite and viroid and, you know,
alfalfa, cucumber, tobacco mosaic,
[SPEAKER_02]: those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know those testing kits exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the average grower, where do we
find out if our plant has pythium or
[SPEAKER_02]: fusarium, for example, or some of these
other fairly common diseases?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of pathology labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any resources that are widely
available across the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that university extension
systems would be able to provide those
[SPEAKER_00]: services often for a fee, but they would
provide those identification services with
[SPEAKER_00]: the sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I just realized I asked a
Canadian, where do I find pathology labs
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realize it's probably not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same issues here, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's a North American
challenge sometimes is being able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a state which has an
agricultural, you know, most states have
[SPEAKER_00]: an agricultural or a land-grant university
which has some degree of extension
[SPEAKER_00]: services attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the best place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think increasingly, and I'll speak
for, I live in Ontario in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, and there are at least three
testing labs that I know of where I could
[SPEAKER_00]: send plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all done for a fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fee based service, but there are
those diagnostic facilities that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect but I don't know for a fact that
there should be those diagnostic labs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily within every state,
but somewhere within a sort of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to cluster all these states in
the Pacific Northwest, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, I'm sure there's a commercial
testing lab where you can send material
[SPEAKER_00]: for testing and get a definitive answer on
what's infecting your plant within a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching crops for a second, you know,
I know a lot of vegetable growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario will actually send samples over to
the Netherlands for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole, you know, that's a whole
different undertaking, but if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing available in your state,
then I would say, you know, cast a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: net and just see which testing labs may be
accessible to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assuming we're talking about some sort
of vascular root disease like Pythium or
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium, getting back to those two,
how different is your treatment approach
[SPEAKER_02]: for those two diseases?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the plant a goner at that point since
they are vascular diseases?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it better to just remove it and then
are there ways to treat the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realize that was a few different
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say once you've got the
disease in the vascular system and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you've probably seen the classic
pictures of plants where if you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: slice along the stem of the plant,
it's starting to go brown inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good indication that the
disease has developed up through that
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not worth investing a whole
lot of time and resources trying to save
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cheaper probably to just get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do two things in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's removed as a headache for you to
try and look after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chances, like I say, of actually
getting anything out of it are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very low at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, you know, the longer you
keep that plant around, the higher the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood that it can serve as a source
of infection for the plants in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best thing to do is is not wait until you
see plants that are infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say is to, again, know your enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have sources of infection by water,
by clones, by soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the risks posed by all of those
things in terms of is there a likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: that there may be some infection there
that you're dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we just go ahead and assume that you
know, I'm working in an environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's highly likely that at some point
there will be disease present.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking cannabis particularly,
it's not a crop where we have really any
[SPEAKER_00]: real curative products available to us
that like in, if you use a comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: say outdoor agriculture, you know,
where there's a lot of synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries or synthetic products
available where you can see a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can spray it with chemistry and that
takes care of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the prevention game because we
have access to materials that really rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on us preventing the disease issues
happening, preventing infection taking
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of that plant and protecting the
plant against disease as best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, you know, there's a number of
products that can do that and they're best
[SPEAKER_00]: used in a production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we kind of touched on best
cultural practices for the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got good cultural practices
in place, your plant's gonna be better
[SPEAKER_00]: equipped to sort of handle itself and deal
with any disease challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the situation you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a healthy plant that we can then
layer on top of that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: biological materials to further mitigate
the risk or eliminate the risk of diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are, we're playing a
preventative game here by how we approach
[SPEAKER_00]: disease management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are some of the tools in the
gardener's arsenal when we, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we maybe have to deal with some of
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if I start with the soil,
it's probably a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are various microbial biofungicides
based on fungi like trichoderma or
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, various bacillus
species which can be really used
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively, both the trichoderma and the
bacillus species work extremely well in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of preventing and preventative
control agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacillus sometimes, certainly if
you're using them for foliar diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a little bit of a curative
property just based on the nature of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're ideally talking a
preventative game here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, bacterial fungal products
would be those of choice for me in that
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: streptomyces, let's say products,
which I think are registered in some
[SPEAKER_00]: states for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same type of scenario is applying those
early in that cropping cycle so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: work as to prevent diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should back up a couple of steps,
Tad, and talk about the growing medium
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we frequently just talk about dirt
or, you know, potting mixes, but having a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy microbial biota in there as well
is an important part of, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whatever we can do to promote good
microbes versus bad is going to go a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way to help that plant flourish in that
environment because there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants and microbes have had
associations for thousands, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: since the beginning, I guess, just like we
really could not survive without microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the plants really can't survive
without those microbes either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form very close associations with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different microbes have different
functions in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very good, some microbes not so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to try and shift the balance
of the soil, and I'm in no way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, or form an expert on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be much better positioned to
talk about this than I would, but I firmly
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in, you know, healthy soils are
part of the solution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we go then to what are some of
the control products we can use is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at a certain point, you can do
everything correct culturally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the disease pressures are higher than
those cultural practices can necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that disease taking hold,
and that's where we're then bringing these
[SPEAKER_00]: additional beneficial microbes to work
within that system to further prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, and these are microbes which have
been specifically selected because of
[SPEAKER_00]: their disease-suppressive properties,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know that, you know, by
introducing them, they will perform that
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's a very high level looking at
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that sort of is my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say trichoderma or bacillus,
like you're acknowledging that that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty wide range of actual species and
efficacy, and then now when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing and products, it gets even more
confusing, and then you add in shelf life
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these other things and spore
counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really hard for the
cultivator or the end user to really know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's best, because I can go online and
find a paper on trichoderma suppressing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, various pathogens, but how do I
know that the product that I'm buying is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have any efficacy whatsoever,
or what is even the best product for what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question,
and how long have we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about it for quite a while,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying trichoderma and just saying
bacillus, just saying streptomyces doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pick on trichoderma, but you could
say pretty much equally the same for
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichoderma is one of the most widely
distributed organisms throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can find trichoderma fungi
in pretty well every environment you look
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perform different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different trichoderma species do different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just saying I have a trichoderma does
not necessarily mean you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma that can suppress a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, simply saying I have a bacillus
does not necessarily mean you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of bacillus or streptomyces,
if we're talking bacteria, that is capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of suppressing diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bacilli perform other functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other functions in the environment,
as do trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some workers, you know, decomposes or they
can work together with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't actually do any disease
control, but they will perhaps solubilize
[SPEAKER_00]: certain elements in the soil or predigest
organic matter and then make the products,
[SPEAKER_00]: the breakdown products are then made
available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different organisms have different
functions inside that whole biota that we
[SPEAKER_00]: call a living soil, if you would like to
call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get to, you know, what do I look for
now in a disease control product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe, you know, that products
per se that are registered and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: registered with the EPA, registered with
the PMRA, and Canada, those products have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through a lot of testing and in
order to be considered as biopesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you make any disease management
claims on a label, it has to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: registered product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get registered,
there is a lot of prerequisites in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of filing a portfolio of data on the
safety and efficacy of those particular
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes to the respective regulatory
authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, choosing a registered product is,
I think, one way of safeguarding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your investment to some degree
that you know what's in that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has had to have been tested,
you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is written on the side of the bag,
it says, contains one times ten to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seven CFUs per gram, or one times ten to
the nine per gram, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a registered product, you have to
conform to what is written on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is written on the label as a
manufacturer, the manufacturer has to
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee that what is in that bag
contains what it says it contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means product purity,
so if it said, you know, contains one
[SPEAKER_00]: times ten to the seven CFUs, trichoderma,
heart, cyanum, at least per gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also guarantees that there's a
minimal amount of other microbes in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are very strict guidelines from
both the EPA and the PMRA about acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of contaminants, and it's very,
very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get a product registered,
you have to go through a lot, or jump
[SPEAKER_00]: across a lot of hurdles, go through a lot
of hoops, however you want to word it,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get that product registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what it does, as I said,
it sort of is a guarantee for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purchaser of that product that it contains
what it says it does, and it will do the
[SPEAKER_00]: job that is stated on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's a lot of
unregistered products which are sold as,
[SPEAKER_00]: or plant growth enhances, or, I don't
know, plant growth enhances is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: one I can think of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may or may not contain the microbes
that it says on the sheet, or may contain
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly fewer microbes that it says
in the literature that you might accompany
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because a package says it contains
a product doesn't mean it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: living.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it actually contains
spores of that product at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tests that I know you're familiar with
some of the work that I've been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in previously is looking at some of these
sort of unregistered materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's quite scary actually what you
find inside them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also quite scary, the flip side,
that it says it contains 10 to the 7 of a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific fungus, let's say, and it
actually doesn't contain anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: living inside it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think you're on a good thing,
it contains trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, understand that there is a reason why
certain strains have been commercialized,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not just any old trichoderma,
or bacillus, or streptomyces that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into a commercial product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have met certain performance
standards, they have to have met certain
[SPEAKER_00]: production standards in terms of producing
that consistent level of the microbe that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into that product, the jug or the
bag, and there's a certain safety
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with that product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen examined products, and some of
the organisms that come out of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually things like aspergillus,
penicillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, certain aspergillus can be very,
they're human pathogens, you really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be spraying that into your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're talking a crop like
cannabis, if you think I'm doing a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing here, and you're spraying on
penicillium or aspergillus, you're setting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for failure when those flowers
go for the total yield yeast and mold
[SPEAKER_00]: count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're just putting spoilage
microbes, contaminant microbes out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you it'd probably take a good hour
to talk this one properly through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are risks associated with just
buying any product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is inherent upon the buyer to do
a little bit of homework around the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, and make sure what you're buying
is registered, has a good track record,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if in doubt, if somebody knocks on
your door and says, hey, I've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing in some unmarked bags out here,
you want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, always, always ask to see some
data supporting the claims that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: made on the label or by the person selling
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That oftentimes sorts out the good from
the bad or the weak from the chaff,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you want to phrase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to navigate sometimes,
and it really is inherent upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, I think, to do a little bit of
checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if in doubt, call the companies and
ask for some of these details we've just
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know this was a pretty hot topic
at the latest BioSolutions Conference,
[SPEAKER_02]: because as the industry is trying to gain
legitimacy for biofungicides, for
[SPEAKER_02]: biostimulants, all of using microbes
commercially in agriculture, you have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these products out there that are
essentially either ineffective or making
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong claims or skirting registration and
that are painting a bad name for the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And correct me if I'm wrong, I believe
Suzanne got a sample from one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest companies in my part of the living
soil portion industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you tested it and found it didn't
contain enough spores to have any
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another sample, we actually found no
living Bavaria in the product at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're pretty particular about how we
ran these tests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you run a test once and nothing shows
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always doubt the results, so you make
sure you run it again and then run it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third time just to just to triple
check the validity of the data that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it wasn't just a fluke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, these are Suzanne found
the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the testing for her and found
nothing in it or nothing in it of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, but yet if you went on the
reviews for that product on the product
[SPEAKER_02]: page, you'd see positive reviews and you'd
see on Instagram a lot of reviews that are
[SPEAKER_02]: positive, but yet the efficacy isn't
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we have to separate out
actual like science and data from
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also, I had heard, found another
product that had on their label,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I believe it was Bavaria again,
levels so high that it wasn't it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: physically, physiologically possible to
have that sort of volume in the counting
[SPEAKER_02]: or spore count in a volume, an amount of
volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a it was a it was a it was a mix of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if if it contained everything that it
said on the label, you could not fit all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those spores into a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just physically impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but again, the claim was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we indeed tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the claim was there's
something like 10 billion or 100 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: spores per per gram, I think it was and we
we got some samples, plated them,
[SPEAKER_00]: did the counts, and then you do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, you know, something like a
10,000 times less lower level of
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things that we could get out of
it were bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So presumably a bacillus, we found no,
no fungi in the product at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we throw things word,
we throw words around like penicillium and
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium, and we think they're all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: In actual fact, that's not the case,
you know, just to clarify this or get it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, 95% of the
penicillium and fusarium strains you find
[SPEAKER_00]: in in a typical soil sample are actually
very, very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, some I know some some
penicillium strains have been
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialized because they actually
solubilize soil nutrients very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very efficiently, and can make them more
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just just saying
penicillium or fusarium doesn't doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: hold a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gets back to an earlier
question that it's important to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: species, because some species,
even though it has that genus,
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium or penicillium, the actual
species can be totally harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but again, back, back to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's ridiculous what people
put on the side of a side of a label
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I question why put so many
organisms in there, because many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms do exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those organisms live in exactly
the same niches, either on the plant root
[SPEAKER_00]: or close to the plant root or in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't all colonize at the same time
at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, all soils are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are very dynamic, they will evolve
through the life of a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's what microbe is predominant
today may not be the predominant microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I sometimes question the
value of putting, you know, 20 different
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes in a mix, unless they're just
trying to cover all the bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially as you know, some of the
functions that those microbes have will
[SPEAKER_00]: only really happen if those microbes
establish and form an association at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by certain level, I mean, the
microbial population size has to be at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level to actually do any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a, it's a very gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some excellent products out
there, microbial products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some excellent bio stimulants
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for every good one you have,
I would say there's probably two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: dubious ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, which sound great, but don't
actually do a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say registered, I want to
just make sure people realize that's EPA
[SPEAKER_02]: registration, not state registration.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big difference there in terms of
like, I want to register.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna say if I wanted to
register a product in Washington state or
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon or California, for example,
that's very easy process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to show it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to show any efficacy,
especially, you know, I don't know if 25B
[SPEAKER_02]: applies to microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's a little more complex
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the states will only register
products if they have EPA registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is products making pesticide
claims.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't make any claims around
it, then you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't make any claims, you can
probably go in and you still have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: state registration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25Bs are a great example, I think,
in that people look at 25Bs as
[SPEAKER_00]: unregistered products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually EPA approved because the
EPA says we're categorizing this as a 25B
[SPEAKER_00]: because based on the information we have,
we don't think it poses any risk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or to human, animal or plant
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you do not need to go through a
lot of the EPA regulatory requirements to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that product approved for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's categorized as 25B, which is an
EPA categorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those still have to be registered at
the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a certain level of
responsibility and accountability in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that product approved for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the state level, cannabis then
typically has an additional layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements to go through to get products
approved for use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process will differ depending on,
as you rightly said, the claims that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being made on the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not making any pest or disease
management claims, but you're registering
[SPEAKER_00]: it for the plant benefit claims,
then it's a different process altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get emails all the time from Chinese
companies that are selling various species
[SPEAKER_02]: of bacillus and trichoderma and all of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could very easily today go online,
make a mix and sell it without having any
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy data showing that one,
that's actually what I'm saying is that
[SPEAKER_02]: the product is better than the product or
two that it even works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what I think a lot of companies
do, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was another product that Suzanne
found and it was being sold, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: on Etsy or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these products on Amazon and
Etsy and goodness knows where else.
[SPEAKER_00]: She sent us a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposedly a metarysium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, metarysium is typically associated
with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an insect control fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's some great products out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these barrels of metarysium,
I think it was anisoplea, was apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in and very cheap, very cheap,
sold in from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was one of those products we
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was absolutely no living metarysium
in the product or in that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hesitate to use the word product because
it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to think as well,
there's a lot more goes into a bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: product than just spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole lot of stabilization which
keep those spores alive over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of relates to your earlier
question about shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way in which those spores are
preserved and formulated affects how
[SPEAKER_00]: stable they are and how long they will
remain alive and therefore effective when
[SPEAKER_00]: you store them either in the fridge or at
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any formulation, back up on that one,
formulations often as well contain
[SPEAKER_00]: additional materials which help the grower
then put that material, if it's a microbe,
[SPEAKER_00]: or putting it into the spray tank or into
whatever they're using, whatever equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using, it helps that process of
getting those spores into suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it helps them stay in suspension
and it helps that product when it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: gets onto the leaf or targets the pest,
it'll help it work better and remain
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for longer in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more to a product than
just say getting a bag full of spores from
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's why registered products
have made the investment in coming up with
[SPEAKER_00]: a formulation that is stable, that will
preserve the viability of those microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: and will help at the application end in
terms of preparation and application and
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes improve efficacy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a lot we could talk about
in this whole area for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I would just add, you know,
that they're going to be clean too or
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner in terms of heavy metal
contaminants and things like that that
[SPEAKER_02]: could also cause issues, especially in
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to conform to, again,
that's one of the requirements of any
[SPEAKER_00]: registered products that you, I mentioned
the contaminants, I was kind of referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to microbial contaminants, but it also
applies to heavy metals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to fall under EPA
prescribed levels of any heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_00]: any product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also another guarantee around
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from offshore and they're
making claims on it, number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually illegal to use it because
it's not registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, you have no idea what
you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the problem with that though is
like, unfortunately, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, again, a lot of the companies
that do quite well and sell, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of dollars worth of product every
year that have not gone through the step
[SPEAKER_02]: of registering their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I do blame them,
but I also kind of blame this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: the states for making it so difficult to
have to register in 50 states is frankly
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should have some sort of
federal registration, but there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: really accountability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the state of Oregon, you know,
you have companies that will continually
[SPEAKER_02]: not register or their products don't
contain what they claim they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might pay $150 fine or $1,000
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if you're doing $10
million in that state, do you really care?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not, the financial incentive is
not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to discourage or eliminate a lot
of these, a lot of these products either,
[SPEAKER_02]: because like on my side, you know,
in the living soil industry, one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest competitors has gone by without
registering for years and is now just
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to register their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they've known that this is
something that you're supposed to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no incentive for them to do it
because it costs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires more regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a frustrating topic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is frustrating, but yeah, it's cheaper
to pay the fine than to actually pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: registration costs, not just the
registration costs, but you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: data, you know, which is a cost and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, frustrating, but I tend to think
that, or I would like to think in an ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: world, registration means something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get a little bit smarter
perhaps about the processes required to
[SPEAKER_00]: register a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having one federal registration would
be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would save a heck of a lot of
time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think again, you know,
registered products, it can be registered
[SPEAKER_00]: and still not work because there are a
whole lot of other factors around making a
[SPEAKER_00]: product work effectively when you apply
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least you know what you're buying
is what it says it is and has a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of doing what it says it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it says it will do, what it says or
what the vendor promises it will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to think it was, again,
it's incumbent upon people to really take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at what they're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you getting value for money there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting, are you sure the
product's doing what is said on the label
[SPEAKER_00]: or advertising literature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it doing what it says it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always an interesting conversation to
have with how do you know the product's
[SPEAKER_00]: worked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because things look greener, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a true measure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I'm being somewhat flippant
there, but I think having a good idea in
[SPEAKER_00]: your own mind, what does success look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use this product, what am I,
what do I want this product to do number
[SPEAKER_00]: one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how will I be able to measure that to
sort of say pretty darn equivocally that
[SPEAKER_00]: the product's done, you know, what I
wanted it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always easy to do either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the flip side, like I, at this
conference that we were both at,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were companies, you know,
including Bioworks, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this product that's coming,
you know, and you're not talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: matter of days and weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more on the scale of month to year
because, or years, because of the amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of research that has to go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then not just that research,
but then, you know, the registration
[SPEAKER_02]: process in all these states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even once you have the data,
there's still that waiting period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to me is one of the most
frustrating things about the regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: process is that, you know, you've got it,
you've got this product that you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution and you just can't get it out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still, I'm fully supportive of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, almost equate it to like
the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not going to go get your
antibiotics from the farmer's market or
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy in the alley if you want them to
know that they're actually going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you go to the doctor and that's the
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that extreme almost between regulated
products and the unreliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unregulated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, putting my company hat
on now, I mean, it is very frustrating at
[SPEAKER_00]: times, the amount of time it does take
from submission of a registration package
[SPEAKER_00]: to actual approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it does take months to years for
that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a shame we haven't figured out to
make things move along faster there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but oh well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all bound to go through the same
system, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one last thing I kind of wanted to
touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I started this conversation in
Reno at the conference talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a complex topic, this idea of in
soils, or, you know, in my case with
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils, so soil is media that we're
reusing and treating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like soils, we have this microbial
consortium that's constantly co-evolving
[SPEAKER_02]: with our cannabis plants and changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts around?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we ever really fully understand
this process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we ever really fully quantify or
understand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golly, what a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Nobel Prize stuff if we answer
this one, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, for sure, you know, plants don't
stay the same, of course, throughout their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at certain times of that plant growth,
those roots, if we're talking about soil
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, those roots will exude
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those compounds, like sugars,
fava, association of certain microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain sugars, certain microbes,
sometimes when plants are stressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, they will put out different
chemicals to try and recruit in other
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At other times of the plant's development,
you know, as it gets older, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: those exudates will change slightly,
and the microbial population in and around
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil will change slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if it's a true living soil as
well, you have to understand that the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is constantly changing,
let alone what's going on with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil itself will be changing
because there's always organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in different states of decay
inside the soil, and there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: successions of microbes will come in and
take advantage of certain elements that
[SPEAKER_00]: are released from that organic material
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a constantly evolving and
changing microbial landscape in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we ever fully understand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think we can understand
it to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe by having certain microbes in a
certain place at a certain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: golly, it's difficult to sort of say
because the plant needs some microbes at
[SPEAKER_00]: some time, other microbes at other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we try and ensure that those
microbes are present as and when the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't answered your question at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've danced around it very, very neatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think there's an answer per se
to it that I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we will, over time, develop a
better understanding of what goes on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what some of these
studies have done, you know, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using these wonderful microarrays to
identify different microbes and the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of their presence at different times
through the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mistake would be to take one
sample and say, look at all the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found and say, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the plant needs now and
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to understand that things
change and that microbial population will
[SPEAKER_00]: change over time as well and be okay with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then by using some of the new tools
that we have, we can get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have that understanding and then
maybe we get to a point to sort of say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, at this time, the plant typically
needs microbes, you know, X, Y and Z or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what can we do to promote these
microbes at this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then change perhaps a feed in the soil
to encourage other microbes to be present
[SPEAKER_00]: at another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's incredibly complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as humans, we try and simplify it as
best we can and come up with a very sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of simple answer to a very complex
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you could probably spend a
lifetime investigating that and still not
[SPEAKER_00]: have the right answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I find it absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beautiful question, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess I asked this in the
context of the idea that we have knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: that the microbial life in soil is
constantly evolving, constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully selecting for microorganisms
that are going to be more beneficial for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant as that plant is continually
putting out exudates to support those sets
[SPEAKER_02]: of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess for me, it almost feels too
derivative to try and a reductionist to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and make any assumptions around
microbial life other than to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, we're dealing with this problem and
we know that these species can... There's
[SPEAKER_02]: research supporting trichoderma battles,
these problems, or mycorrhizal fungi help
[SPEAKER_02]: with this update.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's targeted things I feel
comfortable saying we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a general rule, looking at fungal
to bacteria ratios or entire sets of
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms, that's where it feels like it's
like the forest through the trees almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain key organisms we can
hone in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that to your reference there,
certain trichoderma species for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: control, they will also help the plant,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae, bacillus species,
we know that they're pretty tough
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that will establish and grow in
a wide range of soil types, a wide range
[SPEAKER_00]: of pH values, and a form of associations
with a wide range of crop species or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species, better put.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those are, again, ones we can
sort of look to and perhaps count on to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in their A game every single time
you use them pretty well, rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand what the heck's going
on with that whole microbial ecology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and somehow control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that just popped
into my head as well is every single
[SPEAKER_00]: organism we've talked about, including
plants, the beneficial ones especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how else can you affect the microbial
community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on how much water you put
into a plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will affect the plant and will affect
the microbial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of, it goes back to
what I was touching on earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: what role does environment play in all of
these associations as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adds an extra layer of complexity
to any evaluation or to any study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to sort of bring it down to
simplify it somewhat and back to your
[SPEAKER_00]: point, I think, yes, there are certain key
microbes we know will perform well,
[SPEAKER_00]: will consistently establish and form those
beneficial associations with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are things from a, perhaps from
a disease management perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that we can pretty well hang our hats
on and say, we know this works and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the data to show it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, so last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna throw you a curve ball here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen this for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it wasn't that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think how to phrase this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see a lot of people on social media
or coming from the compost tea industry
[SPEAKER_02]: where when you add a food source,
let's say alfalfa meal or oat flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get a growth on the surface,
sort of a white fuzzy mold growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people show this as it being
beneficial or probiotic or a sign of good
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, what is the fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee I can throw anything like that
in my garden and within a matter of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be white and fluffy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's a beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means there's a fungus there which
can utilize that, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a food source and proliferates on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a false measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no evidence that it has any
sort of plant or soil benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could very well be innocuous,
probably not harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be totally innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is full of all sorts of microbes
which just hang out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They derive food from a wide variety of
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are just decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may form associations with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others might form associations with
arthropods which live in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just happened to be there and went to
be ingested by an arthropod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to get something white and fluffy
growing on a alfalfa powder or oatmeal
[SPEAKER_00]: powder doesn't prove a darn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that will make people think a
little more critically about some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: photos I see on social media.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of thought and
passion put into a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not doubting the good intent behind
a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to be a little bit
more discerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or scientific in how we actually say this
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this is a sign of something really good
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And discerning is a good word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's white and fluffy doesn't
make it a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, botrytis can be white and
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As can fusarium be white and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As can penicillium be white and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we got good or we got bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it doesn't really answer the
question, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a fungus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all you can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know what that fungus is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue this conversation next time
we meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your time today.

you again soon.
