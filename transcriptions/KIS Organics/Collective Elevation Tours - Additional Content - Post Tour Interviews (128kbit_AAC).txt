[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Adam Arnold, Collective Elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Bozeman, Montana, is where we're
based out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dispensaries are in Butte,
Billings, Missoula, and Bozeman as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about Collective Elevation,
since this is your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was all founded from being
passionate about growing cannabis since
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially I was a little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so initially what happened when
Montana started allowing legal medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, I purchased a farm that was
completely off grid out in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere and went with hybrid, just
basically hoop house facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just running one or pulling tarp
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business partner, Carl, at the same
time was an indoor fully hydro salt based
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of a couple of years,
we were just friends at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years, we saw that one of us
was doing significantly better on our
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, just profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one was and then still
getting winners off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we saw the potential of living soil
and what it does for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with the off grid facility,
even though it was extremely sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: was you had to make up for that with a ton
of work, stoking wood stoves, carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: water, just a lot of the tea tanks were
trash cans and carrying five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets, 100 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was so many inefficiencies in
that off grid style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And waking up at 3 a.m., stoking these
wood stoves, I was always dreaming of,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, what if I could see this on my phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I had a greenhouse that could run
all winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sparked what is the modern
iteration of our current farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as 2017 legislation pretty much
cemented the cannabis industry in Montana
[SPEAKER_00]: as being around to stay and not subject to
shut down in lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time we could really
invest in anything more than a rental
[SPEAKER_00]: because we didn't know that if it wouldn't
get shut down entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it started in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started building this out and we built
it out in about four different phases,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning as we went and just always trying
to troubleshoot and evolve to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: best, most efficient system we possibly
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the biggest, as far as I know,
grow facility in Montana and let alone
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all evolved from both seeing the
potential of plant health, the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started winning cannabis cups in
Montana really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that living soil was outpacing
our hydro at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, you take into account
cost effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the labor, the initial soils in
the labor savings alone, all the dots were
[SPEAKER_00]: finally just pretty connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was apparent over a series of years
that this style has chops for both
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so rare in life that you get a win,
win, win.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better for the people, better for
the planet, cheaper to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not really a thing that happens
in business very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually one of those things has to be
sacrificed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stumbled upon something and we've
just kind of been running with it ever
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though you're organic,
that's that's almost just a perk on the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial scale because of the you're
finding it's actually cheaper,
[SPEAKER_03]: less labor and has all these other
commercial benefits on scale that make it
[SPEAKER_03]: worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And organics is well, that may be
something you're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's sort of like an added bonus on
top of all the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we can if we can be more
sustainable than everyone else,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that is a core premise of our mission
statement as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, so that was actually why
we started down this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just realized that there was these
secondary benefits of of also a better
[SPEAKER_00]: product that turned out to be cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few other things that happened
to us like our local growth store shutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we've had sparked us to getting
trailer load, you know, filling up semi
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks worth of amendments and doing it
once a year and planning ahead and just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to scale in every way that we
possibly could before the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry gets to that level, beating them
to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me and tell me your name and your
role here at Collectibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Danny James.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the facility manager slash
cultivation director.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, I do most of facility
maintenance design, you know, do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the construction and, you know,
figuring out how new systems can be
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented or to make things more
efficient and better for the company as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you wear a ton of hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of saw so many hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dabble in, you know, minor electrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all the plumbing for irrigation
systems, tank setups, pH injection
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do fabricating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do jack of all trades,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, were you a grower before you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have been cultivating cannabis for
about eight, nine years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started off growing in a four car garage
for a local dispensary and that plants
[SPEAKER_01]: were on cinder blocks and plastic trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since after that, I went to a cocoa
hydro setup with the dispensary here in
[SPEAKER_01]: town, Spark One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I learned a majority of my
cultivation practices and why not through
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so it was a very different
transition coming from a super sterile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, plant environment using cocoa
substrate, hydroponics, salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mixing up batch tanks and then
coming to like the whole living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of organic, you know,
way of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a fun transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I could ever go back to
growing in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last question, I'm super interested in
the Unistrut tray table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I need that in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I will have to draw you up some
plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you welding the Unistruts?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trays that you were interested in
for our mother room that all of our two
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four beds are on, those were not
welded together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make universal kind of brackets that
you can bolt together all of the Unistrut
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of make, you know, whatever shape
and length and width you would want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, just using the
casters, you know, if you get a the right
[SPEAKER_01]: size caster that is, you know,
can withstand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the casters on those trays were
about 350, 450 pounds per wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do, you know, a wheel on each
corner and then two in the center of a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four by tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can support a lot of that center
weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of really cool innovation
that I see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of my, that's my,
my forte is that I love, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: both of my parents are engineers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, and I didn't necessarily go
to school for engineering, but I have that
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset of like looking at things in a
different way and seeing how I can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish certain things on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me a little bit about,
about yourself and what your role is here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm our, one of our cultivation guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing most of our fertilizer
management, nutrient management,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of our irrigation stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of monitoring all of our
greenhouses, like throughout a daily basis
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff, and just working amongst the
other crews and everything, kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just toured the facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I'll share some video of that and we
can look at the irrigation and things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but tell me a little bit about your,
your process for maintaining the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, every run we're testing a little
bit before harvest, kind of making our
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments based off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking, kind of trying to see what we're
deficient in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting together a good like fertilizer
plan that's going to meet our needs while
[SPEAKER_02]: not giving us too much surplus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to be wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of meeting our needs, getting into
too much surplus within our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of monitoring post of our,
post our first amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially throughout kind of our veg
time, just monitoring our plants for like
[SPEAKER_02]: their nitrogen needs and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some foliar testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we feel like we got something going on
for the most part, our soil testing is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of our good standard go-to to kind of
check out what we got going on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, we're using dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to use those over like kind of
liquid feeding at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really have any liquid feeds,
but for the most part, dry amendments
[SPEAKER_02]: usually kind of mixed in to the first,
like six inches or so of our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the standard kind of organic
products, we're trying to use a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're using a lot of like fish meal,
some fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use like gypsum, sulfate, potash,
kind of all the.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're addressing any fertility
things that come up with peas or liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we do have any like kind of,
for the most part, we've been lucky lately
[SPEAKER_02]: to where we've been getting into a groove
where we haven't necessarily seen as many
[SPEAKER_02]: like kind of later growth deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing a good job of kind of
getting to our nitrogen needs early and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, and same with our other
nutrient needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we do run into those issues,
we're doing some top dressing or some like
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid feeding through like our micro-tees
where we'll put, if we're looking like
[SPEAKER_02]: we're nitrogen deficient, we'll use like
some fish hydrolysate within those,
[SPEAKER_02]: those teas, or we can do some like
nutrient soaks as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for the most part, we're trying
to kind of cover our bases earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way we're not running into those
issues where by the time you're seeing it
[SPEAKER_02]: into the plant, it's been a few weeks or
it's been a week or so already that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of trying to preemptively take
care of those issues rather than wait and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing them and then responding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
