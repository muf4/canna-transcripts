[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: science-based perspective and drawing top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_03]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guest this week is Rufus Akinrinola.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a PhD candidate and graduate
research assistant in the entomology and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant pathology department.
[SPEAKER_03]: at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He works in the research programs of UT
specialty crops and field crop pathology
[SPEAKER_03]: focusing on sustainable disease and
integrated pest management systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: where he's co-mentored by doctors Heather
Kelly and Zachariah Hansen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rufus has a master's of science degree in
agronomy focused on plant pathology from
[SPEAKER_03]: the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a
bachelor's of science degree in
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiology from Adekunle Adjasin
University in Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_03]: His areas of interest include management,
management of field and specialty crops
[SPEAKER_03]: with emphasis on the improved adoption of
integrated pest management and natural
[SPEAKER_03]: products and crop protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rufus was recently awarded a developing
emerging agricultural leader and talent
[SPEAKER_03]: grant by Cortiva Agriscience in
recognizing his potentials as an emerging
[SPEAKER_03]: crop protection future leader.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Rufus, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hi Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can we start off with you just telling
listeners a little bit about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my name is Rufus Sakirinola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm originally from Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, Nigeria, I studied microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2016 and 2014, I moved to the
US where I studied agronomy and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology in University of Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 2018, I moved to Tennessee where I'm
currently learning of my PhD in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're currently a graduate research
assistant at the University of Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_03]: You studied microbiology in Nigeria and
then Nebraska and now Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're fairly well traveled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for listeners to understand,
I know some people have mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past their hard of hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I may repeat some things Rufus shares
just to just for the ease of those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really wanted to share Rufus's
research because it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a paper that I'm looking at
right now that's called hemp fungicide
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy field trial for leaf spot and
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about how you're
working with hemp and why you picked leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: spot and powdery mildew for your trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Tennessee, in 2018, there have been
a lot of people interested in growing
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is so much little knowledge and
information about disease that are
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since so little research has been
conducted in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Tennessee, among the most common
disease that our growers reported to the
[SPEAKER_00]: professors on the station, especially leaf
spot powdery mildew, one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They especially affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of the leaf, including even
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Tennessee, the most common disease
of hemp is CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for clarity, between hemp and
marijuana, in Tennessee, hemp is leger,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas marijuana is leger.
[SPEAKER_01]: To differentiate that, where the THC
content, which is the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: compound in hemp, is about 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's higher than that, it is
considered to be marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hemp that we produce is hemp for
CBD, which is different for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, going back to why I issue the
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of trouble with hemp
leaf spot and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of knowledge on how to,
what can be used to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even products that are legal,
they are not legal for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp is a relatively new plant to the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we picked the research to
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there just isn't a lot of data out
there or research.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really doesn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new crop, pretty much worldwide
when it comes to the academic world.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been some research, I know,
out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some work out of Italy as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting to see research here in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: On hemp, which, as you mentioned,
is different than what the government
[SPEAKER_03]: calls marijuana, what growers call
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're absolutely right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in terms of hemp leaf spot and
powdery mildew, that's going to cause leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: necrosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're losing the leaf's ability to
photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stressing the plant, which can lead
to decreased pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, like you mentioned, just affect
the overall vigor and health of your crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would affect your yields overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, powdery mildew is one I'm more
familiar with here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had to deal with hemp leaf spot
or anything like that myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm aware of what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this trial, you guys looked at the
research shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the paper now, and I'll
attach it to the podcast page for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you set up a bunch of plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why don't you just tell me,
what did you compare in your research?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you looked at four fungicide products,
correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and list them because I'm
reading this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have Stargus from Morone
Bioinnovations, Def Guard, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: general hydroponic product, Exile from
General Hydroponics, and Regalia from
[SPEAKER_03]: Morone Bio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you find?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it looks like a couple of these are
biological fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, why did you select
those products, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said earlier, there are so little
products, if it's at all, that is labor
[SPEAKER_01]: for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently, I think about last year or
2019, the EPA approved some products,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 59 of them, for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Tennessee, only about four of those
were approved by the Tennessee Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Agriculture to be used on hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though they have been approved,
there was no data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, all the products, let's say,
they are like, they call them reduced-risk
[SPEAKER_01]: products, or only listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that means they are biological
products, which potentially are less toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: to the environment or to women compared to
men.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, these products are selected
because, one, they have just been approved
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture
for use on hemp in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, we are particularly
interested in testing reduced-risk
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which are more friendly to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason you chose them are because
you had to choose a product that was
[SPEAKER_03]: approved by the state of Tennessee for use
on hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you wanted to go with more
reduced-risk products, so things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you wanted to go with something that
was organically listed or approved by
[SPEAKER_03]: OMRI, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that you mentioned that I
think is really important is that there is
[SPEAKER_03]: no data on these products from a
university.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because a product is approved
does not mean it has good efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a really important point
for growers to think about when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing products to apply, because
there's a lot of good sales information
[SPEAKER_03]: around these products, but not a lot of
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why not an oil-based product?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I think of would be
something like SufoilX, which is a mineral
[SPEAKER_03]: oil-based product that's OMRI listed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if it's been approved in
Tennessee for that specific use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But wouldn't pretty much any oil-based
product kill a fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, with any products kill fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any oil-based?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it looks like you went with
biological, and then the regalia is a
[SPEAKER_03]: knotweed extract, and then the exile is a
potassium salts of fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a reason you didn't choose an
oil-based product?
[SPEAKER_03]: In your trial?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was there just not one available on the
market that was approved?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another criteria we use also to select a
product to be tested is we also look at
[SPEAKER_01]: some other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the products that have been
tested by other times?
[SPEAKER_00]: When scientists are interested in some
products in other states, it shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a green light that such products
may be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look online, there is no any
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at scientific data base like
Planned Disease Management Report.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at that data base,
you find information on a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: product in a nearby state or state within
the same region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have some green light weather
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, although we want
results, but ultimately also we also want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to recommend products to our
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want something that would be
effective for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the scientific
literature from other states, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that we see, okay, maybe it has
infected these ones in other states and
[SPEAKER_01]: they show some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we select those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not necessarily because the other ones
that maybe oil-based products are not
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because we don't really have any
initial information that can which we use
[SPEAKER_01]: to qualify as a criteria for testing a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, as a scientist,
I mean, you want to test everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do all this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, you have to
pick something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't test 20 products or your
statistical significance would be too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to test every product,
in fact, you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: numberless, numerous of them to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are a lot of products there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have some criteria to go
by.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other products, if you end up
testing them, that does not mean you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have good efficiencies from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, you want to
consider that you're going to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have some good efficiencies so that your
growers that you are farming, as an
[SPEAKER_00]: extension, my PR, Dr. Anthony,
he is an extension specialist for
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, you receive
calls from growers to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to give them recommendation on something
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, we want to be
able to have like positive recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: on something that can, you know,
we can actually grow this effective in
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennessee and you can use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to find something that will be
effective that you can recommend to
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and that you know works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it works in Alaska or
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It matters if it works in Tennessee,
because those are the growers that you
[SPEAKER_03]: work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you set up this experimental design and
these plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were hand watering two to three times
per week and weeding with mechanical
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you had, it looks like I'm
reading your report here, leaf spot
[SPEAKER_03]: severity around 2%.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started the fungicide applications and
repeated seven times at 10 day intervals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you did disease ratings to
measure the severity of the disease and
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount of disease symptoms and
incidents you were seeing on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just dive into the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you find with these four products
compared to your control as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: reduction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as you probably see from the results
section, the research table that's
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared, most of the product has some
level of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, okay, let me describe the
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: In total, we have a treatment and one of
the treatment is the positive control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The positive control means we know that
this is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can control these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the cordage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's not levered for hemp
in Tennessee, we use that as our check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can set up when something
works, we'll be able to control it with
[SPEAKER_01]: our treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have another treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the untreated, untreated
treatment, which is, it means it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: treated with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the disease is there,
disease continue to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not treated with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the four other treatments,
our tested products, which include the
[SPEAKER_01]: styros, the regalia, the devgad,
and the edgad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see from the result table,
that the most effective form among the
[SPEAKER_01]: four products is the regalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And regalia has a moderate, relatively
higher efficacy compared to the other two
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can see, we look at the,
to summarize the efficacy, we look at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at the disease index table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disease index means the summary of the
index and the summary of the incidence and
[SPEAKER_01]: the severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the incidence measured out of,
let's say out of the old plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the proportion of the plant has
disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, if the plant has five
branches, is it all the branch that has at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a symptom of Lisbeth or just one of
the branch, all of the branch?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is incidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the severity, we look at the leaf,
you know, on each leaf of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many parts or what proportion or
percentage of that leaf has the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we take the data, both incidence
and severity data, we multiply that and
[SPEAKER_01]: divide by 100 to determine our disease
index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is summary data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the disease index table
for regalia, you will see that our value
[SPEAKER_01]: during our TD dates, data collection
dates, you will see that it's always lower
[SPEAKER_01]: than the untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The untreated has like, for instance,
during the first date, the untreated has
[SPEAKER_01]: like a level disease index, while the
regalia has six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the final dates,
regalia has 16 and the untreated has 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that shows that it's controlling
disease compared to the untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you look at the area under
disease progress, that is also known as
[SPEAKER_01]: disease intensity across the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to summarize disease across the
date or during the period of the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also use that term also to describe
the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also look at the untreated,
which is our negative control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that the data is higher than
regalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regalia has lower disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The area under disease progress compared
to the untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The untreated has 643, regalia has only
381.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you look at the letter,
the letter after the value, regalia has
[SPEAKER_01]: letter B, whereas the untreated has letter
A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shows that the letter is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the letter is different,
it shows that the values or the efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of that treatment is different from the
untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we now go to the next effective one
is stagos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that stagos, stagos,
okay, no, x-ray, x-ray, x-ray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then followed by stagos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the lead spots, that's regalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at, if you look at DevGuard,
you can see that the number for DevGuard
[SPEAKER_01]: is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost, it's similar, not almost,
it's similar to the data on untreated
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means the plan that are treated
with DevGuard is not different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the disease was not different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, so it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to summarize what you're saying is
between the untreated and DevGuard,
[SPEAKER_03]: when it came to lead spot, there was no
statistically significant difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had potentially a 2% reduction,
but your standard deviation was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: greater than that, is my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had exile with 44% disease
reduction, stagos with 43%, and regalia
[SPEAKER_03]: showing 41%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all, that's why they have the B
after the disease intensity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fairly moderate disease reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now one question I had in my head while I
was listening to this was, did you spray
[SPEAKER_03]: the untreated crop with water as a way of
removing that as a variable in comparison
[SPEAKER_03]: to these other treatments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, could just the application of water
reduce the amount, the fungus growth on
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not spray with water because we
were, this study is a fib study.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was, if it were a ground,
fib study, where there is no rainfall,
[SPEAKER_01]: we normally spray with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fib trier, when you spray your
produce, and even though you do not spray
[SPEAKER_01]: the untreated with water, rain is always
falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the same rain, rain water can fall
on the plant and have the same effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do not spray with water and that
does not really have any effect on the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious, cause I've heard that even
water with powdery mildew, I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: what leaf spot can help suppress powdery
mildew, but obviously it also increases
[SPEAKER_03]: the humidity on the leaf surface and could
lead to greater powdery mildew growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just curious about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so you're saying with the rainfall and
everything else, you guys chose not to,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're, you wanted your control to
be most similar to what a grower would do
[SPEAKER_03]: in Tennessee, which is just, would be an
application.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other question I had with the
microbial products that you applied,
[SPEAKER_03]: did you, did you do any microbial testing
to see if the microbes were present in the
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrations that were claimed on the
labels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not test that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That alone is another story to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not, you know, planning towards
that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to test it in the field to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be clear, I'm not bringing these
things up to criticize your work in the
[SPEAKER_03]: least bit because there's all these,
there's, it's impossible to look at every,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, every variable, but it's
important when evaluating a study to look,
[SPEAKER_03]: to ask questions, you know, to think about
what the implications you can draw from
[SPEAKER_03]: the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing you could say is,
well, maybe those bottles weren't as
[SPEAKER_03]: viable because they had been sitting on a
shelf for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it may be worth going back at some
point as a, as a separate researcher and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at that, but that doesn't,
it doesn't invalidate your research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, I want to clarify that for
listeners that I'm not, I'm certainly not
[SPEAKER_03]: criticizing your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give us a very good research topic to,
to, to, to, to, to think on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be another maybe
master's project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we should talk because I work with a
gentleman, our research scientist to who I
[SPEAKER_03]: work with Dr. Ben Higgins.
[SPEAKER_03]: He and I are always coming up with new,
new research we would love to see around
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to talk, to stay in touch and
talk about this, but I'm glad to see more
[SPEAKER_03]: of this research is coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's the most important thing
is that we're starting to get a body of
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge that we can begin to learn more
about this crop, because none of the
[SPEAKER_03]: research we're seeing right now is
definitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's just to start pointing us
in a direction to say, Hey, this is worth
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's where we have to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's talk about powder and mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your results with, and this was what
made me think of the water thing is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the comparison of the leaf spot versus
powdery mildew results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause let's just start with DEF guard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're, you got no significant
reduction in disease intensity with DEF
[SPEAKER_03]: guard on leaf spot, but how about with
powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the powdery mildew, we can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you look at DEF guard and
staggers, they are like, they walk in an
[SPEAKER_01]: inverse, inverse, inverse way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The staggers control disease on leaf spot,
but powdery mildew, it was relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: ineffective, but DEF guard became
effective in controlling powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it was not, you know,
effective in controlling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting when we saw the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see DEF guard control about 52%
disease compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, the staggers only control very
low disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the staggers and DEF guard kind of
switched efficacy when it came to leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: spot and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So DEF guard, not effective against leaf
spot, 52% effective against powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Staggers, 43% effective against leaf spot,
which was one of your higher marks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet only 20% against powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very not, not really effective at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then your other two products,
Exile and Regalia, and I have to go back
[SPEAKER_03]: here because I'm not familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Regalia is a not wheat extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Exile a microbial or is that the
potassium salts of fatty acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's potassium salts, salts of fatty
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Exile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Regalia is an extract of this plant,
root nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Regalia has been very effective
generally on both disease, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Exile is more effective on the powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you basically, with Regalia,
saw no powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 99% disease reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, it was barely, you were barely
able to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get better data than that on
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I do want to point out that in
feed study, powdery mildew prayer is
[SPEAKER_01]: always compared to indoor trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now powdery mildew is always relatively,
compared to in greenhouse, it's relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: low compared to, the prayer is always very
low compared to indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons why you have that
level of highly control may be the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that disease prayer in outside is low
because as you said earlier, rainfall can
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the powdery mildew prayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there is water, it can reduce the
building of spores on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you now put an effective
product, it's easily control the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the strengths of the
Regalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that, and also, you know,
I have done several other tests in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and we are hoping to push out
another publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of this year, for ton of
greenhouse trials and we have tested some
[SPEAKER_01]: new products and I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see some results as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see that when that's
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're speculating that the spore
pressure from powdery mildew is lower
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors than indoors and the rainfall
events help wash away or don't allow the
[SPEAKER_03]: PM to get as an effective of a hold on the
leaf itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've worked both in both
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen powdery mildew prayer in both
system and I've seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how the difference, the difference that,
you know, in the greenhouse, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and, and, you know, warm
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse, they control, they control
environment, which is very conducive for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: To develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no that seasonal or occasional
rainfall that washes away the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no high temperature that,
you know, you know, very high temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: during the summer that can't, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, in the greenhouse,
I can share some of the pictures I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the picture of the
greenhouse, infested powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: the feed infested, you're going to see
very, very different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very good difference between them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so they, they physically display
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same species of powdery mildew will,
will physically display differently in a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse leaf than an outdoor leaf is
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question that you raised
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you were talking, my thought
was, I wonder if we could, if we could do
[SPEAKER_03]: target targeted heat treatments or
targeted humidity treatments, similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: what you might experience outdoors as a
way of lowering spore pressure in a,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's so many, there's so many
different ways to approach this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good, that's a very good,
in our greenhouse study, we look at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, we look at, we, we have been able to
identify the, the species that cause the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse powdery mildew,
but we did not look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though generally speaking,
we know that gonovino mycenae,
[SPEAKER_01]: gonovino mycenae is the species that cause
the powdery mildew in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have not looked at the species
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different species, species that
cause the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're saying is that you
identified the species for the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is gonovino mycenae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, gonovino mycenae is one of the
most common powdery mildew pathogens in
[SPEAKER_01]: this environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just for listeners, powdery mildew is
sort of a catchall term for numerous
[SPEAKER_03]: species that produce a white powdery
substance on a leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and they don't all cross between plant
to plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could have two different species of
plants and one could be infected and the
[SPEAKER_03]: other one could not just based on that
particular species of powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_03]: what plants it can infect.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, getting back to your research here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so you found neither, neither of the
biological products, interestingly enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: was able to provide moderate efficacy
across leaf spot and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both of the non-biologicals,
so you had an extract and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium salts of fatty acids,
showed good efficacy across leaf spot and
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find any degradation of trichomes
or anything that affected the final
[SPEAKER_03]: product with any of these applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, does any of the
treatment affect the trichome or is that
[SPEAKER_01]: what you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the quality of the final product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously as a grower, you try to avoid
spraying things as we move into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, sometimes you have to, but that can
affect the quality, whether that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes or the trichome development of
the product itself, the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find any differences based on
these treatments as to the final hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I've been thinking about one
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did test the amount, the quantity,
we did a quantitative analysis of the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the, I said earlier that most of
the hemp that we tested for CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did test if our treatment affects
the quantity of the CBD content in each
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not find any difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no any difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we are talking now, I begin to
think about the chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that may be very good because you
talked about degradation and you also
[SPEAKER_01]: raised a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be nice to look at the qualitative
in terms of chemical analysis of the
[SPEAKER_01]: products, the CBD, whether there is a
contaminant or whether there is
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that may be a very good thing to
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not looked at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One concern would be if a product
contained levels of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_03]: then that would be something that you
could be potentially risking with your
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, even though these products by nature
of being registered as a fertilizer or a
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure with pesticides, but I'm
pretty sure that that's the same case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know with fertilizers, you have to get
tested for heavy metal analysis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that would be something to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't find any statistically
significant results when you measured the
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, the cannabinoids, across all four
treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see any biomass differences?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume that the regalia plot would
have higher yields because you had a
[SPEAKER_03]: greater amount of disease reduction,
so the plants were probably healthier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the results there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't see them here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the paper itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we look at the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we saw that those more highly
effective treatments have increased in
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass, but statistically, again,
they were not different.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, obviously, visually,
you can see that the number increase is
[SPEAKER_01]: higher, greater than the number known to
untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do the statistical analysis,
there was no significant difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make sure I understand this because
I think this is an important point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying that even though the
biomass visually was greater in the
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment plots than the untreated,
when you did the statistical analysis,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you did the math on it, it was not
statistically significant yield increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge point I just want to
emphasize because that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting because if that were to play
out as more research becomes available,
[SPEAKER_03]: your next table here, table two,
shows the cost of these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're anywhere from $500 to over $1,700
per acre across a season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in theory, that's a waste of money
if we're not getting biomass increases,
[SPEAKER_03]: yield increases, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question we always talk about again is
what level of statistically different is
[SPEAKER_01]: financially or economically significant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What level of statistical is different or
is economically significant?
[SPEAKER_01]: In IPM, one objective of IPM is to reduce
disease below economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an injury threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it economic injury threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a threshold that is going to cause
an economic damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you apply a product, you may be
able to, at the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to know that if this product,
even though it controls maybe a little
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, does that little disease affect
my economy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it bring some profit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the questions that also needs
to be considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really, really good point,
Rufus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the whole point of all of this is to
figure out what the economic threshold of
[SPEAKER_03]: a disease is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because it's not statistically
significant, from a grower perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could still be economically viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could still be worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very, very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though the research may not show
significance, visually, you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in theory, if we apply stargus,
and it costs us around $500 for the
[SPEAKER_03]: season, and we get half a pound more out
of that crop or a pound or whatever would
[SPEAKER_03]: make the difference, then it's worth doing
that application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we figure in the cost of the product
and the labor associated and the equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: to make that application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excellent point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good way of explaining that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to kind of turn away from this
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked you up on Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done a lot of research over the
years here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things you focused on is a
lot of microbial products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or dealing with microbial disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to just talk really quickly
about you've looked at different bacillus
[SPEAKER_03]: strains for promoting plant growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious, your research was on corn
and wheat and soybean, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: What bacillus species do you think would
be most promising for research with hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: or cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking about some of my previous
research on with the bacillus,
[SPEAKER_01]: with my experience, although I've not
tested any, I've not tested specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to see the effect of
bacillus on the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though some of the, on hemp,
even though some of the product that we
[SPEAKER_01]: tested contain bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've not like trying to see,
look at the product because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: bacillus, we're trying to look at the mode
of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my previous research, I've looked
at the effect of bacillus on different
[SPEAKER_01]: crops including corn, soybean and wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the ones that we found to be
very effective in promoting growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did a study, I looked at the
effect in promoting growth, whether in the
[SPEAKER_01]: absence of disease or whether the disease
is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean is that I did not include
like a pathogen into the rice sphere to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just look at normal soy,
feed soy, we put the, we collate the rice
[SPEAKER_01]: sphere with the bacillus and we watch the
plant grow in the greenhouse and see
[SPEAKER_01]: whether the bacillus is gonna increase the
growth in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found, we found that bacillus,
pumilis and some pennybacillus as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were effective in increasing corn,
corn growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other ones, including savansis and
bacillus megaterium was also effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically what I've done with
bacillus on other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my greenhouse experiment with powder
mudu on ham, we tested some products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the products has a
bacillus, I think bacillus obstilis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was relatively effective
compared to other products that we tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's what I can say about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you found by applying rhizobacteria,
you got increased plant growth and yield
[SPEAKER_03]: up to 200% increased shoot weight on corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you were doing it sort of like you
said in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was no competition for these
bacillus strains like you would find in a
[SPEAKER_03]: normal soil or media.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you did find that they were able to
increase yields overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's promising research, but not
definitive at this point is what you would
[SPEAKER_03]: say in terms of adding these bacillus
species to a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, as you can see in that study,
those strains that were tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the one that increased very,
very out to, yeah, let me carry it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, plenty bacillus, bacillus offenses,
bacillus in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They increase growth in that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We inoculate this plant, the roots with
these bacillus and increase growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then know that these were very isolated
from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not like products.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not like commercialized
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the objective of the study was like,
you know, bacillus, they are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: they cannot adapt to a very harsh
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we also know that some of the
bacillus, even though they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: effective in a particular environment or
region, when you take them to another
[SPEAKER_01]: region to apply, they may be inconsistent
in their application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these strains that I worked with
in this particular study, we isolated them
[SPEAKER_01]: in that environment that we intend to use
them so that we can see where they can
[SPEAKER_01]: increase growth in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the objective was these products was
going to be developed for that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the orientation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, most of them work very
well on corn in a greenhouse in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next study, which probably they are
going to take on is to, the most effective
[SPEAKER_01]: one to like take it to the feed
environment, maybe in a micro plot area
[SPEAKER_01]: and see whether they're going to have the
same effect they have in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, you're taking the bacillus
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are not commercially available
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to take those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since they worked essentially when
they were the only bacteria applied to the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots, and they did show good results,
now you want to take that and apply it in
[SPEAKER_03]: a field scenario and see if you get
similar results there is what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would be another
objective, research objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I did my research in the
greenhouse and the further study now would
[SPEAKER_01]: be to look at the most effective ones to
take them to the feed environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: apply them to corn and see if they're
going to have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have any greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing, this is probably less
something you're familiar with is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what will happen is I find on the
commercial side, on the sales product
[SPEAKER_03]: side, someone would take a paper like this
and say, OK, just to find one,
[SPEAKER_03]: bacillus megaterium.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't worry so much about the
R181.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that particular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they would say, OK, well, bacillus
megaterium is shown to increase shoot
[SPEAKER_03]: weight by 200%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would go and buy bacillus
megaterium from China or on Alibaba or
[SPEAKER_03]: something as a powder, put it on a label,
and then they would sell that and make
[SPEAKER_03]: these claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the bio-stimulant or microbial
industry on the product side is growing
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would just suggest that people do
their research and then look a little
[SPEAKER_03]: deeper into the product itself because the
strain matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It matters a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just assume that all bacillus
subtilis is going to have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also can't assume that something in
vitro or in your plot is going to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: same effect as it would in my potting soil
or in my garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people need to be careful with data and
how they interact.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to interpret it to not draw
conclusions that may not be true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Canada's industry has a lot of
products and they're not all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that we talk about a
lot on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you make a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to emphasize on that
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at my data on the seed
fungicide hemp trier, you don't see that
[SPEAKER_01]: devgad and stagos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that they have the same species
of bacillus, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So both products have the same species of
bacillus, is what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the same species of bacillus,
but different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I missed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you can see that they have
different effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it is with microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they are the same species does not
mean they're going to have the same mode
[SPEAKER_01]: of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now if you look at the second
objective, in that my microbial as a
[SPEAKER_01]: study, you see that most of you look at
the second objective is to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of actions of the bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll find is that these
bacillus have different mode of actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they may be the same species,
and they're going to have different
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, if we use this antibiotic
against bacteria, they may be the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same species, they're still going to
have different antibiotic efficacy against
[SPEAKER_01]: other bacteria or other fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be able to produce, one may be
able to produce the daryphor, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other strain cannot produce the daryphor.
[SPEAKER_01]: One may be able to like, maybe produce
some growth, plant growth to more,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other one, the other strain cannot
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very important that, you know,
that we consider the strain when we are
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, you know, that someone,
one bacillus substance works, does not
[SPEAKER_01]: mean all bacillus substance is going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why it is very important that
a sensitive study is done on every strain
[SPEAKER_01]: of bacillus, or any plant growth promoting
agent, or plant biological control agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sensitive research must be done on that
strain before it can actually be released
[SPEAKER_01]: for commercialization.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it shows, too, just how much
research there is available to be done on
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, for me, that's the most
exciting thing about this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that I'm most
passionate about with this industry is
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can do this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if the research that,
say, you know, my good friend and
[SPEAKER_03]: colleague Ben Higgins is doing,
even though it's not backed by a
[SPEAKER_03]: university, it can be preliminary work
where we could say, hey, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: statistical trending that this,
you know, this product may have this
[SPEAKER_03]: suppression effect, or, you know,
running nutrients at this level will cause
[SPEAKER_03]: this sort of plant growth response,
to where then a university or someone like
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself, a researcher, could then repeat
the trial and get more, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: more data to make a better decision for
growers long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an exciting industry to be a part
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need the research that,
you know, people like yourself are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more research to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: More, more, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's more, more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things, a lot of
questions that need to be answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we can stay in touch and share
research and learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you so much for taking the
time today to share your research with
[SPEAKER_03]: this audience and appreciate what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate, you know,
thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always look for opportunity to
share the result of my research,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I always say that what is the use
of research?
[SPEAKER_01]: If those people will need information,
they can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always, you know, I'm always
excited to share the result of my
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thank you for having me to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I will continue to work to share
this research directly with growers so
