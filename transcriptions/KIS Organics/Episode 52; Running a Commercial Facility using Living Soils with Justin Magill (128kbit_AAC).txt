[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My podcast this week is with Justin
McGill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin is an owner and head grower for
Legit Farms, a legal cannabis company in
[SPEAKER_00]: the recreational market here in Washington
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do this podcast with Justin
because he has been growing in living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils longer than anyone else I know,
and he was instrumental in helping me in
[SPEAKER_00]: testing out various ideas around soil
mixes, soil testing, and re-amending in
[SPEAKER_00]: beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is less about the proven
science around concepts, but more some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tips and tricks he's picked up over
the years as he's learned from cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that it will encourage other
growers to experiment and try out some new
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas or offer some suggestions that may
spark other innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but Justin is just a great
guy and a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to catch up with him on about
what he's been learning since
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning into the rec market and
scaling some of the things he was doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical side from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Justin, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Tad, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've known you for, I think we were
talking about it before the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: like since what, 2011, 2010 I met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you came to my wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've become good friends over the years
and definitely talked a lot about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to tell a little bit about how
we know each other and your background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're being really modest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discovered your soil and then we just
took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it achieved great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been growing for, I think since
2003 is when I first tried hanging a light
[SPEAKER_01]: up and sticking some clones under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I eventually, I tried a lot of methods
and I eventually found myself doing just
[SPEAKER_01]: top feeding nutrients over cocoa and using
botanic airline and getting decent results
[SPEAKER_01]: like pretty okay quality and everybody was
happy with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my best friend Jaya, he was like,
I know you can do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was struggling at that point with
like some pH issues and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so long story short, my buddy started
getting involved and he's got a mycology
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just, as you know, he's pretty
darn brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the construction pedigree and
just a pure love of cannabis to really
[SPEAKER_01]: motivate us to take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he started getting involved and we
decided to get a house together in
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was right around when I met you
because Jaya, he told me that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting big yields on compost based soil
and just adding water to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a typical grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much laughed at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had built a really nice scene in
our basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Jaya had met you because he
was doing some compost or some research on
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were like, hey, I just made some
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to try it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of how it went?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was literally in my parents
driveway rolling a compost tumbler around
[SPEAKER_00]: with the first few batches of soil I was
trying out at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Jaya showed up and we kind of hit
it off and I sent them home with some soil
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't growing cannabis or
anything at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys were kind of the first
testers of, I guess what's now turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: or become KISS Soil in a lot of ways.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Jaya took that soil back to our
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd had a strain called grapefruit for
years that was pretty good, but we'd never
[SPEAKER_01]: really figured out how to grow it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, I can't remember what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we probably stuck like seven
gallons of your soil or something in a
[SPEAKER_01]: smart pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we planted grapefruit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was picturesque.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grapefruit just towered above the
whole crop and the big, beautiful buds
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was, it was the kind of thing
where we didn't really need to discuss it
[SPEAKER_01]: even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a matter of, wow, how,
how do we get all this soil in our
[SPEAKER_01]: basement?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing that we did was we
had, I can't remember if they're five or
[SPEAKER_01]: seven gallon smart pots, but we kept
pushing them closer and closer together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built one big drain table that they all
sat on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kept pushing the pots closer and
closer together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could clearly see that the roots
were growing through the smart pots into
[SPEAKER_01]: the other smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we harvest, we'd be ripping
these things apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when both Jaya and I were like,
man, we just need to put some sides on
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing and make a bed out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, my little house in
Arlington had some grow trays that were
[SPEAKER_01]: already on tables and lifted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just threw a bunch of soil in there
and gave it a little experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not deep enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put walls on our table down
below in the Seattle house and it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: productive and it was so easy to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the quality of the bud that we
were growing was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just ran with it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started, you started making these
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when we first started
talking about this and then came around
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea of reusing the soil and
keeping it in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it is a lot of labor, especially
back in those days when you're moving it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a basement and trying to,
you know, at that time be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how did the whole reusing the soil
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been ups and downs
throughout that process as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that was, that was purely Jaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was convinced that we could amend
it with the proper amendments and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: reusable again, just like you would in an
outdoor garden or a green house or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time we were both kind of like,
man, we don't know why anybody isn't doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this, which is funny now looking back on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, pretty much we just seriously
went about amending the soil and reusing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got to the point where some of the
soil we had, I think there was some soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that had gone for seven years before we
ended up replacing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil tests would get really,
really weird salt levels and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember you looking at soil
reports like, wow, how is this,
[SPEAKER_01]: how is this even working?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were still getting a good quality
and decent rates or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: decent yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, eventually we,
we got this plant parasitic nematode
[SPEAKER_01]: called the root knot nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually got that myself down the
road when, when we had the program in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more places and really stepped up and
we were reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way through the system too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would plant, we would plant a plant
in soil, in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would go into flower, into an amended
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that same soil that's in the
flower beds as we plant the next round
[SPEAKER_01]: into there, the soil displaced would go
right back into our bedroom, right back
[SPEAKER_01]: into our propagation space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that little closed loop system of just
recycling and recycling and recycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, that's what got us the root
knot nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also very likely that we've literally
bought it, you know, that we got it from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody and it wasn't around before,
but we've all got varying theories on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I kind of feel like it's something
that's around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you provide the right conditions
and promote it enough, you get to toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you have the toxic levels of
this nematode, it's almost like you should
[SPEAKER_01]: just burn down your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it is so hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that happened, that was when I
quit reusing soil in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now as a vegging plant goes into a
flower bed that is amended soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil that comes out of that bed that's
displaced by the next round coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: we discard that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to just to reduce any
likelihood of something that's collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: in the amended flower beds into making it
back to propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use the analogy of a river,
like propagation is the headwaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bedroom is like, you know,
the upper mainstream and the flower rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: are all like the estuary or whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to, at the farm, really not
bring anything from downstream back
[SPEAKER_01]: upstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, I haven't done it yet,
but I've found a lab that will test for
[SPEAKER_01]: the root knot nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the trouble with that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it until you see the signs
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you see the signs of it,
it's way too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you know, we're still amending your
soil like crazy and maybe getting a little
[SPEAKER_01]: better at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're trying to do whatever we can to
avoid promoting that root knot nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm pretty excited about having the
ability to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should be able to do that pretty
soon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll just determine how long we run
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see what levels of
the root knot nematode are acceptable or
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's just any sign of it is it's
instantly over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where we're at with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to talk a little bit more
about some of the technology you've used
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years and what works for you and
what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you brought up the root knot
nematode, let's talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received some clones from you back in
the day right after you got this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to do some trials trying
to come up with an organic cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my plants, they just look
sickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this is like after a month,
they really hadn't grown much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't until I pulled the plants
out and looked at the roots that you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do see these nodules on the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a photo of it somewhere I
could share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what were your experiences in terms of
symptoms for this particular nematode?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's at really small levels,
gosh, you will see your plant health be
[SPEAKER_01]: affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have like one plant in a bed that
just doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks sickly and you can tell that it's
that it's nothing above the canopy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's identical to the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this plant will look like it'll
have it'll have chlorosis in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look like it has a serious root
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you go ahead and grab that
plant and pull it out and pull out real
[SPEAKER_01]: easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost looks like there's a bunch
of perlite stuck in your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those nodules are a bunch of round balls
on the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is what we would call galling
in a tree, you know, when a wasp or
[SPEAKER_01]: something lays an egg and oak tree builds
a big ball around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what happens in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the roots grow around the nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, the nematode now has a
permanent home and it is inside your root
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also when we when as soon as we pull
up a plant and we see signs of the root,
[SPEAKER_01]: not nematode, that just means that entire
facility needs its soil replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have not discovered a way to
sanitize the bed or the room to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that speaks to its larva and
how small it is and how durable it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larva can last for three years dormant
and essentially it's dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what grow rooms look like
and stuff, it's pretty hard to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: that clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how have you tried to treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've tried a variety of products
to sort of maintain the levels below an
[SPEAKER_00]: economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've completely cleaned a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you just pulled out the
soil and brought in new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys scrubbed and bleached it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you done to try and control this
particular pest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've just researched products that
that treat for plant parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, surprisingly,
there's not that many, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we I guess we haven't found anything
that that that seems to be very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we've gotten the root, not
nematodes, and when we replace soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized facility, we seem to get about
four or five crops without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it doesn't doesn't seem to
matter what products we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using venerate, which is it's
just the it's like Magistine from Morone
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that targets on on plant parasitic
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also it's a biological but it also
kills beneficial insects, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we were finding was most
things that were going after these plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic nematodes are also going to kill
the rest of our beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: which with the living soil, I think is a
really bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what as soon as your beneficials
are gone, you generally have a host of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues of other of other plant pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a theory that the sterniae
feldtiae, which is it's known as Nemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: II from BASF.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a beneficial nematode that
targets thrips and fungus net larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like when you're using that,
you don't have the root, not nematode
[SPEAKER_01]: problems like actually we used to we used
to add these beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was sterniae feldtiae,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we got the root, not nematode,
and actually the root, not nematode we got
[SPEAKER_01]: when we had quit using applying beneficial
nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still some mystery to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another product we use,
I think it's called Deterra or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's yet another product that I
just have not been able to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Melikon WG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Certis, but it's a frozen fungal
product that's hard to ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently, what I've been using in
the program is from BioWorks, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Azaractin, it's a Moltex, and that focuses
on plant parasitic nematodes while being
[SPEAKER_01]: safe with most beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's kind of where we're at at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about your IPM
program and protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know when you enter your facility,
you're putting on booties that are clean
[SPEAKER_00]: to help prevent some of that transfer and
making sure that your clothes are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you especially have been very
diligent about making sure when you move
[SPEAKER_00]: from one location to another or outside of
your rec growth, legit north, that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting exposed to any other pests,
if possible, or your clothing or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what sort of things are you doing in
the facility itself to help maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: control pests and things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since we were just talking about the
nematode, and I just touched on it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit ago with the analogy of the
river and upstream and downstream,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one of the main things is just make
sure your tooling, your equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: your own bodies, your personnel aren't
going from flower rooms with amended soil
[SPEAKER_01]: back into bedroom and propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just little things like trying to
treat the ground as a place of no return,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if something falls on the ground
or something that is now dirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: try not to let things hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any place that could potentially have dust
and dirt that is untreated or unsterilized
[SPEAKER_01]: is potential for that to harbor that guy
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a real challenge because you've
got personnel and you've got a facility
[SPEAKER_01]: that like the facility that we have is
it's a renovated egg farm and it's got
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty rough concrete and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the best we can with all of our
floor coverings and stuff to make it to
[SPEAKER_01]: make surfaces that we can sterilize and
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really just comes down to try to
consistency and cleanliness and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what the goal is that we're
trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really takes everyone on the team
working together on this to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't currently believe you have
the root, not nematode in your facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're just very diligent because it's
something that you've dealt with in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a devastating past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, in theory, based off what
we've found in the past, we can amend your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil for, I mean, easily five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the cost savings of just amending
that soil and not having to replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides just the cost of the soil is
just the actual physical process of
[SPEAKER_01]: removing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we build a lot of biology in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful if we can keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about your
process sort of from, from clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into a little bit of the
technology that you guys use in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you just take me through,
I think you have sort of a unique cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: method and some of the stuff that you've
sort of figured out the little tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks that make, make legit what it is,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm very proud of the cloning
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, Jaya, when we were,
when we were still partnered up together
[SPEAKER_01]: on an operation, he, he told me,
he told me once he's like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rooting hormone, he's like,
he's like, you know, you don't really need
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's crazy talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really expensive, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just thought, well, okay,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I'm not sure how exactly it
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I, I actually asked you,
you know, what do you recommend for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for, for propagation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Oh, I like these Oasis
cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tried the Oasis cubes and I
really, really liked them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would put the Oasis cubes in a tray
and with a dome over it and then rip the
[SPEAKER_01]: vents off the dome and then just water
those trays right through the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw me do that once and you like
laughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't believe what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, so I was doing that and it was
working pretty darn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when, as soon as I started having
people work for me, they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't really understand like,
how do you water this dome?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to put the right amount
of water in it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, actually Buster that you met,
crazy Buster, he just started poking at
[SPEAKER_01]: much holes in the trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could water it every day and let
the water just go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we put those Oasis cubes in drain
trays, put the domes on them, rip the
[SPEAKER_01]: vents off the dome, water through the
dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically keep those domes at like 90
to a hundred percent humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to the point where they're almost
molding, but that's what really makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: root well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, one of the main keys
is you're taking a cutting off of a really
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we will take that cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll stick it in the Oasis cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll drench them every day with water,
run it real high humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will add nothing but water,
no rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about two weeks they'll start to
root and, um, and, uh, they will continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like one of these last, like last
month we took 260 cuttings and only four
[SPEAKER_01]: of them didn't root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as you're not in a big
rush, like if you don't need your cuttings
[SPEAKER_01]: in 10 days, then you don't really need the
rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's a more affordable program
and we've just had really good success
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing on it works out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in medical days, um, we would,
um, we would take a cutting off of a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was going into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that cutting would be,
would become our next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now getting into these, um,
just these more productive rooms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed with CO2 and everything,
that timing wasn't working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we switched to moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a whole generation of plants
going into a flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just pull out the genetics that we want
to keep and we keep those aside as moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think right now three weeks
later, three weeks into flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we take our cuttings and they're at
what we feel is an appropriate size when,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, when that crop is done and the next
round is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you talk a little bit about that
extra room that you created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something you're willing to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a little brainchild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of Jaya and I, um, so I was just talking
about the dome and that dome is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's 90% humidity and
maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, when you, when, when a plant roots
in the dome and it's, uh, and you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pot it into a week, we pot,
we go from the dome into a three and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half inch pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you caught it, it, uh,
it often will wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's as those roots are,
um, are our first learning how to uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're taking it from a dome,
which is very, very low VPD to a bedroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has a little higher VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we created a transitional space,
kind of an incubator and in between zone
[SPEAKER_01]: from a dome that's 90% humidity and maybe
80 degrees to a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 70% humidity at 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just picked a middle ground at about
80, 85% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And T5 lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's real low infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put all these freshly potted plants
into this, uh, into this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally we'd get, you know,
probably 40% would wilt for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days and then pop back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they just don't wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't affect our rooting success,
but it affects our, our, our, our
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation success from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as they are perky and
standing up in that room, we pull them
[SPEAKER_01]: right out and introduce them to the
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what size containers are using in the
bedroom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're, we're using two gallon pots
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go from the three and a half inch
tall pot to a two gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and when that plant get
approaching maturity is right when we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's not running out of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't, it's roots haven't hit,
hit the point where they think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to coil and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still really in its stride.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you think that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in terms of the amount of time as
well as height of the plant approximately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, we take that cutting,
um, three weeks into flower and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it takes it a couple of weeks to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's got about four weeks after
that to outgrow at three and a half inch
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and get into a two gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, grow into that soil full
enough that we can easily transplant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, so it would probably at that
point, it would be, it would get to about
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a foot to 18 inches tall or maybe
even two feet from the taller stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would call like a, a smaller
medium sized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there you're taking it and
transplanting it directly into the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room, which has beds on has rolling beds
and, uh, the soil that you're displacing
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil coming in, just the amount
of space it takes to plant the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's leaving the facility and not coming
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but now that I've got this lab up,
up north and Blaine, what I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is I'm going to take samples from all this
displaced soil and I'm going to test it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if the nematode is not there,
um, we could just use the soil again and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or, or, or use it for maybe an maybe
outdoor production or greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: production or something that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in theory, if it doesn't have a
nematode, there we could put it right back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a little bit, a little bit
trigger shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little about your flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know, uh, this was sort of your
opportunity to design something based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience from, uh, your medical
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I know you were also limited on
budget, so it's not your ideal room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some things that you would
want to do differently, but what were you
[SPEAKER_00]: able to kind of come up with based on
your, your limited resources and the
[SPEAKER_00]: space, what the space would allow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, once again, I got to give a bunch of
credit to Jaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, well, to my own credit,
I, I was building a wood bed, a wooden bed
[SPEAKER_01]: that has slope to it and paw and it's
wrapped in pond liner and has a drain in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those beds work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they're not space use efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're stationary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, you don't want aisles when
you're lighting up a whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, Jaya didn't experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, um, he used fluent LEDs, um,
but he built wood beds just like mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he found a track and a V caster that
he can mount on these beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the beds roll together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can roll all these beds
and have a big continuous block of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you need to go in and service
your beds, you can slide them apart and
[SPEAKER_01]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he hit some amazing numbers,
some of the best numbers we've ever seen
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that little, that little rig that
he did in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just took that idea and with one
of my partners who's a, who's a steel
[SPEAKER_01]: expert master machinist, uh, we designed a
metal rolling bed and, uh, a former
[SPEAKER_01]: employee of his made them all out of a
small shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, these beds are 19 feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about four feet wide inside
dimensions and they have four legs and
[SPEAKER_01]: those legs have thousand pound,
eight inch V casters on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really stout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and by, by a thousand pound,
I mean, they can hold a thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these beds holds about two and a
half yards of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the neighborhood of 4,000 pounds or
something, and, uh, you can push these
[SPEAKER_01]: beds and you can move them yourself on the
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hindsight now is that, you know,
you're in a room, maybe you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst situation is the floor is
slippery and you're trying to move these
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 pound rolling beds and you're
feeling like you're sliding, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the one thing that I, that we need
to modify or change on the next design is
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of a mechanical way to move the
beds along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were thinking about even like a
wheel at the end of it that you just turn
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has a little gear drive and moves
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, uh, that was a huge game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that made these rooms so, uh,
productive by having that much soil in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room and all that tight together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't quite hit the numbers that
Jaya did with the LEDs in that garage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're getting over three pounds of
light untrimmed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, since, since we grow for, for a,
a pre-roll joint, um, we don't really get,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily get trimmed numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do trim everything, but I don't know
what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I mean, that's been, that's been
the goal for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of growers trying to hit that
magical three pound a light number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also, so you're using
double ended HPS, uh, which I know is not
[SPEAKER_00]: your optimal setup, but you had a ton of
them available to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already had some of these double ended,
uh, lighting, um, at the ACDE.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's it, you can air cool just the
hood itself and not the bulb, which makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it good for a budget grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you do a lot more ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put in a whole air system to
air cool these lights, but then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: size down your AC substantially,
which is a huge, uh, money saver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that's exactly what I did up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I was buying the lighting,
you happened to find they were clearing
[SPEAKER_01]: out this ACDE ballast, um, um,
that has the ballast attached to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hood and ballast all attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got our lighting for that whole
facility for, gosh, like eight grand or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, which is almost
unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it allowed me to do about,
um, at least 33% less AC than most people
[SPEAKER_01]: do, but probably about half as much air
conditioning as most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those lights, uh, you just got to run
them really high and, uh, we, we have them
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed stationary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't move them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let the plants just grow towards them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know ideally you want to switch to LEDs,
but the cost difference just wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: something you can do at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but what are some of the things you've
learned with this new room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know this is your first time with
a sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time was with rolling tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I know you've been using blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for a while and you're quite familiar
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put a picture up on our fate on
our Instagram from one of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your beds a while back in terms of the
blue mat setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, take me through some of the fits
and starts in terms of, uh, what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from, from sort of this new
environment as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, one of the first things is like,
uh, well, how much dehumidification do you
[SPEAKER_01]: need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, our bigger room that you just
threw up there looking at it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1100 square foot room, maybe a little
under 900 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but there's 28, 29 yards of soil in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so if you do typical calculations
for dehumidification, um, it gives you a
[SPEAKER_01]: start, but I kind of had to just almost
just pick a number of dehumidifiers and
[SPEAKER_01]: try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went with quest, uh, I've had great
success with them in the past and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a really good reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was, that was one of the
challenges was sizing those guys and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, did pretty good right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I can't remember, uh, I have a
theory for pints per square foot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not at the top of my head right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but basically that big thousand square
foot room has four quest to 25 commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: units that, that, uh, dehumidify
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about airflow and air movement
around your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you ran into some of the
challenges, uh, your first cycle with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants getting too big in terms of growing
more than you expected and also getting
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant a little late as you're getting
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about,
uh, how you've sort of dialed that in over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last few cycles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so up until now been running smaller
rooms, basements, garages, bedrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, oscillating wall fans are the
standard there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but once you get into a really big
room, all those oscillating wall fans,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, they just create a bunch of turbulence
and they're not able to effectively,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, penetrate that, that core of the room,
the, the, the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I took a stab at horizontal
airflow, HAF, which is the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard of the greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's just, it's exactly like
this, like it states horizontal airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, what you're doing is you're,
you're creating a vortex and you're moving
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the air in the room in,
uh, kind of a cyclone and you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to move a big wall of air,
not necessarily very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to move it all and stir it
in a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a bunch of HAF greenhouse fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I started off with just a handful of
them kind of specked it out the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: would a greenhouse and we fired it up and
it was clearly not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kept throwing more fans at it
all in a spiral and we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the big wall of air moving in a
cyclone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's kind of an eye to the storm,
but it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, um, yeah, like you were saying,
uh, I, I, I came into these rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not, you know, not really knowing how
to run a real big room like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came into them with a lot of plants
and pretty big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I raised, I got the lights up to a
hundred percent real quick, started really
[SPEAKER_01]: dumping CO2 on them, trying to really hit
it out of the park, but ended up kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead the plants all took off and got
real leggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen the rooms, you know,
the, the, the lighting stands at about 12
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, the bed stand at about three feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our plants, you know, ripped up
there and kissed the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as soon as you got, as soon as you
have varying heights and a canopy and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to do horizontal airflow,
those are like mountain tops in your wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it stopped our airflow in
some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I got, then we got crazy heat
right where we would have a short strain
[SPEAKER_01]: next to a tall strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't be able to mix the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, uh, we, we got better at,
um, at getting appropriate sized plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and the right number of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then using the right amounts
of CO2 to not get the rapid growth when
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get the rapid growth when you do
want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has really helped that horizontal
airflow work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, during the process, I also learned
about vertical airflow, um, the Vosserman
[SPEAKER_01]: V airflow fan is probably the most
well-known from that, um, that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically a ceiling fan that
blows straight up into like a toroid type
[SPEAKER_01]: shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what it does is it,
it pushes air upwards that spirals around
[SPEAKER_01]: and then comes back up, um, which helps
get CO2 to the stomata under the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think the horror, the,
the, I'm curious to try vertical airflow
[SPEAKER_01]: to see how it compares to the horizontal
airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people really, really square by it,
but, um, if you can get your canopy at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right height, not too tall and consistent,
the horizontal airflow works pretty darn
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that leads us into the next
thing you were maybe going to ask about
[SPEAKER_01]: with the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been, I've been using atmospheric
CO2 air exchange rooms, um, ever since,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Jaya and I had the house of Seattle in
2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, it's kind of embarrassing,
but I was going into rec without,
[SPEAKER_01]: without real deal CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I just started dumping CO2 in the
rooms right off the get-go and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: just went bonkers and just stretched for
the life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what I'm doing, I following the
guidelines of, of, of some other growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and one of my partners to help me out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we ease them into the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that first three weeks, we just ease
them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want rapid growth in the first
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to root down and get all
established in the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think about the end of week
three, um, you're seeing, you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: little buds and you know, they're not
going to stretch too much at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we start giving them the real high
levels of CO2 and, um, and do that for
[SPEAKER_01]: about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that puts you around the end of week
seven or week seven ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's when we start cutting it
back for, uh, for the last two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really helps them plump up and
finish, which, um, we thought that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: myth for a while, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that no, it really works well,
but you know what the big thing was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you'll find this interesting
because it involves your soil is when you
[SPEAKER_01]: amend this soil or even brand new soil,
when you put 28 yards of it in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: and you seal it, uh, the CO2 that it
produces is substantial to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had put in an air system and air
exchange system to, to specifically deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with high nighttime CO2 levels of the way
to evacuate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just didn't really, I had never
wrapped my head around what are high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels and why do we want to avoid it?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I was having these problems with
plants, just not finishing and getting so
[SPEAKER_01]: STEMI and just really woody and big and
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, we grew some amazing buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of cool looking, you saw one
of those crops, um, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't getting the profile we were
looking for and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was talking to Jaya about it
and he told me that a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people experience, uh,
uh, what they call night growth with high
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 levels at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is, which is something that you
don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm not, I'm not exactly sure on
that science there, but as soon as I
[SPEAKER_01]: started evacuating nighttime CO2 and
getting it down, like, um, definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: under a thousand PPM or maybe even closer
to 600 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as soon as we started evacuating those
nighttime levels, um, our plants started
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing at a better, more of a proper
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as, as we lowered the
levels in the first three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: it got rid of that crazy high growth and
then cutting the CO2 back at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: allows them to finish real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with learning all of that, um,
that's made these rooms really take off
[SPEAKER_01]: now and not, and we can predict the growth
that we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so it won't affect our,
our airflow and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these lights are so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants get too close to the lights,
it's really hard on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, they're just, they're so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you throw some numbers around for CO2
in terms of ranges that you like to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, first of all, like we would go
into one of these rooms at night after the
[SPEAKER_01]: beds are freshly turned and you'll see
3,400 PPM CO2 at night in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: which some other growers would probably be
like, Oh my God, dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, that, um, that just shows you how
much CO2 comes off of these beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like little reactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, um, by, by running, basically I
run air exchange every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, I've got 15 minutes on 15
minutes off of air exchange all through
[SPEAKER_01]: every dark cycle of these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps the CO2 levels anywhere
from 500 to 900 PPM at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's really hard to get the levels low
when we first amend, um, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just producing so much CO2, but that's
also a time when a little bit of excess
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, I don't think it's so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want that CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're budding and trying to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do kick on the CO2,
what levels are you shooting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll just go back to the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so atmospheric CO2, I think it's
350 parts per million or 350 to 400
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's outside in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we'll run our bedroom at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're trying to keep it slow or keep it
kind of moderate growth, but if we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: step it up and get things growing faster,
we'll go up to six, 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I haven't gone any higher than
that in the bedroom because it just hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then when the plants go from veg
to flower, we try to match every condition
[SPEAKER_01]: we can as close as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do, we'll do a similar CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to get a similar amount of a
light value of our lights dimmed and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then we will, we'll go for
those levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for the first three weeks and,
um, right now I'm, I'm, I'm six to 700
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million of CO2 for those first
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as we see those flowers
develop in, then I will step it up in two
[SPEAKER_01]: days to 1250, 1300, something like that
for, for, for three weeks straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then step it right back down to about
650, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are some levels that my partner
with a lot more CO2 experience than me
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: To work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and we just, we just grew two of
the most beautiful crops that I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: been a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, that was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're always learning and
tweaking and figuring stuff out as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's, uh, I think that's
the, what makes a good grower is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you're constantly improving and
learning and making changes and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fun part too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the, it's like, I'm a,
I'm a, I'm a gear head also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like the tuning part,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's the part where we really
get to interact and interface with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of my passion in this too,
is I really, I really like when biology
[SPEAKER_01]: meets machine and they work together in
harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's, I love that about our
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting mix of everything from
creepy crawly insects and beautiful green
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to like, you know, huge HVAC
systems and dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ducting and industrial things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also got a real big kick out of,
uh, uh, remodeling and renovating an old
[SPEAKER_01]: egg farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was really dilapidated,
but we were totally able to polish it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we impressed even the landlord
and some of our partners that we could do
[SPEAKER_01]: what we did and what most people saw the
tear down building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it looks, it looks great in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fun to come visit when I get
the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what other question that popped up in
my head while you were talking about was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is something that you learned
about, uh, and again, give a lot of credit
[SPEAKER_00]: to Jaya here for a lot of this,
um, sort of as you were growing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of came up with the phrase swamp mode
at one point, as you were experimenting,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk a little bit about what
you've kind of like figured out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've had like legitimate scientists
come on that have PhDs in airflow and air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot of what they share is
obviously really interesting and important
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, is the basis for a lot of the
information, but what are you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you figured out just sort of,
you know, hands on the ground as a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years with your experience with
all of this and what VPD chart are you
[SPEAKER_00]: using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of the, the way that we're all
taught to grow cannabis is humidity is
[SPEAKER_01]: your enemy and you're just trying to keep
your humidity down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just rammed down your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that just drive your humidity down
humidity, high humidity causes mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get it down, get it down,
get it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm pretty good at building these
air exchange rooms with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification and we can get our
humidity really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which my little group, our little
group, we just, we didn't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity played an important role.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't realize the role that humidity
might actually play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you asked about swamp mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was, um, um, I was growing,
my partner Buster was growing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaya was also growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, this is, this is an area of
our, I feel some of our greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation because we all had our little
experimental rooms that we could run
[SPEAKER_01]: independently and share what we were
finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, Jaya, he's our brain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, he's in the venues that,
you know, about where people talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: things and read scientific documents and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jaya is learning all about VPD and what
does your vapor pressure deficit and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's charts and doesn't really know how
to apply it yet, but he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another acronym.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, meanwhile, my partner Buster,
who he, he is just the absolute character.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's one of the only people I know who
could somehow have his exhaust system off
[SPEAKER_01]: for his room, have all of the lights on
and flood the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow this guy did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the lights are on, but the
exhaust system's off and the room is
[SPEAKER_01]: flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he accidentally swamped his room.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, and what I call swampy is,
you know, it's upper seventies and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: anything over 70% humidity in the upper
seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you that swamp feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just got off the plane and the
East coast, or maybe even Hawaii and you
[SPEAKER_01]: hit that wall of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what Buster did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He accidentally, he accidentally swamped
his room and got it up in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the high seventies and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what he noticed was all of the
leads started standing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, people call it praying, but,
uh, all the leads started standing up
[SPEAKER_01]: really stout and firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, uh, that's probably a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short, Jaya was learning
about VPD online and, um, and humidifiers
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they have some applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd only heard about dehumidifiers for
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're talking about humidifiers
and then Buster is now that he's now that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's flooded this room and seeing what the
plants did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's spraying his walls down and
spraying the floor down with water to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the room to stay high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's running his hose in front of
oscillating wall fans and letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: water just spray across the room is
absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, but meanwhile, um, I'm Mr.
Powder mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give me any strain and I'll
probably get powder mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I can, uh, Buster, you know,
he's had trouble getting his plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: root really well and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pretty good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was giving him plants for his grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would often give him these plants
that by the time he got them, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in powder mildew and, um,
and then they would go to his place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a week or so, all that mildew
had turned to like grayish brown was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't, it's funny cause Buster
was working for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't tell me at the time that he's
doing his experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I would have said, dude,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but meanwhile, he's doing these
experiments and I started to notice,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you powder mildew plants and
the powder mildew is going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I walked into one of his rooms
without telling him once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He explained it and explained swamp mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to put it together that by
running really high humidity, we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of powder mildew, which was
just a blue, it was blowing our minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, Jaya is explaining what VPD
is and how a measure of VPD is a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of talk about what we're experiencing
here with the relationship of temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: to humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so now Jaya gets with humidifiers and
little, um, you know, uh, whatever we call
[SPEAKER_01]: them, a controller for the humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started experimenting with
humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over the next couple of years,
we would, we got some of our, some big
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, some big quality, but we also
pushed the limit to and rotted out almost
[SPEAKER_01]: entire crops running too high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but this began kind of the,
the journey of, of understanding VPD and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually now we've actually got
some, some, some theories that we stick
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, you had asked about a VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I have a, I have an Instagram
screenshot that Jaya sent me of a VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure whose chart it is,
but it's some, it's another living soils
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've noticed that other living soils
growers, um, are, are using VPD ranges
[SPEAKER_01]: that are right in line with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there, there isn't necessarily
like, um, a VPD range for candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of based on the opinion
of the grower, I would say, cause you see
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD charts and you're like, Oh my gosh,
I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we've got this chart that we're,
that we're looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really goes along with what we're
finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll send you that chart so you have
it, but it's, uh, it's like VPD levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in veg, I think in the upper eight to
nine, you know, somewhere around there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then flower, we start to dry it out a
little bit more and the VPD level comes up
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit, like maybe a point and a little
over a point somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that's on the wetter side
of what cannabis growers, um, somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: agree on as VPD ranges for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but let me say this, the, um,
when you, when you give them low VPD,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get some of the, some of the most,
uh, some of the fastest growth you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen, but when you get into those VPD
ranges, you're also, you're also in the
[SPEAKER_01]: territory that mold and mildew also really
likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start to find a balance of where
the plant's really healthy, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and mildew just can't really take a
hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've recently discovered,
which once again, talking about it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it seem kind of like, it should have been
obvious, but, um, your VPD is a
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship of temperature to humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say we are achieving this VPD
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to achieve this VPD number during
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if your humidity, if your
temperature is dropping in your room,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six degrees at night, your humidity
needs to drop an appropriate level to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve that same VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that I've discovered
in the last year here and started
[SPEAKER_01]: switching out all my controls to day night
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now pull the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down at night, um, in direct relationship
to temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really helped with the last little
bit of powder mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was, I thought I had
graduated, uh, powder mildew master's
[SPEAKER_01]: class here a little while back and,
um, it came back and schooled me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I, um, learned about this,
um, running lower humidity at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: which seems real obvious now, but at the
time it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and now we, once again,
our knock on wood, we are a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent powder mildew free without,
you know, we don't do any sulfur burning
[SPEAKER_01]: or vaporizing and we spray a real minimum
of sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you can just tell by looking at
the plants, you know, when you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: in the VPD range that, that you want to be
in, you just see the big glossy,
[SPEAKER_01]: dark green, beautiful waxy leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also directly related to how
dialed in your blue mat system is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can, I can go into a room and
look at the size of the leaves and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and tell you whether there's
automated watering system or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little bit about blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know with the rolling tables,
you had to be a little more creative with
[SPEAKER_00]: your solutions there because the,
the lines aren't staying still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also, um, I was just up there
and I, I didn't realize how much you like
[SPEAKER_00]: the protective caps that go over the
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for people unfamiliar with blue mats,
you know, I've done a few podcasts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Ben Higgins who I just
interviewed, uh, he's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the results from a recent trial on
blue mats versus some hand watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: the gold leaf facility that we're hoping
to put out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, what are your experiences with
them and sort of how did you design your
[SPEAKER_00]: setup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me back it up just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, um, Jaya has got a grow in Seattle
and I'm back up in Arlington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've, we've, we've already done our,
our communal project together and now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm going and visiting his scene
and checking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a total stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a cannabis lover consumer to the core.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Jaya is a little, not so much
little lighter weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just more passionate about growing
plants and permaculture and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I'm going to his house and I'm
looking in his basement and he's got some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff hanging up in there and I'm just
blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes are huge and the leaves are
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow cannabis that looks like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he's just all casual and orange
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh yeah, this train didn't yield
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's what ultimately got me to
do blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd already had a blue mat system
purchased and a lot of it was built.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hadn't put it in yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was mainly after it just to free up
my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have to hand water anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that when you, um,
especially with your soil, when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you automate the watering on that
soil, you unlock it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I, I at that point from that point
on is when I just became a huge proponent
[SPEAKER_01]: of blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, also another thing, um,
when I blew matted my first set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and this is pretty common,
uh, had it all set up and had some of it
[SPEAKER_01]: was overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the drippers were definitely
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but Jaya and I noticed those were
always the biggest plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's when Jaya taught me that
nitrogen is uptakeable when it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, basically when it's in wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're hand watering all the time
and your plants are drying out,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not able to uptake those nutrients
at that point when they're dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're literally not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, yeah, like I was saying,
we would, we would get these plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be much bigger than the rest of the
plants when they were overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we started experimenting
with, uh, with, with running the blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: system, even wetter, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, like the blue mat moisture probe
measures an M bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so zero would be, um, sitting in a cup
of water, uh, over 200 is, I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a wilting plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, 80 to 120 M bar is recommended for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but now we adjust it to where we're
down to like, 40 to 60 and sometimes even
[SPEAKER_01]: a little lower than 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's where we're getting just
the most rapid growth and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and health, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know you were doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually what I've seen for cannabis
is, is one 40 to one 60, I think range.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually liked a little drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, uh, but you gotta figure it
depends on the media too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, that's, that's a
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for like cocoa growers and
things like that, they actually wanted a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know cause that's not my,
my area of expertise either, but I didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea you were getting,
uh, that wet either in those beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so moving into the, the big rec farm
up there, um, but we were doing blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: in, uh, we were running dripper chains off
of a sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one sensor would, uh, would give us a
zone that was about, uh, two feet wide by
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe six feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 inches long or something like that,
a little zone, five drippers, and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to, and, uh, yeah, you have to build those
little dripper chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, setting up the rec farm,
Jaya told me all about the, what's it
[SPEAKER_01]: called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The era grow the drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so instead of a chain of drippers have
five dripper chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can run 12 and a half feet of era
grow off of one sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now our zone is like, God, it's almost
four feet long by two feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have 10 sensors in one of those
big giant beds, which normally we'd have
[SPEAKER_01]: like 20 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much easier to set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it looks like it waters better,
um, instead of a dripper emitting a little
[SPEAKER_01]: circular watering mark and having five of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have this big snake of drip tape
leaving a nice big wet swath right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, you mentioned the little
caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're familiar with blue mat,
there's a sensor that sensor has a dial on
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of it, and that is your primary
source of adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and those adjustments are critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found at the rec farm was,
well, we discovered this a while back,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't an issue until the rec farm
is that you come in and do a big prune,
[SPEAKER_01]: a crew comes in and does a prune.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are likely to knock one of those
little, one of those little, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors, uh, uh, adjusters at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next morning you show up and
you gotta, you gotta flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we got all the little protective
caps from blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that they made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we popped them on and they popped
on so aggressively that it, cause often
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to come in and make little minor
adjustments to your blue mat to someone
[SPEAKER_01]: that's set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'd come in to make an adjustment
and we couldn't get the cap off the
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would totally disrupt the sensor,
which is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the sensor planted in the soil
and very stationary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just took a utility knives and we,
we, we scraped off the nubs on those
[SPEAKER_01]: little caps and that did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, um, we go through, we did just
the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put all those caps on and with the
exception of some minor adjustments,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're good for two months of production
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you probably saw our beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have them plumbed out to a,
like a, a little one and a half gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have much buffer capacity for
a, for a leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've, I've got some of the best
flood stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like of anybody, including that rec
farm, I tried a new blue mat product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little quick release thing and
they blew off in the night and I had an
[SPEAKER_01]: eight millimeter line dumping water in the
facility all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the biggest flood I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I calculated like, there was like 3000
gallons or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some good videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that, uh, the, the beds roll
quite a bit side to side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mounted all the blue mat to the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you drop it down off the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run the poly for all the long
runs and then run the silicone for
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere that we have to touch it
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's really nice to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those main lines run across the
ceiling and then drop down to the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just made, I made their line
long enough that the bed could move about
[SPEAKER_01]: four feet in each direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, so you're putting that in
right after you transplant your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: crop in and you're kind of cleaning them
and, and re re-soaking the sensors or
[SPEAKER_00]: refilling them right before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be lazy and then I would just
take a sensor out of one crop and throw it
[SPEAKER_01]: right back into the room the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it just doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they lose a little bit of water inside
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really do need to, uh, clean them
out and top them back off every single
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that, they will work
perfectly every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Jaya really, he really did all
the groundwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a blue mat and figured it out and made
it super easy for me to come in and just
[SPEAKER_01]: put it into place on a real large system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing I wanted to touch
on really quick is you're trellising your
[SPEAKER_00]: beds and pruning them pretty aggressively,
um, at least to maintain your canopy at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the,
the trellis process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, a lot of growers do staking,
which is a very, I mean, no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to support your plants,
it's, it's, it's very frustrating and
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to do because of the,
just the difficulty and the scale of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so our beds have, uh, vertical,
um, I call them pickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a vertical post that's designed in
the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and those are about every,
every five feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that just helps support the
trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, on a, like a shorter strain to
a medium sized plant, we'll do two layers
[SPEAKER_01]: of trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: An initial layer to train them with and
kind of spread them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that second layer of trellis net
is going to support all of the buds from
[SPEAKER_01]: literally falling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then our taller strains,
we, uh, we have to put a third trellis net
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the, with the vertical posts
already there, it makes it real easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: slide the net down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like the big grid, the six inch grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we, we use the, uh, the cloth,
the woven stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like the monofilament
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reuse ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't cut them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the buds are all, they'll grow right
into that net and they're supported all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as you know, the beds roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you roll them and they hit
another bed kind of hard and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are all moving around, but they're all
supported in the trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can come in there with the dram and
spray them really aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have to worry about anything
falling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the dram sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to share that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the dram BP four, which is just,
it means four gallon backpack sprayer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but dram makes an incredible sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we were turned on to it by another
grower that we met through you who's,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's a very skilled and, um, he,
uh, he recommended it to Vagia and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got ourselves some drams and we're
so blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was just talking to you earlier
about it, but you get the dram and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get this at a aftermarket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, lance for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's telescoping and it has five heads on
it, um, that atomize the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, with that dram and that
telescoping lance, I mean, you could spray
[SPEAKER_01]: a fruit tree in an orchard with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can go through a room like one of
mine and I can, um, like my big room
[SPEAKER_01]: generally takes at least eight gallons to
spray it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to two backpack loads and I can do it
in about probably 45, 50 minutes or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's moving all the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dram with that, with that atomizing
lance, um, you can really effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: spray with a backpack sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we experimented around with some
other, with an atomizer, like a stationary
[SPEAKER_01]: atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anybody who's used one of those
knows blow a Doug fir tree over with one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the dram was just just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't want to use that for
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to throw that out there for
listeners just in case, uh, cause that
[SPEAKER_00]: will damage the microorganisms,
but for a lot of your other sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want a smaller droplet and
really good coverage, uh, the it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to run anything through
there that has particulates in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, those little atomizing heads,
they can only, they can only take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pretty really small particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I know we haven't even talked
about legit North really as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you want to talk a little bit
about, about you guys and, and where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, where you're going to the future
or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I was a medical grower,
um, from, from, from the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: right through to the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, I kept on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was hoping to get into rec,
like a lot of people, but also heard a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of horror stories too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, me personally, I'm a very
accomplished builder, contractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, to, to, to have a rec company and
brand, you need the whole, you need the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need everybody and all these key
roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of didn't think I was going to
get into rec and, uh, um, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: long story short, um, one of my,
my, my main guy who works for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of his best friends, uh, happens to
work for, uh, who is now one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: partners at this big machine shop,
which is across the street from my house,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is funny, unrelated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, this guy was a part of legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's one of the founders of legit,
or I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the, one of the owners of
legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the two founders are from Oak Harbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, he, uh, basically he just
put, he just put in a word with this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: and said, Hey, I know these guys that grow
some really amazing stuff and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to get into rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it just so happened that the legit
team, um, they had a farm up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Burlington.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm that you've been to that I now
have, um, they had that license,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had that site, they had it all
secured, but they weren't able to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they had to move to Raymond,
um, because just because of laws and at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very beginning of rec, it was,
it was hard getting, getting local
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities to get you off the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, they had this farm up there
and they were, um, they weren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got invited in to, to bring my whole
system and crew and set up in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the old egg farm up in Burlington
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and they made me a full owner
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so it was all very, uh,
uh, it was great the way it all,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it all played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the guys, it's a, it's a great
group of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five of us and we're all local
Northwest guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we are, uh, um, we're owner
funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we run our own grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's all of that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and these guys, uh, I, I, I,
I love joking and saying that I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: drummer of this band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the most recent person to join
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they already had, you know,
a whole brand and a whole company built
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, they did it all around a
pre-roll, um, pre-roll joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were, uh, they were really
unimpressed by the pre-rolls on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: and had the idea to make this infused
pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unlike a lot of other companies,
they decided to make it with premium
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from top of the plant to the
bottom of the plant, all the best stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: goes straight into the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what they were doing when I
met them and they were just starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: gain some traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I got the Burlington farm
built, um, the brand was really,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, was really getting off the ground and
they were ready for all the product that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to grow up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that marriage, uh, just came together
really, really well and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: taking good care of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, the rest is kind of
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a tough battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rec world, it's nothing like the
medical days or the good old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's all about your team and
it's kind of an endurance run and how deep
[SPEAKER_01]: your pockets are and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really, I'm really happy to have a
family with these guys and they do all the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that I do not know how to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another grower and there's
another farm, but it's the two farms and
[SPEAKER_01]: the wholesale team that does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one last question for you that I
forgot to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized, and it was around the idea of
amending the soil and soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you mentioned, at one point you'd
use soil for up to seven years,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, by recycling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your, what's your current,
uh, way of amending the soil right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of how, how are you,
are you digging out the beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you top dressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any sort of fertility
besides on top of the blue mats there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, we used to do just kind of just
throw nutrient packs at your soil and we
[SPEAKER_01]: had just varying rates that we felt were
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, um, and then Jaya got us
using your fungal compost and the only
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain compost as biological inoculants,
I guess, you know, to keep the diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, we did pretty well with that
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but now getting up into the rec farm
and where I can really focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get soil tests on every room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh, sorry, actually, I wanted to back
up a little bit for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing, uh, more of a top dressing,
not necessarily a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we called it a, we call it a half
turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would, we would use the same
amendments, which is your nutrient pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, perlite to different types of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd, we'd, we'd mix all that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we would only till the bed halfway
down and we were leaving what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: calling just a biology layer down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we quit doing that when we got the
root, not nematode because, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode is inside the roots, any root you
leave in the bed, you potentially leave a
[SPEAKER_01]: live nematode in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we quit doing that and we, we till the
beds all the way down, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and yeah, two types of compost
and the nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we, we've been getting the soil tests
and, uh, I send them all to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't know how to look at the
photo test and you've been recommending
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've cut our calcium inputs and,
uh, now our phosphorus too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we're just, we're, we're kind of,
uh, we're trying whatever you'll tell us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, uh, we're right now, our issue is our
pH is high, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to get that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we had some success with the,
with the sulfate of potash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the, the potassium sulfate was
something that was useful when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: had a deficient potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I found with the,
the male like three tests is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when you start hitting what they're
saying target range for potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: it means you're low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually want to be above that in
my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you, by you adding in the
potassium sulfate was just the fastest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the potassium levels back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you commented that you saw
quite a, quite a difference with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, application that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to, I just, I kind of had to guess on
an amount to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we, we really lucked out because
you said, according to that soil test that
[SPEAKER_01]: we hit the level pretty appropriate,
but yeah, we applied that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like a matter of days when
we had a major rapid growth, but that was
[SPEAKER_01]: also at the same time when I was dumping
too much CO2 at the wrong times too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that rapid growth was really neat
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just created the problem down
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you tease me about this, how I'm
always telling you, I got the best copy
[SPEAKER_01]: head going up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't hear from me and it
just didn't finish and got too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you being sort of that guinea
pig in a lot of ways throughout the years
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping me learn and have a facility
that I can work with hand in hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: making these improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you mentioned the agricultural
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure out how to lower
your pH a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's constantly a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I'm sure some people
will listen to this and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, what are these guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're sharing some of the like
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vulnerabilities and things,
but I think that's how we learn as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community is, is, you know, not everything
is a textbook and not everything is a
[SPEAKER_00]: research lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of do have to figure out some
things in the field and figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: works for you and your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I appreciate you sharing
some of that, you know, it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't have gotten to where I am
without a whole bunch of people all doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this together and all sharing every single
thing we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found, you know, Jaya and Buster and
you, I mean, you and Jaya, I feel are the
[SPEAKER_01]: innovators and I'm the person who gets
the, who gets the wonderful honor of
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it into action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I mean, and I want to say
also like right now our soil test,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the pH is really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things are locked out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were looking at the soil test,
you'd probably say, Oh, you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having a little trouble,
but then you walk into the room and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Holy moly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I can't wait to, uh, when we build
another room to get the new soil in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and to apply everything I've learned,
see what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate you being that guinea pig
and helping us figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for coming on the podcast today
to kind of just talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to not only talk to an old
friend, but also get to just share,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what it's like in the field
versus what you see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on paper or on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and frankly, social media nowadays,
everyone puts up all their best photos and
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the internet, no one has ever
dealt with root aphids and fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: and the canvas aphid and all these other
things that are just a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like almost every facility or grow
room I visit, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you learn so much when you're having
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, I'm, I'm always really
flying that flag for living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a, I was a very classic,
uh, typical grower when I, when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: heard about this compost soil and water
only soil to me was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, now I'm so passionate about it,
um, mainly because I am such a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: lover, but when you grow in these living
soils and we've got these trace minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've got the soil food web as built
up as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biomes are, you know, diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the product is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the, the flavor profile,
the terpenes, the robustness of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the overall health and vitality of
the plant is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I look forward to more and more
people, um, using living soils indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting with them because we still
have a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we get, we get huge numbers
and we get great test scores, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really attribute that to the,
to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you only need to add water,
you can use blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's the, one of the most
brilliant watering systems ever created.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's get more people involved so
they can figure out how to amend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are constantly learning that side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had just one, one last anecdote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was talking to a guy yesterday
out of Canada and, uh, he had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience growing in cocoa and wants to
be organic, but, um, it's getting really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good yields using, you know,
an A and B part, uh, two part with cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: and is, is, uh, small containers,
um, automated irrigation, uh, wants more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pharmaceutical environment for his,
for his, his growing operations or his
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about pretty large scale
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we were talking, I was like,
you know, I, I'm obviously, if anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's listened to this podcast or knows me
knows I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you as well, but it was hard for me to
try and persuade this guy that he should
[SPEAKER_00]: switch over to living soils when he's
having the success.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking at more as, um, you know,
a sterile environment and something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy to replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with living soils, yes, we are,
uh, saving a lot of labor with the
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and with the, with the,
uh, fact we're not moving as much material
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out of our facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot more environmentally and
sustainably friendly, but is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I wouldn't necessarily say it's
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a learning curve to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just expect that you're going to
switch over and get the same yields that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were growing hydro, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to go multi,
multi-level multi-tier with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really challenging with the
weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anyone successfully pull it
off on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to go vertical,
then it may not be the best option either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was fun to talk to the guy
and I hope that they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are open to experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I may try and bring them out to
your facility sometime to show them what
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it was, it was just kind of,
uh, it was kind of an interesting view
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are so many ways to grow
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to just say that these
other ways don't work, but that they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: but rather that, you know, for you and
your facility, this has been really
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know others have had success with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause it, it's not popular within the,
uh, within the agriculture community,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're, we're a huge minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and all the other methods are known
to work and known to give consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: product and consistent yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for a really typical grower,
um, I don't want to say the guy you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to is a typical grower,
but, you know, somebody who uses very
[SPEAKER_01]: typical methods, um, to start talking
about living soils, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping off a cliff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these guys are used to sterile rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a single thing flying around
in there or anything crawling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one of our rooms, you know,
we've got a whole bunch of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we've, we're encouraging this
biology where they're trying to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a different, it's,
it's getting used to a whole nother
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the beauty of it is, is when you
have, uh, when you've got all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: predators established and stuff,
you can, you can get one of these pests
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll shut down a hydroponic facility
and, uh, we can take it in stride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying obviously that we're
foolproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got some pest issues right
now, but, um, with the living soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a real big buffer because we have
all the habitat there, um, to host a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a population of, of beneficial that's
always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while, we'll just,
we'll buy some more and throw them in to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure they're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you got to get, you actually have
to get out over to the farm here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, I appreciate you taking time
to chat and hopefully soon, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make it back up to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably learn a bunch more in
the next year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come back on and correct a whole
bunch of things I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful rest of your day.
