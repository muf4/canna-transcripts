[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Kad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Abby Wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abby is a North Dakota State University
Extension Soil Health Specialist and
[SPEAKER_00]: Associate Professor and has experience
working with farmers on soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: building practices like incorporating
cover crops into rotation and
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning to no-till systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2012, she has had her hands in over
50,000 acres of soil and influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: management on over 200,000 acres of
farmland in the northern plains just with
[SPEAKER_00]: the personal relationships she's developed
with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many other farmers she
influences through her bi-weekly magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: articles and television segment along with
a discussion-based extension programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: She focuses on goal-oriented approaches so
that farmers can maximize the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: while reducing the risk associated with
incorporating new practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been featured in successful
farming magazine Q&A and bonus sections
[SPEAKER_00]: for her work with cover crops and ability
to connect with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was also Senator Hoeven's selection to
represent North Dakota for the Senate Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Republicans Women in Agriculture campaign
in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Abby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to talk to you about
soil and soil health today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start off telling people a little
bit about your background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am an Associate Professor and also
an Extension Soil Health Specialist at
[SPEAKER_01]: North Dakota State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been here eight or nine years kind
of working with farmers, working with our
[SPEAKER_01]: county extension agents, also programs
like with the NRCS or the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation districts to get some of
these soil health practices better
[SPEAKER_01]: understood and then implemented on farm
here in North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what I've been doing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a, you know, I guess I've lived all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, you know, I got my training in
Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Virginia Tech prior to coming to
here, worked in Colorado for a bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: grew up in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I've been around quite a
bit just looking at soils and always
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in soils and it was kind of
fitting that I ended up here working with
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers because it's just, it's a lot of
fun and I really, really enjoy working in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what aspect of soil or soil health do
you feel like you fit into most strongly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when we talked before, you
mentioned that you work with a team of
[SPEAKER_00]: people and everyone sort of has their
specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a soil biologist and a few other
folks that you work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your sort of niche in all of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh, you know, I try to fit in
wherever the farmers need me and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was pretty fortunate when NDSU
started this soil health program eight or
[SPEAKER_01]: nine years ago, they hired six different
positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm the lead extension for the
state here on main campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a researcher, Kaylee Gash,
who is a soil ecologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she runs the research program for
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: She specializes in all those microbes in
the soils and soil carbon and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, nutrient cycling, soil
biogeochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's really specialized in a lot
of different things, but mainly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having to do with the soil
ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some other, let's see,
one of the other specialists here that's
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Langdon, he does the salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have fairly young soils
geologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a lot of salinity and also
sodicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're managing salts that are reducing
our crop productivity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of specializes in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a fertility person and
then also a wildlife biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of neat that they saw that
perspective of soil health as far as how
[SPEAKER_01]: it influences wildlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty diverse team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had one that was, he was
working up in Minot and he has since moved
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the director of one of our research
extension centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been a good program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of fit in, you know, with keeping
my finger on the pulse of what farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: need or want to learn about or apply to
their farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try to direct the program in
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know, it's hard to say
what I truly specialize in, but I love
[SPEAKER_01]: like soil aggregates or something I've
worked a lot with in field assessment of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are we seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we choose practices that fit our
goals on farm, which may be different for
[SPEAKER_01]: every single field that the farmer works
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of float around and try to
make sure that the program stays relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: and is answering farmers' questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you step onto a new field and you
see, you know, their soil, how do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on mentally in your head in
terms of the steps of sort of evaluating
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first thing when we step
into a field, and I love doing this with
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmer, is hearing the history of the
field from them, getting their take on
[SPEAKER_01]: what they need to accomplish in that field
and maybe how soil health is going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in some cases we go into a field
and a farmer may just say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried everything else and what have I
got to lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying soil health practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes they're open to anything
because we sometimes go into their worst
[SPEAKER_01]: field that they have on the farm that
they've just, they've deep-ripped it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've chisel plowed it, they've,
you know, done all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: practices trying to get that soil into
shape for planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're thinking, well,
why not try reducing tillage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not try something like cover crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we usually have that conversation first
and, you know, find a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: their logistics of their operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can they do with the time that they
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're working with farms here that
are, gosh, you know, 1,500 acres to 40,000
[SPEAKER_01]: acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fairly large operations and do they
have the manpower to seed a cover crop or
[SPEAKER_01]: to run a strip-till machine and the
expertise to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we kind of look at the
logistics and then I kind of like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the farmer thinks of the soil first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do they think that it's healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they think it's pulverized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they think, you know, what's their take
on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we kind of talk through it before
I tell them anything about what I think of
[SPEAKER_01]: their soils, we kind of talk through what
they think of their soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm kind of sneaky in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of slip in different ideas and I
let the farmers kind of come to their own
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's kind of what's going
through my head is how am I going to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about this field, their operation,
and, you know, what they want to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: this field before we even really start
talking soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think as a farmer,
they're probably hyper fixated on
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and this is just pure
speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you find a particular
nutrient to be the limiting factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or do you find like, you know,
I don't know, something to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical, you know, makeup or aggregation
of the soil to be limiting crop health?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, the fertility is
definitely, you know, one of the primary
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns, you know, what's limiting in
that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, oftentimes, though,
when, you know, if a farmer, especially as
[SPEAKER_01]: an independent crop consultant or somebody
they're working with on their acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've probably identified that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they've looked into the NDSU research
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've kind of figured out that it's
a sulfur deficiency or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that that's causing their
crop to not perform, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that seems to be the part of soils
that farmers can really wrap their heads
[SPEAKER_01]: around or they have the resources to
address already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil health stuff is just a little
bit more fuzzy because it's a little less
[SPEAKER_01]: understood and it's so based on,
you know, the soil biological component
[SPEAKER_01]: and how that interacts with the chemistry
of the soil and the physical properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so sometimes it's harder
for farmers to pinpoint the issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: are associated with soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when we start talking about
it, I'll ask them about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how's your traffic ability at planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, can you get your tractor across
this field or what's it like when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at harvest, you know, do they have
issues if it's a wet harvest or a late
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, getting their combine across the
field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of it just comes down to,
you know, how's their equipment going
[SPEAKER_01]: across that field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can kind of back that into
relating it to soil aggregation as being
[SPEAKER_01]: the structure in that soil that holds up
your equipment or the water management
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it that says, you know,
if you're using water in the soil with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like a cover crop or a longer
season crop, how's that influencing the
[SPEAKER_01]: way the water dynamics of this field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how's your water move into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, I always try to kind
of go back to the soil health because it
[SPEAKER_01]: can be so difficult to kind of,
you know, learn and understand as to how
[SPEAKER_01]: is your performance on this field,
you know, with your crop, but also with
[SPEAKER_01]: your equipment, because we can relate some
of those things back to soil health and
[SPEAKER_01]: how's that soil holding up that equipment
or managing the water in that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that your comments really
highlight how complex of a system soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health is and also how that relates to
each farmer 's unique situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think even with similar soils,
just with different water management and
[SPEAKER_00]: different equipment or different crops,
you could have wildly different outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of yields and, you know,
I guess farmer satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it is so based on that
because, you know, there are farmers that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have some very sandy soils in North
Dakota, and some farmers are raising corn
[SPEAKER_01]: on those sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, corn is a long season crop,
and most of the times it runs out of
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see a farmer across the road
shifting to something like a pea crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the peas go in early, they come off
early before the moisture is limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just two totally different
management approaches just in the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that you select for that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so customized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why these conversations
in the field, you know, with farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of an outside perspective or just
somebody else looking at their field with
[SPEAKER_01]: them is really important to identifying
some of these approaches that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've, you've touched on
cover crops a little bit in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the things that cover
crops add to a field in regards to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fertility, biomass, some of
those sorts of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I, you know, we're,
we're in North Dakota, or I am,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not you're in some place probably
much nicer in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in North Dakota, we have a really
short growing season, our crops pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much are the main thing that's growing
during that season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have this long, long,
long winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a pretty limited amount of time
to get something to grow, to do a job for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so oftentimes with cover crops,
which, you know, are the art management
[SPEAKER_01]: tool to grow something between your cash
crop, between, you know, planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest or interseeding it into those cash
crops is pretty challenging for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do end up doing a ton of planting a
cover crop into a cash crop, harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: that cash crops, and then that cover crop
is already established and it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get a few extra weeks of growth
because of doing that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always trying to find new ways to
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have very few cover crops that
actually overwinter in our winters here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, you know, our, our basic tools
for overwintering are our cereal rye or
[SPEAKER_01]: winter rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and this also is winter camelina oil
seed that we're kind of looking into and
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as well as other places like
Maryland, they can get clovers over winter
[SPEAKER_01]: because the winter is mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes the, like the
clover seeds that come out of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say, well, they'll, they'll do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're winter hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get them here and it's like dead at the
door now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the spring, by the time spring comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we kind of, you know, we have a
limited window.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pick things that fit well with
our cash crops in rotation, which we have
[SPEAKER_01]: dozens of cash crops that we grow here in
North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to fit them into those,
you know, the planting time and harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: time of those, and to make sure we don't
transfer diseases between cover crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: cash crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of making sure that it works
for the, for the farmers with their,
[SPEAKER_01]: with their herbicide application too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it gets pretty tricky,
pretty fast, but we have some just basics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we go to of, of, you know,
cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radish has worked really well up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oats work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter wheat, spring wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just kind of go to those basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turnips, if you're grazing them with
livestock, we'll do, recommend some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flax has been really good for us too,
because a lot of farmers here have grown
[SPEAKER_01]: flax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to put it in a cover crop mix is,
it's just fine for them because they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like they can manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to choose things that are easy,
that kind of do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we figure out how to get it going
in a cash crop by interseeding it versus
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting until harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, cause we just don't have time after
harvest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, with cover crops,
it sounds like there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: options and it really depends on what the
farmer's goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I miss any of these benefits,
please, please jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops can work to help with weed
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help with water management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help with reducing erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help with increasing your organic
matter and soils on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you can't just bring in compost if
you have to 1500 acres that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: managing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not very practical in a lot of
cases, I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the other potential
benefits of cover crops in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know, for us here,
erosion is a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think keeping those fields covered,
especially after like low residue crops
[SPEAKER_01]: of, for us, soybeans are pretty low
residue crop, peas are low residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting something growing there to
protect those soils from erosion is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually number one on our list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the water management,
having something over winter like that
[SPEAKER_01]: cereal rye or winter camelina that can use
water, both in the fall and the spring can
[SPEAKER_01]: really help us here too, or, you know,
building up a residue with something like
[SPEAKER_01]: oats that can reduce evaporation from the
surface and actually retain some moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: in those soils is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the weeds control,
like you're talking about is excellent for
[SPEAKER_01]: us too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were starting to get different
resistant weeds up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having that early spring growth of
an overwintering cover crop computes these
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds and can help give farmers a little
extra time to get out there and manage the
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds on that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you mentioned, the increase
in organic matter is a big deal for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in our sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some composting that occurs
around here, but you have to be close to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, the logistics of
getting it on a lot of acres can be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that seems
like a pretty hot topic for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers that are interested in cover crops
is this, you know, this catch and release
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that cover crops take up nitrogen and
then they release them for next year's
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not seeing a lot of that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty complex, you know,
like we were talking about before,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a complex and, you know, if we
oversimplify them to think that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a cover crop, it'll take up
nutrients, which they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've measured that and they do take up
those excess nutrients in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then assume that they're going to
release them when a crop needs it the next
[SPEAKER_01]: year is a pretty big assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not seeing those nutrients
released for several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just, it's being bound up in that
organic material and it's not being
[SPEAKER_01]: released for a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the short term of, you know,
four to five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it hasn't been lost from the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I think there's some,
you know, some of those benefits are,
[SPEAKER_01]: have been oversimplified a little bit and
we just need to kind of fine tune that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but that is one that farmers are
interested in because they want to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer costs and get it down to,
you know, a more manageable return on
[SPEAKER_01]: investment for each acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you reference that, I think
immediately of clover, when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nitrogen fixing legumes and the
bacteria that fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, but what you're saying is that you're
not actually seeing that end in a form
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant can access as quickly as
you would have thought, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: losing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we touched on this in another
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of elaborate on that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, so clovers are really popular for
nitrogen fixers and we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: North Dakota, they don't fare very well
for us because we need 60 days of growth
[SPEAKER_01]: on clover as a cover crop to actually
offset the costs, the high costs for the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the times we don't get 60 days
of prolific growth to really offset it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use some other legumes in our
system, peas or fava bean or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, that's a little more cold
tolerant and does a little bit better as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you've got the nitrogen
fixers doing that and what can you expect
[SPEAKER_01]: from those?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the other ones that
capture nutrients, you know, the radish or
[SPEAKER_01]: oats or, you know, any other basically
living cover crop is going to capture some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those nutrients and hang onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we're just, you know,
when you have decomposition of that
[SPEAKER_01]: organic material and that plant,
I mean, you have to have the right
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and the right moisture for the
microbes to work on that organic material
[SPEAKER_01]: and to release it for, for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes when our crops need that,
those microbes may not be as active as we
[SPEAKER_01]: need them to be to release some of those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might go after different forms of
organic material in the soil and maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: going after those, those cover crop forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you'd even measure that,
but, but, you know, we're, we're also,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a timely thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conditions might not be right for
those microbes to be releasing that
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient to the crop when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also we've got these shrink swell
soils here, these high clay soils that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing some of the, some of those
nutrients get caught between the clay
[SPEAKER_01]: layers, which is getting even more
complex, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is soil, maybe that's the
theme of this whole thing is soils are
[SPEAKER_01]: complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're finding some of those nutrients
get actually caught between the clay
[SPEAKER_01]: layers and they don't get released for the
plants to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there's all kinds of places that
these nutrients are going or being stored
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't know kind of when
they're going to be released yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's from a nitrogen fixing cover
crop or one that just captures nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to figure it out when we,
you know, when we can, but right now we
[SPEAKER_01]: just tell farmers to put on, you know,
whatever rate of fertilizer you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: do a check strip on the side that's a full
rate of fertilizer, and then come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: side dress with nitrogen if you feel like
it's deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not, then the organic matter
is turning over, then, then you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not seeing that nitrogen leach
out either than necessarily you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, we're not seeing it leached,
but we're also not seeing it become
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so interesting kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone in their heads,
they think clover nitrogen, and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: assume it's going to be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like, like you said,
the microbes, temperature, sunlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop timing, all of these things actually
make it quite a complex process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, you know, it's not just this
catch and release, or I'm going to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: clover in my corn so that, you know,
it fixes nitrogen for my corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, some of it's just that
these, these nitrogen fixers are really
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial because they're dead material
is so highly desirable by microbes that it
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulates the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some leaky, leakiness
happening there with the nitrogen coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the roots and whatever else,
but a lot of it's just that material,
[SPEAKER_01]: that dead material of a legume is just
really desirable for microbes to
[SPEAKER_01]: decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, I think that, you know,
there's been some oversimplification of
[SPEAKER_01]: these systems that I think, you know,
makes it challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that, you know, not every
farmer needs to be like a super soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiologist, you know, or into soil
biogeochemistry to manage these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there are just some things you
need to be aware of to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're, you know, getting the most out
of our crop in each field and not relying
[SPEAKER_01]: too much on some of these practices or
ideas that, that, you know, we can catch
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then release it using a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, that, that is one other
benefit of cover crops that you touched on
[SPEAKER_00]: there that we didn't, I didn't mention
before, and that's sort of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: health in soils and how, you know,
bare soils just don't fare well compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to soils that have plants in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that having, you know,
roots available, these microbes obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: increases your microbial health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had talked about how,
you know, microbes get oversimplified too,
[SPEAKER_00]: to things like fungal to bacterial ratios
as a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, your research there
found that that wasn't as useful,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you, can you touch on that a little
bit too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, yeah, microbial health is extremely
important and we try to focus on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to measure it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to measure everything and know if
it's working or not, or what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, with microbes,
it's just tough to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like you brought up that fungal to
bacterial ratio, there's, there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of emphasis put on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I know how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's all these phospholipid fatty
acid analyses or PLFA and you send the
[SPEAKER_01]: sample off to a lab, you pay whatever and
get the sample back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tells you, you've got this type of
bacteria and this type of actinomyces,
[SPEAKER_01]: just generalizations of like gram positive
bacteria or gram negative bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, this is how much fungal
hyphae you have in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they create this ratio of fun,
you know, fungated bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're only sending off one sample
from one point in time, it's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you about that point, that location
where you pulled the sample at that
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, you know, it's, it's not telling
you about the whole system or what that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like across the field or the
variability that may exist or any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've run, you know, thousands of
samples and it's like, the variability is
[SPEAKER_01]: just huge with that analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't mean that it's not
worthwhile, but it also means that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sending off one sample and you're
going to make, you know, huge management
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions based on this analysis of one
sample from one point in time on your
[SPEAKER_01]: field, that's pretty risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something that we want that
we're prepared for farmers to be doing or
[SPEAKER_01]: to be interpreting really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes I look at that data and
I'm like, I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, I mean, I think it's just,
you know, using the general practices of
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing tillage you know, to create a
home for these microbes and these diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to exist, giving them a food
source, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, with your cash crop and your diverse
rotation, and then adding in some cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crops to fill in the gaps and have
something growing, you know, food and
[SPEAKER_01]: shelter is number one for these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just kind of creating that habitat
for them is probably the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just make the assumption that
they're there and that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: diversifying and that new, new microbes
are coming in that maybe weren't as
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all kind of interacting as
this community under the soil surface and
[SPEAKER_01]: then hopefully doing the job that you need
them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing is that that test
doesn't necessarily give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: actionable data because because you're
going to be trying to do things to in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of like best practices for microbial
health and soil health anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversification that you see,
I mean, the standard deviation that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen on these tests can be so wide that I
look at them and kind of scratch my head
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, you know, how can I, how can I
really use this or does this allow me to
[SPEAKER_00]: make any changes in my garden or in my
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't see it as a tool at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't make any, you know,
management decisions on these biological
[SPEAKER_01]: tests, you know, at this point,
because they're so variable and they
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on when you pull the sample and
where you pull the sample and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: samples you pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think it's neat stuff to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think a lot of this,
you can just make these assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people get freaked out about
assumptions because you're not collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual data or, you know, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have collected the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've run all these soil health analyses
on, you know, one field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 180 points across that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sampled it multiple times and
looked at these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, you know, you learn as much
about your field and the health of your
[SPEAKER_01]: field by using a shovel as you ever could
by running all these analyses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes it's neat to know and you
can use it as a baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly wouldn't make management
decisions based on that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to fumble the bacterial ratio or,
you know, any of those things at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get there maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but in the meantime,
it's just good to know that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a good home for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're covering your field and reducing
erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be getting better trafficability,
you know, whether it's a garden or a
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these changes that are
occurring as you build up your soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's just good to be happy with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, for me with the
microbes, I kind of feel like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, let's just let's just take on best
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not convinced we'll ever fully
understand it because it's such a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure that we necessarily need
to ever, you know, completely understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that is it's an interesting
thing to continue to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, one of the things is like
if you have a fertilizer application,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it rained recently, if it hasn't
rained, all of these things are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect your microbial populations pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where I think it would be really hard
to make, like you said, a long term
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so you're just kind of looking at
what management practices you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they achieving some goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe microbes are just kind of coming
along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting those benefits as you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so jumping around a little bit here,
I kind of want to move back to cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: because we talked a little bit about the
benefits of them, but we didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you talk to a farmer,
it sounds like the first thing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at is their goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, can you give an example of like a
situation with a particular cover crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of a farmer's goals and how you
would how you meet that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll do we've got some crazy high
clay soils here, but they're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: specific to our regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll talk about some sandy soils
where, you know, I came in a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: after the fact on this one, the farmer is
already doing these great things because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got a crop consultant that's very
interested in soil health and very good at
[SPEAKER_01]: making recommendations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there's, you know, there's a farmer
over by James Town, North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's got some very sandy soils that he
works with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like the tail of two
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has one field that he's been
managing with no till for 15 to 18 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably added in cover crops to that
system, changed his rotation on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow shorter season crops to be better
suited for those sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, corn and soybean would be,
you know, kind of king here in North
[SPEAKER_01]: Dakota in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just that would be the
rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he grows wheat on that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes off a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows peas on that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it comes gets in early,
comes off early and gives them a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant a cover crop in that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he started doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he followed with like an oat cover crop
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll winter kill and he doesn't have
to worry about using too much moisture in
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throws in a little radish, some flax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, you know, some of the volunteer
from the cash crop come back and he gets
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much another growing season out of
that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what he's doing with that is that
he's increasing his organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not only covering, he's increasing
organic matter so that it holds more
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture on that in those sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he's also getting better cover on
that field going into the winter to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's been doing this stuff for a
while and, you know, happy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: performance on his field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he took over a new half section of
land, kind of kitty corner to that field,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that field had been corn and soybean
and it had been chisel plowed and ripped
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started farming that first thing he
put on it was a short season crop like
[SPEAKER_01]: peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed it again with a cover crop to get
that organic matter built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first year we grabbed some soils
from from his existing field where he'd
[SPEAKER_01]: been using these practices for 15 or more
years and grabbed some soils from that new
[SPEAKER_01]: field he took over and just put them side
by side to look at soil color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the practices he'd been using with the
reduction of tillage, the incorporation of
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops, the changing of his crop
rotation, his soils that he'd been
[SPEAKER_01]: managing for a long period of time were
much darker than those in the other field
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd just taken over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that tells you there's more organic
matter and he's probably getting better
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture retention on those fields,
especially in a drought like we are in
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably got the moisture there that
he needs to get that crop going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hadn't ever looked at those two soils
side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of for him, it was like,
okay, well, now I know that what I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is working and I can just kind of
see it visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's doing the same practices on that
other field to get it back in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be one example of where some
of those changes have really made a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a field and kind of evaluating it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's pretty common when
farmers change the system and suit it to
[SPEAKER_01]: those soils, I think it can make a big
difference in how those soils perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what do you see when farmers first
start making changes like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you had a farmer who was farming
fairly conventionally, a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance, a lot of chemical
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that look switching over in terms
of cost and also yields as they make a
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm making the assumption that you
have a farmer, they really worked the
[SPEAKER_00]: land, the soil is fairly depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing their yields go down and
down and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they finally reach out to you and
say, Abby, help me fix this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, you know, it looks again,
different for every farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, you know, most of them
have the equipment to no till,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, their seeders and their planters
can all can all perform well and residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you before you go any further,
can you explain what that means on an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that a lot of people that
listen to this podcast don't know what no
[SPEAKER_00]: till and minimal till really means
agriculturally, because it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think terminology, I guess, in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no till for us is, you know,
just not making a tillage pass with a
[SPEAKER_01]: chisel plow or, you know, anything like
that in the fall or the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally, when you harvest that
crop and leave that residue behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: combine, that's what you're going to plant
into the next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to disturb it at all with
any kind of tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also kind of these, you know,
ideas of using vertical tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is another management tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as disturbing of the soil as
like a chisel plow would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, goes several inches into
the soil, but a vertical tillage would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, goes maybe two inches in the
soil, and it just places and sizes
[SPEAKER_01]: residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so farmers will use that practice
generally, you know, in the spring before
[SPEAKER_01]: planting, if they feel like, like they
left that field, we're going to try to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to no till, but the residue just,
you know, they're going to get not get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good stand with their equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll run this tillage tool prior,
called vertical tillage, and they'll kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of size up that residue and create
something they can plant into a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's strip till, which some
farmers use here, which is a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different expensive piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it creates strips in that field where
you're going to plant your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so generally, you do that the fall
before and you get your fertilizer down in
[SPEAKER_01]: those strips and you're only disturbing a
third of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the tillage happening where
you're planting your crop, and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: between you're leaving residue,
similar to like a no till situation where
[SPEAKER_01]: you have good residue cover between,
but you've got these berms or these strips
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to plant into that would
be like chisel plow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really kind of a hybrid type
tillage practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, kind of what farmers
would be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of other variations on
this, but those are kind of the general,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, no till, reduced tillage,
which would be kind of vertical till,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then strip till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to reduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When are instances where you may encourage
tilling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, there's, you know,
in a wet harvest or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, farmers may cause some ruts in
their field, whether they're no till or
[SPEAKER_01]: full tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just, you have to get the
crop off and it's wet and the equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: gets stuck or you leave some tracks or
something in the field and you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to work the whole field or do the whole,
you know, till the whole field to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't want to keep driving over
those ruts for the next 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you need to go in and level them
off with something and kind of get that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil back to where, you know, you can
harvest, you know, with your header close
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ground and not catch dirt or ruts
or, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I mean, yeah, farmers don't want
to be bounced around in their equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I recommend tillage,
you know, mostly is if you've,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have some ruts in the field from a
wet harvest or wet planting or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, and you need to get them out,
then that's an appropriate time to do
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always ask farmers if,
you know, if the tillage you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the reason for that tillage?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they can identify a specific
reason to do that tillage and can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a specific timing for it,
I think it's important to ask yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: that every time to make sure it doesn't
become a habit and something that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing because you've been doing it a
while or, you know, is the field too wet
[SPEAKER_01]: to plant in the spring and you need to do
a vertical tillage pass, then do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the field is dry the next spring
and you're out there doing a vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage pass and you've lost that original
reason for why you're doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe you don't need to be doing it
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think it's always good for
farmers to kind of check back in with why
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing something on their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if they can't identify the
reason, the reason anymore, then maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't need to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could see where you do just get
into a habit of treating your soil the
[SPEAKER_00]: same every year or your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, like, if you have residue
that's just not breaking down fast enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes aren't, you know,
breaking down whatever cover crop you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: run through the winter come planting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do in scenarios like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be, gosh,
I suppose that would be something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could run a vertical tillage pass over or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you've got a lot going on
out there and a lot to plant into,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you may decide to do a vertical
tillage pass and kind of knock it back and
[SPEAKER_01]: size it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, before even doing that,
I encourage farmers to get their planter
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and do a couple of strips into
it and just see what it's like to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, sometimes when you look
at a field, you think it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: mess, but then you get out in it and your
equipment does really well or you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: even seeding anything, but you're just
running your equipment through to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: it performs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's OK, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and maybe you don't need to
incur that cost of doing some kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, additional pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always kind of encouraging farmers
to try something first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it if it doesn't work, then come
back in with that, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage pass or adjustment or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But give it a shot first and see how it
goes and then kind of adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so all that residue is, you know,
little little fertilizer bags and little
[SPEAKER_00]: water retention holders for you,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the risk of disease,
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, potentially having more fungal
issues or things as or bacteria as those
[SPEAKER_00]: residues are breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a concern, I guess,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're changing the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the diseases and pests that you may
have had or weeds, you know, with full
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage are not going to be the same as in
a reduced till or no till situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, gosh, you can look at things
like gosses, wittles and corn that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, transferred on residue,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'm not wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep trying to remember all these
different disciplines I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm wrong, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have that bacteria on that
residue living there and you go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop the next year and it transfers over,
that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can have diseases transfer between
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, radish is also a host for club
root, which is a huge problem in canola
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you have to be careful of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you change your system, you're changing
your management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure, like weeds, you know,
in a full tillage system, they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: an annual weed issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to no till and it's a
perennial weed issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're spraying at different times
and, you know, trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage those weeds in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely something to keep in
mind that if you change one part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: system, you're probably going to change a
lot of parts of that system and just be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for it and keep your eyes open to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk with other people who have made
that transition because they know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: expect or at least to give you something
to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think a lot of the failures
that we see in people going to like no
[SPEAKER_01]: till, for example, is that they just stop
tilling, but they forget to use the water
[SPEAKER_01]: after a wheat crop with a cover crop,
or they forget to do different herbicide
[SPEAKER_01]: passes or, you know, change their
rotation, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we see those things fail
because they're taking one practice and
[SPEAKER_01]: not treating it as a system and then
adjusting, you know, the entire system for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as simple as just not tilling
your field and then treating everything
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we would call that direct
seeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, you know, you're just doing
everything the same and you just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant into it and it's not a system at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I think, yeah, anyone making
changes or doing something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to treat it as a system and
figure out what they can do to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: system work, especially for different soil
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it sounds really complex and you
hate to make it complex before somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: even tries it, but it's certainly,
you hate to see failures also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone, and I got you off topic,
this is my fault when we started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about tilling, as someone makes this
transition to sort of this soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you know, we talked about
switching from a very conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural model to something that's
looking at soil health and reduced tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know every situation is going to be
different, but what do you see in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that first year sort of a little bit of
a transition and then over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: as that soil improves, do yields typically
go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you often hear with, you know,
if I'm going to go to no till,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a yield hit for X number
of years, you know, and that's just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the general idea of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I prepare for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always remind farmers to look back
at what's their return, their ROI,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what's their return per acre?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they doing, you know, swabbing a
tillage path or herbicide path or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what are they doing that's going
to change those costs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the way down to labor and
maintenance of your equipment or hours on
[SPEAKER_01]: your tractor or what it costs you to have
a specific person out in the field doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to kind of look at all those
different things and then decide if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: success or not, because oftentimes,
you know, the farmers I work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, I mean, they would love to
have a 200 bushel corn yield on their
[SPEAKER_01]: field, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that would be kind of average and
they'd be perfectly happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some years they do get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they get 220 bushels,
you know, but sometimes their yield goal
[SPEAKER_01]: or what they want to achieve is 190.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can consistently get that
based on their inputs and the way they
[SPEAKER_01]: manage that field for corn, then they're
happy because they're having reductions in
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of feeling that out to see
how much they can cut back on fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: additions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be a huge cost saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they're only getting,
maybe they're only getting 190 bushel corn
[SPEAKER_01]: and the neighbors getting 210.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're applying less fertilizer,
they have less passes, they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: different management approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might just be that they're coming
out ahead, you know, cash wise on that
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of covered how complex,
not just soil health, but also just
[SPEAKER_00]: farming in general, and a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some resources out there for
farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the resources that you guys offer for
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, you know, ndsu soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you search that anywhere, you'll find
our webpage, which is ndsu.edu slash soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the things that I focus on
for providing to farmers are mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: videos, because they can, they can check
those videos out while they're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tractor in the combine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then generally, they're less than
three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can watch it in one pass on a
quarter of land takes you about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, less than three minutes to get
across the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can watch videos, we also have a
podcast called soil sense and also soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sense field check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to, you know, kind of
highlight the things that farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the research that's being done,
you know, kind of different places that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find soil health and those
collaborations that make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we've got some episodes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did like this field check
podcast that was a 10 minute episode with
[SPEAKER_01]: a question and answer type format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get a lot of information in a
very short period of time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd love to host meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a ton of meetings coming up
in workshops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with everything, you know,
being virtual last year, and now going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to face to face this year,
everybody wants a hybrid event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing some virtual and some,
you know, with face to face components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, yeah, the complexity to have our
programming has gone way up, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a good way, because it's just
allows a lot better access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, all that stuff can be found on
that NDSC soil health webpage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just probably get lost in
there in a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a ton of information on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had, can anyone join these
sorts of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be a farmer in North
Dakota to utilize, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: more some of these resources that are more
interactive, like the events, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we love having people from all
over join them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of it is going to be kind
of geared towards the farmers because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's our general audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but there's so much that you can pick
up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not everything would make sense
in terms of, you know, you're just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to agriculture or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but you can pick things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I started my job here at NDSU
nine years ago, I didn't know a combine
[SPEAKER_01]: from a tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never really set foot on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always kind of keeping that in
mind that there's a lot of people like me
[SPEAKER_01]: that want to learn about agriculture,
and maybe don't have the chance to but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're listening to episodes on farmers
and their stories and how they're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with neighbors to achieve these practices,
or you're learning from some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers or the extension people,
you know, we're pretty good at trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: share these messages in different ways for
different audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would encourage anyone to hop
onto these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually try to keep them fun and
entertaining because there also has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of element to it can't just be
all a bunch of eggheads, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about foil nerd talk and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to keep them fun and
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, if most of them are
free, so if you get onto the event,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like, not what I thought it
would be, you can always just get off and
[SPEAKER_01]: it costs you nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's kind of the other good thing
about it, too, is a lot of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking at some of the topics
here on your on your soil health page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have one on, you know,
a quick video on incorporating cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, building soil health, grazing cover
crops, there's a lot of really great
[SPEAKER_00]: topics on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly suggest folks check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what
extension services offer for people in
[SPEAKER_00]: various states and sort of what what that
really is for for folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I sure can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had no idea what extension was
until I got my job here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, extension is usually it's
the branch of the land grant institutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So NDSU is land grant institution here,
like Ohio State would be for Ohio,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado State University for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so there's a branch of the
university that gets information out to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, but also to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our job is to not necessarily do the
research, but to use our colleagues who
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing the research to get that
information repackaged and into a format
[SPEAKER_01]: where it can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so any of those land grant
institutions have this extension branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes, you know, extension is,
you know, there's certainly a main campus
[SPEAKER_01]: presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's faculty that do this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in North Dakota, we have county
agents that are in every single county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they they go out, they interact
with farmers with gardeners with kids and
[SPEAKER_01]: for age and just general the general
public and, and they're providing
[SPEAKER_01]: information all the time, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you if you live in a state where you
have, you know, county extension,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can sure give them a call and,
you know, find out what they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could even be that you have a
disease on your trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to know what it is or a pest
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can send a sample into your
extension office and they can tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is and how to manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, it's a really diverse
organization, because it it also you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's stuff in agriculture, but then
there's all kinds of stuff in in community
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building leadership skills at the
community level or, you know, food
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation even for canning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep yourself safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: skin cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's there's all kinds of
resources available for extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I really value this part of the
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great way for them to
interact better with the community and
[SPEAKER_01]: with with other people and and to just get
get the information out from this is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of ivory tower campuses, we got to get
this information out somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what extension does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of that bridging the gap
between infield farming and then academic
[SPEAKER_00]: research, I guess, is what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, we're kind of the you know,
if you look at the campus and the faculty
[SPEAKER_01]: on campus to work, we're kind of the extra
extroverts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the introverts that are
the researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we're the ones that like to be out
chatting and whatever about stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to know people and sharing some of
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's definitely that's
definitely how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's, you know, different
faculty for different different jobs here
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since this podcast is generally
speaking to people who are growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis or hemp, what sort of
resources or relationships might someone
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to form with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of the county extension
in that regard, because I realize like in
[SPEAKER_00]: your case, you guys don't have a lot of
hemp growers in in North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think you had said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where do you think you might still be
able to plug in and help someone if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were if they reached out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh, you know, yeah, we don't have a
ton of hemp production up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the other thing with
extension with the university is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're great for connecting people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, for example,
if I don't know anything about hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, and I have a farmer that wants to
grow it, I know at least a consultant and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also a researcher on campus that that
works with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I also know somebody that was an
agronomist that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking on CBD, you know, hemp for CBD
production, which I know very little
[SPEAKER_01]: about, but I know those people and I know
how to reach them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so oftentimes, you know,
if the extension person doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer on a specific thing, they can
certainly find someone who does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what they what we
specialize in is our our contact list and
[SPEAKER_01]: our cell phones and who we can call to
help you get the answers you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add that, you know,
soils really well, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety of crops in different soils that
might, you know, respond similar to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think you could also
probably make a cover crop recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: to at least get someone started in the
right direction or at least what to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cover crop based on your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot there that you
may be able to offer someone to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: get them pointed in the right direction as
research grows on, you know, this
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively new crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, I love learning
about new crops, too, and kind of problem
[SPEAKER_01]: solving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's certainly an area where we can
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I was just at a vineyard the
other day and they want to do cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: between the vines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I don't know, I think
about vineyards other than I like to drink
[SPEAKER_01]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, how am I going to
make a recommendation?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can sure listen to the issues and
when they need something to flower or not
[SPEAKER_01]: flower or attract pollinators or,
you know, I mean, and then we can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with some solutions together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would think, you know, it's the same
deal with hemp and what can we how can we
[SPEAKER_01]: help manage even the residue on hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I understand it's pretty tough,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, how are you managing
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what's your rotation look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's all kinds of ways
that we can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, when you want to learn
about something or you're curious,
[SPEAKER_01]: you seem to find the answer somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think your vineyard comment
was really interesting, because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: when I visited some vineyards and got to
speak to the the people in charge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and the fertility there, I learned a
lot from them on how they manage grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so different than other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also coming with an outside
perspective, I had all these things I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wanted to try or at least look into as
someone who didn't come, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally trained in in viticulture,
which, you know, I think it allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a synergy of ideas and and things
like that, too, as we talk about different
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems and different crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure you brought a lot to the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think I did in this
case, but it definitely got my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like, oh, gee, I'd love to I'd
love to try this or experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, really dive in further and
learn and see if there were things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could, you know, that we were trying in
other crops that might make sense with
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop or, you know, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun chatting with you and I
hope folks do check out some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm looking at your soil sense
page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have soil health on the
farm, how to dial in fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: precision of soil, health stuff on dealing
with salts, building soil and cool and wet
[SPEAKER_00]: climates, like just so many great topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly suggest people take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you for for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I look forward to chatting in the
future and have a wonderful rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
