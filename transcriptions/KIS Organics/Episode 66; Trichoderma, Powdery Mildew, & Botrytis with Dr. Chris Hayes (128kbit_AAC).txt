[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is with plant
pathologist Chris Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris began his journey into biologicals
while working on his PhD, then continued
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field while a scientist at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, he worked on the strains of
trichoderma T22 and G41 that would
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately become the active ingredients
in Root Shield Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left Cornell approximately 25 years ago
to help start BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past quarter century, he has
worked at various areas within BioWorks
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ultimate goal of helping those
interested in using biologicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the do's and don'ts to maximize
the effectiveness of biologicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to help prevent plant sickness
and loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Chris, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chris, can we start off talking a
little bit about your background and let
[SPEAKER_00]: people know kind of who you are and go
from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dr. Chris Hayes and I hail from
the farmlands of central Illinois and
[SPEAKER_01]: always had an interest growing up looking
at alternatives to using synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries to try to grow healthy plants
and I pursued that idea in both
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduate and graduate school and when
I was graduating with my PhD from West
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia University last century,
I was looking into pursuing the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives to synthetics to protect
plants and so I accepted a postdoc at the
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State Agricultural Experiment
Station, which is governed by Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to work at Cornell University in
upstate New York and their field areas
[SPEAKER_01]: working with different microbes,
mostly fungi that attack hosts to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: they had applicability to commercial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, back last century in the
late 80s to mid 90s, I worked at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: in the area of biological control and we
developed some pretty interesting microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that a decision was made back in the mid
90s to leave Cornell and help start a
[SPEAKER_01]: company that we now call today BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got about 25 plus years of experience
actually out there promoting and placing
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals into commercial horticulture,
agriculture, and now the medicinal plant
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm very familiar with your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, a lot of the growers that we
work with are using a lot of your
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys do a great job and I want
to circle back to some of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be best for cannabis here in a
little bit, but before we do, I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to talk a little bit about
trichoderma and mycorrhizal fungus and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that one of the things that you and I
talked about off air last week was just
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices and some of the
differentiation between different strains
[SPEAKER_00]: of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you just kind of talk about what
is trichoderma and what are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices from an agricultural
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma is a genus of filamentous
fungi found in the soil that have evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: for a purpose of suppressing or possibly
protecting plants against pathogens and
[SPEAKER_01]: all dwell more upon that in just a few
minutes, but these are filamentous fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: that are found in just about all soil
types from around the world and their role
[SPEAKER_01]: is to do one of various functions within
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them may just grow throughout the
soil taking up space, others may grow
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the soil producing metabolites
that may be both beneficial or harmful to
[SPEAKER_01]: both the plants and other microbes in the
soil, so they're very diverse these
[SPEAKER_01]: trichodermas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name trichoderma is very familiar in
the growing of plants because there's been
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of publications for a number of
decades on trichodermas and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated from suppressive soil,
soils that seem to have suppression of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists have went out and dug up
different strains of trichoderma,
[SPEAKER_01]: different species and have been able to
identify some that have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: help plants, not hurt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing from you is that when
we're talking about trichoderma it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous species of fungi and so we
actually have to be very specific when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at a particular product or
talking about a particular trichoderma and
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one product you guys carry is
called Root Shield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about how that
product came about and what that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strain is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it strain or species with fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought of it as a species but
I want to make sure I'm using the right
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma strains are like different
family members.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are really strong and good and some
can be a little bit knotty, so it depends
[SPEAKER_01]: upon the strain of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: How strong or how weak or what they can do
of any value or have no value at all
[SPEAKER_01]: because the group, the genus trichoderma,
they're known for their abilities to be
[SPEAKER_01]: found in soils around the world and
they're workhorses out in the soil but
[SPEAKER_01]: again sometimes they do good things and
sometimes not so good so they are very
[SPEAKER_01]: strain dependent and we took that concept
to heart at Cornell University when we
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained a grant we were looking at can
you produce a hybrid strain of a
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma that may be able to be used as
a biocontrol agent in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this grant at Cornell in the lab
at Dr. Perry Harmon, hybridization studies
[SPEAKER_01]: were conducted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are asexual fungi so protoplast
fusion was used to mimic what happens out
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature to produce genetic variability
and so strains were selected from various
[SPEAKER_01]: areas in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: where disease suppressive soils have been
identified and what I mean by that is
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers report record yields, high yields
in their soils but their neighbor across
[SPEAKER_01]: the street using the same inputs,
the same genetics inputs having the same
[SPEAKER_01]: basic soil profile did not have the same
success and scientists will go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: collect samples from these different soil
types and try to identify something that
[SPEAKER_01]: may be unique in these suppressive soils
and that was done and a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains were identified from
suppressive soils, hybrids were made using
[SPEAKER_01]: a process called protoplast fusion and
then time was spent to look at these
[SPEAKER_01]: different hybrid strains to see if a
superior hybrid could be identified that
[SPEAKER_01]: may have commercial attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where Root Shield came from the
T22 strain that you manufactured?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the actual number T22 of the strain,
its strain number is called 1219-22.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain 12 in red line was fused to strain
95 and many many different hybrids were
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated dozens and dozens and dozens over
100 and it was the 22nd hybrid cell
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated under the microscope when we took
it for further testing had the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes to attack the greatest range of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would grow on the entire root system,
it would grow in soil pHs, soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, soil moisture that were
highly variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this strain had attributes that made it
pretty strong out there in the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: against the range of issues in a variety
of environments and because the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: were chosen from suppressive soils where
synthetics were used, this strain had a
[SPEAKER_01]: high degree of compatibility with many
chemical fungicides that develop
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance and so this was the original
strain or active ingredient in our product
[SPEAKER_01]: Root Shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being scientists you always look for
what else is out there that can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being businessmen you always want to have
something interesting to talk about you
[SPEAKER_01]: always want to try to improve your
products to offer more efficacy to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and the growers out there in the
real world and so we had some single line
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate strains that were pretty strong
and had attributes in excess of what the
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid strain T22 had.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these strains was classified as G41
it was a trichodermavirins and it had the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to grow in very wet soils and it
liked to attack pathogens found in the
[SPEAKER_01]: group of the oomycetes including pythium
and phytophthora and downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this other strain was mixed with the
T22 hybrid strain the G41 strain and we
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced the product a couple of years
ago called Root Shield Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name Root Shield was pretty good the
name Root Shield Plus we thought we'd keep
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now have two different strains in
the same package and they complement each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and in fact we were granted a patent
on the synergy between these two strains
[SPEAKER_01]: which means they act better together than
either one would alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a heck of a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so you mentioned some effects against
oomycetes which I'm not great at
[SPEAKER_00]: pronouncing either.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the attributes of these
particular strains in terms of the Root
[SPEAKER_00]: Shield Plus that people in cannabis may
see benefit from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned downy mildew for example and
I want to talk about the mildews later in
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are just some some general attributes
associated that you found from these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well these strains are what we call
rhizosphere rhizoplank competent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to grow not just in the soil not
just near the roots but they grab onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and actually coil around them most
importantly root hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we use the name Root Shield we're
truly talking about shielding the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: blocking entrance in the root tissue by
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of their strong attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cling on very tightly and so you know
if you're growing clones either from
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings or seeds you know you want to
protect that newly emerging root tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: and these trichoderms found in Root Shield
Plus will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a wettable powder you can drench
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a granular you can incorporate or
even top dress and water down because they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are little microbes fungi that
will colonize and protect that root and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a pretty good thing shielding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition these fungi produce enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The T-22 strain produces an abundance of
what we call chitinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of your fungal pathogens that try to
attack the roots contain chitin as a sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: moiety in the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other pathogens do not contain as much
chitin in their cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They contain a sugar moiety called a
glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to bore your audience with
the chemical structure but they're close
[SPEAKER_01]: but a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little different spin on a glucose
molecule and this glucan we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: additional strain the G41 that produces an
abundance of glucanases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it attacks different pathogens by
dissolving the cell wall and feeding on it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the T-22 strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So together they produce these enzymes
these chitinases and glucanases that will
[SPEAKER_01]: attack the sugar moieties in most fungal
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these trichoderms not just cling to the
roots but they'll actually attack
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens that get near the roots and stop
them from entering root tissue and in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen studies on fungi that produce
survival structures called sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sclerotinia is one and our friend powdery
mildew produces sclerotia and these excuse
[SPEAKER_01]: me botrytis produces sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is these fungal pathogens produce
survival structures in the soil that allow
[SPEAKER_01]: them to hide from synthetic chemistries
but the trichoderms can sense where they
[SPEAKER_01]: are they'll grow to them wrap around them
and start to digest and feed upon them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these trichoderms found in root-choplus
can lower pathogen levels in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be advantageous because if you
attack pathogens especially those that may
[SPEAKER_01]: grow out of the soil and attack the
foliage if you suppress them in the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have less potential when they
surface out of the ground to possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: attack the foliage and flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah now in a healthy ecosystem are you
seeing persistence with these trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they lasting or is this something that
needs to be applied on a fairly regular
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule if you're doing intensive
cropping like you would be with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I know out there people listening
would love to have something that lasts
[SPEAKER_01]: forever but the EPA says that's a no-no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want you to release something
that's invasive that will take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see with our trichodermas is
that they'll colonize the root tissue in a
[SPEAKER_01]: protective level for eight up to 12 weeks
depending upon the organic level of the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic levels tend to encourage these
trichodermas to persist but after 12 weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: we see these levels begin to drop and by
16 weeks there's no appreciable protection
[SPEAKER_01]: with these strains of trichoderma found in
root shield plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't last forever and the other
interesting point is that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: compatibility we know with Michael Reisey
golly back in the 1980s late 1980s and
[SPEAKER_01]: early 1990s we were doing work with the
USDA Dr. Bob Lumsden who was able to show
[SPEAKER_01]: that our strains of trichoderma had no
negative effect or little or no negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on Michael Reisey and Dr. Mary
Hausbeck from Michigan State University
[SPEAKER_01]: also published and saw less than a 10% or
about a 10% reduction in Michael Reisey
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration when using these strains of
trichoderma which is not significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't always know why they're
compatible but when we place them together
[SPEAKER_01]: they they seem to not have a negative
effect on each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good thing but I like to say
that doesn't hold for all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and all the different species of
trichoderma that may be offered to you out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said a lot of these strains may
produce metabolites that are have a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effect on plants or may have a
negative effect on Michael Reisey that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why some people say you can mix
trichoderma Michael Reisey others say I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know others say you can't it depends
on the strain and that's very important to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand not all strains of trichoderma
are the same not all humans are the same
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's important to understand the strain
and ask the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey company do you know what your strains
are compatible with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you highlighted that because this
is something that you and I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: last week as well off-air and for me one
of the challenges I see is I see these
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial products and you know and
here's one that I'm just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: label it has 83 propugals per gram of
glomus interaticis and glomus maciae and
[SPEAKER_00]: then 313 thousand 125 propugals per gram
of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a preponderance of trichoderma
in there at concentrations you know
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially higher than the amount of
mycorrhizae in the product you know even
[SPEAKER_00]: though the product is marketed as a
mycorrhizal product and you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: company claims that these things play nice
together but we don't really know you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an end user without seeing a lot of
research to support it so I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: caution listeners to do their homework and
realize too what's on the label isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always what's actually in the product too
that's a whole nother challenge that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the Oregon Department of
Agriculture has been testing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: products and finding that with microbials
you don't always get what you think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting when we're talking across the
board here but you know I have I have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried root shield before I think I think
you guys do a great job with your products
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that work in terms of shelf life
with the root shield and root shield plus
[SPEAKER_00]: are people able to walk into a store
purchase it I know I ordered online and
[SPEAKER_00]: had it shipped directly from you guys to
me and this was this is quite a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: back but how does how does shelf life and
those sorts of things stability come into
[SPEAKER_01]: play with microbial product like this well
just to make sure everybody can find this
[SPEAKER_01]: information on their own please check out
our website www.bio-worksinc.com because
[SPEAKER_01]: on there we have compatibility information
shelf life and storage information if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to treat 10 plants or 10,000 acres we
have small volume and large volume
[SPEAKER_01]: calculations for you we have a very high
quality expertise staff so ask the expert
[SPEAKER_01]: area on our websites and then your
questions give us a call we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: PhDs we have a hundred plus years of
expertise and experience with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people we have in our technical services
and our biological program managers along
[SPEAKER_01]: with our people like myself our biological
solutions advisors we we throw a team
[SPEAKER_01]: effort of trying to give you an answer but
to answer your question quickly you know
[SPEAKER_01]: with our products it's temperature
dependent most trichoderms they are
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature dependent so if you stored at
room temperature you can get six months in
[SPEAKER_01]: the refrigerator you'll get longer in the
freezer it stores even longer so we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf life table based upon temperature
can you walk into a store and buy our
[SPEAKER_01]: products there is a chance you can however
we typically try to direct people through
[SPEAKER_01]: our distribution channel and again on our
homepage if you click at the top or if you
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the top there's a button where to
buy into the state into the country
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're in multiple countries and
you will see a listing of our distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: and a way to contact them so we try to do
it that way we do have a retail site we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple of retail outlets Johnny
select seeds Arbico and others that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can order from so we try to make it easy
to get it from you or get it from us to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to you we try to give you shelf
life information tables that you can print
[SPEAKER_01]: off they're all PDFs we've got
compatibility with other biologicals
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers adjuvants and other synthetic
inputs I mean here are fungi that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would expect not to be able to be mixed
with chemical fungicides but they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: there's many you can because the premise
behind biologicals root shield plus and
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else is you want to prevent you
don't want to try to cure and in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and hemp your toolboxes are limited and
what you have available and so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent and not have to go to that toolbox
for a hammer because you don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of hammers but prevent and not only
preventative from a root protective aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: but preventative from a foliar aspect you
know things can get out of hand real fast
[SPEAKER_01]: above the ground and if you don't have
some preventative out there you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to lose some plants you're going to lose
some flowers that's a good segue into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next part of our conversation but before
we do i had one last question about
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma specifically the ones that you
are offering do those have offer any
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance in regards to the microbial
loop or nutrient cycling in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health or plant growth beyond the disease
resistance potential how much time you got
[SPEAKER_01]: that oh we we published a paper out of the
station called solubalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration of inorganic nutrients by
trichoderma strain t22 don't ask me to say
[SPEAKER_01]: it again and to answer your question not
just have just yes but heck yes these are
[SPEAKER_01]: trichodermas have the ability to
solubilize insoluble nutrients we would
[SPEAKER_01]: take culture filtrate from strain t22 we'd
put rock phosphate in it put it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: shaker overnight come back in the next day
and it was gone somebody stole the rock no
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't it was dissolved because our
trichodermas produce reducing agent
[SPEAKER_01]: chelating agents they're part of the
recycling of food back to the root tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: in addition and this is a published paper
in addition another paper was published
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the lab from a scientist visiting
from Taiwan again last century and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to show that utilizing our
trichoderma strains as a soil drench that
[SPEAKER_01]: they could inhibit viral uptake by the
plant tissue I got a paper in front of me
[SPEAKER_01]: right now I'm taking a look at that called
trichoderma carcinium t22 induces induces
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic resistance in tomato infected by
cucumber mosaic virus we're seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: trichodermas can turn on what's called
induced systemic resistance within that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant it helps produce things like
phytoalexins which are the antibodies of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant it's quite fascinating in fact we
did a study again a while ago at Texas A&M
[SPEAKER_01]: on cotton seedlings out of the strains and
with t22 we saw a tenfold increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: phytoalexin production in the roots and
again the phytoalexins are one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant hormones that are produced as a
response to a problem infection they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the so-called antibodies in a plant they
move from the roots up and so to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your question yes we there's a lot of
publications on this if you would just
[SPEAKER_01]: search solubilization or or mycoparasitism
or induced systemic resistance in t22
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see a lot of papers
popping up so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: publications we try to make sure that we
have data to support what we say that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great that's I love that I'm gonna
put some links up on the podcast page to
[SPEAKER_00]: your website as well as some of the
publicly available papers you and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that after the podcast and we
can put some of those up and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to put you in touch with Dr. Ben
Higgins to start maybe doing some research
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis here with some of these things
because I think that's really exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are doing I've been talking
to scientists around the country we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to set up studies to see how metabolite
production is enhanced reduced altered
[SPEAKER_01]: using our inputs out we look forward to
having that data we look forward to those
[SPEAKER_01]: studies so please anybody out there we
want to work and have data we we've
[SPEAKER_01]: strived for many many decades to offer
information so you you're not guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using facts and figures to guide
your programs yeah that's I totally agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with you on that I think that's wonderful
what you guys are doing you had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the above-ground challenges which
was something that I was really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to talking about with your
background in pathology so one of the big
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges in cannabis is powdery mildew
can you talk a little bit about what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: how it relates to cannabis and how we
might be able to better treat and prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: it well powdery mildew it's tough I mean
it attacks cannabis powdery mildew is just
[SPEAKER_01]: a general name for many many different
genera that are included in the grouping
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew 30 plus and they're finding
more all the time so it's pretty broad
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum it typically occurs on the upper
leaf surface as a white powdery kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hyphy little hairs and and so it's it's
unique in that it's an obligate parasite
[SPEAKER_01]: so it likes living tissue to grow and
develop it it's unusual in that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: require free moisture to germinate you
know things like botrytis the free
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture the thing can go crazy quickly
this thing doesn't need free moisture you
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually pull moisture out of
atmospheric water we actually call
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity so it can get out of hand it
likes to thrive between temperatures of 60
[SPEAKER_01]: to 72 if you can raise the temperature in
your greenhouse or your atmospheric
[SPEAKER_01]: control unit to about 75 it just doesn't
thrive real well it's interesting in that
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew needs an open wound or a
cut or a stoma to enter leaf tissue it
[SPEAKER_01]: differs in you know botrytis and downy in
that they'll make enzymes and dissolve
[SPEAKER_01]: their way through the cuticle and the
epidermis and the leaf tissue powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew really doesn't do that so you know
you can use certain products certain
[SPEAKER_01]: contact killers certain hammers and some
people will even say that's a curative
[SPEAKER_01]: effect well powdery doesn't enter quickly
so I don't know if it's curative you just
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to whack it before it got into
plant tissue so it's a it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal problem to control it just get the
humidity down get it down to 45 percent if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can I know that's pretty low but that
really discourages powdery mildew that or
[SPEAKER_01]: get the temperature in your greenhouse
around 75 to discourage it you know with
[SPEAKER_01]: any pathogen out there pad that may harm a
plant it's always good to find the best
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics available and I know there's a
bunch of work being done in cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics because resistant varieties you
know that there's nothing a total
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant but more if you can lower
pressure significantly than some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts and biologicals may be all you'll
ever need to keep things from getting
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously out of hand if you use them
preventatively so it is a very common
[SPEAKER_01]: problem powdery mildew I mean golly the
multiple genera can probably attack over
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,500 different types of plants so it's a
very common problem so I have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: questions here let's start with the do I
need to worry about my the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: on my comfrey or the powdery mildew on my
squash infecting my cannabis plant in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden if I was saying a greenhouse or
outdoors or is there is there a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: species or strain that's affecting
cannabis that's that's different than what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing on these other vegetables or
other crops or do you know well sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: they can jump from one crop to the other
just depends upon the strain of the of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen you know some of these pathogens
are more crop specific some of them aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's always best if you if you got
other plants in there with this powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew it may not be a bad idea that the
treat those plants but again it just it
[SPEAKER_00]: just depends so what I see you know as
someone who grows a fair number of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables with my squash and stuff when I
start getting the colder nights I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'll have like a really hot sunny day
and then the next day it'll it'll rain or
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a really cold night some sort of
water event and then I'll start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew a day or two later popping
up and the spore pressure just seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: get really high and I can spray that that
pumpkin plant or squash plant with an
[SPEAKER_00]: oil-based solution that will you know kill
that powdery mildew but it doesn't it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to just keep coming right back you
know four or five days later I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew again and with cannabis I
know you can't you can't spray a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in flower I want to talk a little
more about the humidian temperature thing
[SPEAKER_00]: but what are your thoughts in terms of
treatment so when we're contact killing
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew is it because of the spore
pressure in the air that we're just seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing more pop up like do we need
to control that or is the plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged at that point it has easy access
and it's just going to keep coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: once we've seen it on a plant does that
make sense pathogens pathogens are like
[SPEAKER_01]: the IRS they never go away they're always
out there they're always wanting to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something it just takes the right
environmental trigger to turn them on and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildews can survive up to three
years in plant debris so you know they
[SPEAKER_01]: they have persistence others can survive
for decades but other pathogens but
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew can survive in overwinter
and plant debris and survive a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: winters up to three years in plant debris
so it's always out there it's good to use
[SPEAKER_01]: as you said some of these contact hammers
especially when the environment as you
[SPEAKER_01]: described starts to favor the occurrence
because you know under certain
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions and triggers a
couple of days later it's happening so
[SPEAKER_01]: when that trigger hits let's get out to
prevent it as you mentioned oils oils are
[SPEAKER_01]: a great contact we have an oil I will
mention it it's called self oil X the only
[SPEAKER_01]: reason I mention it that if you've ever
used an oil that looks like milk that's
[SPEAKER_01]: self oil X it's an emulsified oil to give
it charge so it will react with water and
[SPEAKER_01]: it has some attributes from that aspect
but other things you can use besides oils
[SPEAKER_01]: for these foliar pathogens or soaps soaps
can be effective but be careful they can
[SPEAKER_01]: weaken the cuticle do other things and
then you have a we have a salt-based
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry called milstock it's a potassium
bicarbonate that will desiccate and not
[SPEAKER_01]: allow fungal spores to either germinate or
grow very well because of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: desiccation properties and also the pH
alteration properties of this product you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've also done some experience with
there's an enzyme in milk raw milk
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently too that has some efficacy I
know that there's some specific biological
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides as well you know products like
actinivate but I haven't had amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: success with the like streptomyces and
some of those other ones personally I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to say that they don't work but
for me a lot of these other applications
[SPEAKER_00]: well the milk shoot it dries and it looks
like powdery mildew on your leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: which to me was a that was a deal-breaker
but the the streptomyces I felt like I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply it like every few days like I
wasn't getting very strong suppression
[SPEAKER_00]: personally and this is anecdotal purely
anecdotal in my experience the oils all
[SPEAKER_00]: worked really well I haven't done anything
with potassium bicarbonate but at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day I find I'm still it's nothing
completely wipes it out once I see it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I feel like I'm battling it until I
crop have you had any success or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with with people having more
success with that and then if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning that plant what are the risks
associated with besides let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: being a weak genetic line or poorly
resistant to powdered mildew are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: other risks of re inoculating it or
bringing it back into our into our
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment yes there's always
risks when you take that's why on your
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant you should do your best
people sometimes think our mom's fine I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to worry about her well mom
needs to be taken care of too and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know before taking cuttings I'd encourage
people to put some some one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: products down you know salt soaps oils and
you mentioned the streptomyces Ted have
[SPEAKER_01]: you ever made use of products that contain
a bacillus different species but let the
[SPEAKER_01]: Phyllis subtilis these bacteria had go
ahead have you ever used a bacillus before
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I'm there was one I got from this
from Wilbur Ellis back in the day and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to remember the name of it the
commercial name maybe it'll come to me
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're chatting oh that was bacillus
amylolequifaceans or what heck anyway I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that product I'm trying to remember
to sorry you're both having a I'm having a
[SPEAKER_01]: senior moment you're just but and and what
I like to talk about is and I'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: mention now is I like the the hammer
residual concept I like to mix these salt
[SPEAKER_01]: soaps and oils with a biological that may
have some residual activity based upon its
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism of action and so you know you
are right some of these you know hammers
[SPEAKER_01]: the oils or salts they they got to be
reapplied because they don't last a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time that's a good thing or a bad thing
but they don't have a lot of residuals so
[SPEAKER_01]: why not mix it with a something with a
residual and there's some some decent
[SPEAKER_01]: bacillus based products out there we
happen to have one called feast it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacillus subtilis strength USP 713 for
those of you that want to know that and
[SPEAKER_01]: got compatibility got shelf life info and
these bacteria in general pad their their
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism of action is to produce
metabolites that we call them sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: cyclic lipopeptides and and bio
surfactants to drill for as they've all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of names but these metabolites have
the ability to make holes in cell walls
[SPEAKER_01]: and cell membranes and cells can bleed to
death they can collapse and those
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites can have some can have some
residual activity on the foliage so you
[SPEAKER_01]: mix in a lot of our programs you'll see us
recommend mixing our bicarbonate mill stop
[SPEAKER_01]: which will help spread and stick the
metabolites with these which has a
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite so you get a quick direct kill
on contact and then you get a residual
[SPEAKER_01]: activity from the metabolites found in see
so you know that's where you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: putting these biologicals together in your
programs for a quick kill in a residual
[SPEAKER_01]: activity so you don't have to come out so
often so I looked up the product it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was called Sonata it's a bacillus that's
it pumilis I'm terrible at I'm terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: with these names okay but so one thing I
want to go jump back to you was regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and temperature and
humidity so one of the one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges you know traditionally people
would would grow cannabis during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower cycle and just immediately drop the
humidity down into the 40s for that very
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that you mentioned because the the
molds and mildews just don't don't enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of humidity but I find what we
found and again this is this is still
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly anecdotal but by using you know a
vapor pressure differential and raising
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity relative to the temperature
the plant seems to be more resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: these particular mildews than prior
problems so we've had some cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that have rather than you know
their traditional dropping the community
[SPEAKER_00]: they've actually raised the humidity level
in the rooms and raised the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and by doing so they've been able to
reduce the amount of powdery mildew that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been they've seen expressed on the
leaf on the leaf tissue in cannabis I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's a great idea and I've seen
people do that too here in Florida when I
[SPEAKER_01]: go visit and elsewhere and yeah because as
you raise the temperature the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: changes but the most important thing is
about 75 or higher powdery just doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like to grow well it just doesn't so raise
it up a little bit even if the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: goes up because the temperature is still
not conducive for this problem to get out
[SPEAKER_01]: of hand and you remember the the pathogen
and insect and pest triangle you need the
[SPEAKER_01]: host you need the problem and you need the
right environment and so raising that
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature even if the humidity goes up
it's still okay because you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow because of warmer temperatures
the powdery to get out of hand so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that work too I agree with you so
we've been we've been starting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher humidity and then slowly tapering
it down towards the end of flower to help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent botrytis because it seems like as
the plant is starting to senesce as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting later in the crop cycle we're more
at risk for botrytis as the flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: developing and it seems that if we don't
drop that humidity towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle we're going to still have some
botrytis challenges what can you tell can
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about botrytis and sort of how it
relates to powdery mildew and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other things because one of the
issues here is we can't spray a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on cannabis flowers in flowering
cycles and even the microbials are really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging because some states are
testing for microbials but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating between you know different
types you know gram-negative bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things just microbial
biomass is all they're looking at and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of challenges around testing
that just from a legal perspective make it
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to treat these things if we
don't get ahead of them early on oh no
[SPEAKER_01]: question about it Ted no question about it
and they'll do a total microbial fungi and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and things and that's why you know
with some of our microbial living products
[SPEAKER_01]: we recommend stop applying you know before
you know harvest of flowers because our
[SPEAKER_01]: goal is to ultimately go to these testing
labs and set up primers and assays to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow distinction of what's there so you
can negate the use of some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial biologicals because they are
darn good tools that offer you know
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing negative to the plants just all of
my products have
[SPEAKER_01]: at least one formulation organically
certified I mean if you were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: something you could pick and eat tomatoes
and an apple we have zero pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: intervals with our products because they
don't produce anything toxic but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still testing going on to look at total
microbes so that's where you may want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make use of some of your non-living
biologicals some of these oils and salts
[SPEAKER_01]: and soaps you know before that because
what happens is when the flower closes up
[SPEAKER_01]: and gets nice and dense it holds moisture
in there and that's where problems can get
[SPEAKER_01]: out of hand inside that flower and I know
you can't use vials so before it closes
[SPEAKER_01]: too tight maybe use one of these other
inputs that could be that could be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know the thing with botrytis is it
differs from powdery mildew botrytis needs
[SPEAKER_01]: free moisture to germinate so it likes it
when it's wet out so botrytis you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to water plants at the end of the day
and leave them wet all night you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis popping up the next day you don't
want to do that so you want to you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your plants dry so I know people that
have issues with botrytis will space
[SPEAKER_01]: plants a little more so they can dry
others will turn on fans to help dry
[SPEAKER_01]: plants now you don't want to do that with
botrytis because botrytis is dispersed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind so when botrytis sporulates on
the soil surface and you turn fans on all
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing is spreading it so you got to
be careful with airflow and botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas airflow can help with powdery
mildew and other issues it's not good to
[SPEAKER_01]: have good airflow because it can cause
spore dispersal with botrytis of botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're just a little bit different
botrytis will produce chitinases and
[SPEAKER_01]: lipases enzymes that allow it to penetrate
right through the leaf surface and not
[SPEAKER_01]: have to worry about finding an opening
available to it so it's a it's a tough one
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis is different from powdery in that
you know there's there's multiple species
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis is the genus name but there's
multiple species fortunately enough these
[SPEAKER_01]: species are more host specific so as I
mentioned with your powdery mildew you got
[SPEAKER_01]: some cucumbers or something near some
medicinal plants I wouldn't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a chance not always but there's a
chance less of a chance with botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're more specific but you've
got one certain species botrytis cinerea
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got 11 years of college on pad so I
can pronounce these names pretty well I
[SPEAKER_01]: better be able to and this botrytis
cinerea you know it's a beggar out there
[SPEAKER_01]: it can attack over 200 different plants
both monocots and dicots so it's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: gnarly one and you you know you buy
strawberries and you put them in your
[SPEAKER_01]: refrigerator right why because I want to
eat them in two three weeks well you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: do that there's some something gray
growing on that that's that's botrytis we
[SPEAKER_01]: call it gray mold and you know even the
refrigerated temperatures of 46 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit it can grow after time so it
likes it cool it likes it moist so it
[SPEAKER_01]: differs than powder you won't see powdery
growing in your fridge I can't imagine so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little bit different but and on a
good side botrytis doesn't survive for
[SPEAKER_01]: three years like powdery does botrytis you
know a couple of weeks to a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months maybe a little longer but it's and
this is a neat one and botrytis is related
[SPEAKER_01]: to sclerotinia it's in the same family and
they they form these survival structures
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil and you know at Cornell we
used to do studies looking at how well
[SPEAKER_01]: these sclerotias could be colonized by our
different strains and root shield plus and
[SPEAKER_01]: they did a pretty good job of growing on
them and knocking them out so that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about earlier the suppressive
nature of these strains to suppress
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens in the soil before they can
surface and do foliar damage so can you
[SPEAKER_00]: explain to me sort of the the physical
mechanisms associated with botrytis and
[SPEAKER_00]: also you touched on its life cycle a
little bit here can you sort of explain
[SPEAKER_00]: how it survives and exactly what it does
to attacking the plant well the survival
[SPEAKER_01]: structures are called sclerotia there's
these little they produce hyphae and other
[SPEAKER_01]: materials that encapsulate the survival
spores and the surviving cells inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: and when the right environment is is there
again it can be you know they thrive from
[SPEAKER_01]: about 60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit so they
thrive at about the same temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges powdery but they can survive in
much cooler environments and again you get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough moisture a good rain and you got
these temperatures in the soil they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come out of hiding they're going
to grow to the soil surface the the
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis is going to sporulate the spores
are going to be windblown and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: they they they move around in the in the
environment botrytis also as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go directly through the cuticle
through the epidermis into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue but especially with tritocinuria
they actually produce small RNA molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: that can affect the plant's immune system
so some of these pathogens when they
[SPEAKER_01]: attack they'll turn the plant's defense
system off and they have free reign at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time so did I did I answer the
question tab like you yeah so I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: the try to spread really quickly like oh
yeah take over here and I've seen people
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to treat it in a variety of ways
from everything from hydrogen peroxide to
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting off and wounding that particular
bud and taking it away from the room but
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day they all feel like
losing battles once you've spotted it
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of you're kind of in trouble
it seems like what would be the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to address it and how quickly can it
really spread it's seems like it just it
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads like wildfire in my experience
once it's established in a room but can
[SPEAKER_01]: you touch on those those things a little
bit yeah it I mean if you got free
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in the right temperature the
right environment in eight hours it can
[SPEAKER_01]: germinate it eight to twelve hours so in
half a day you got the right conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: it's germinating it's growing and it's
producing enzymes going right inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf tissue so it's you can't get it
with contact so that's why when you you
[SPEAKER_01]: either have a history or you start to see
a few plants having issues that's when you
[SPEAKER_01]: got a quarantine that problem and hit it
with some some contacts also there are
[SPEAKER_01]: some biologicals that are available again
mix some of these hammers these salt soaps
[SPEAKER_01]: and oils with something living again our
cease product is helpful but we brought in
[SPEAKER_01]: a new fungus from New Zealand Australia
region to add a couple of years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: started testing it and it's a unique
biological in that most biologicals either
[SPEAKER_01]: attack a host or produce metabolites that
are detrimental to the target or other
[SPEAKER_01]: things this this fungus and it's it's
technically called Eulocladium Udomansi
[SPEAKER_01]: strain U3 is the name U2 was taken and
this particular strain of fungus is called
[SPEAKER_01]: technically an antagonist so when cells
finesse or die they rupture and they
[SPEAKER_01]: release moisture and nutrients and
pathogens and insects can sense sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: these volatiles and and and move or grow
towards these these compromised cells well
[SPEAKER_01]: this fungus will actually grow on those
compromised cells this this product and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about controlling both
Botrytis and our product is called
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrystop so I think you know what it
controls and it's an antagonist that out
[SPEAKER_01]: competes nick occupation of ruptured cells
so as a preventative or as a quarantine
[SPEAKER_01]: preventative you spray this out on the
foliage and it will colonize and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: however too close to harvest it may
continue to grow so we tell people and
[SPEAKER_01]: again we have programs for cannabis
production on our website called the
[SPEAKER_01]: bioworks cannabis program and you'll read
about when we tell you to stop applying
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbes based upon microbial
testing that's being done but this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: real good tool in the toolbox to control
Botrytis and other foliar issues by sheer
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for niche occupation so once
we have once I spot Botrytis on a on a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: in a room can I safely assume that the
spore pressure in that room is is already
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly high or can I potentially catch it
early enough and just remove see when you
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the bud you're wounding the plant
and I guess creating potentially other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues you know another place for yeah
pathogen and disease but what what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think I mean for people who can't apply
microbials and can't harvest immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: what other options really are there if any
for you know preserving your crop it
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on I've been in facilities no
names but I've been in there where I saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of Botrytis starting to creep
up and they cut it out and had no issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with that plant you know sometimes people
will come back with some of these contact
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to help protect that wound kind
of like a temporary band-aid that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: done I like to tell people if you can and
it's small enough try to cut it out if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's getting out of hand remove it then
ask yourself do I have a lot of air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation here in this room if I do and
the problem is Botrytis I may have spread
[SPEAKER_01]: spores I better get out with some sort of
contact preventative and again salt soaps
[SPEAKER_01]: and oils I don't know but I think they'd
be tough to detect and testing for for you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I just don't I think they would be
okay again we're trying to as a company
[SPEAKER_01]: work closer with some of these testing
labs to be able to give you a clearer
[SPEAKER_01]: answer on when these things can be applied
when the last time they should be applied
[SPEAKER_01]: so again I know you're gonna damage or
maybe hurt a plant by trimming it but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can trim it a little bit maybe come in
with something to protect that like an oil
[SPEAKER_01]: that wound you could save that plant but
it's scouting that key answer to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is scouting don't get lazy get
out and look at your plants and I know in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis there's a lot of people out there
and a lot of eyes so your whole entire
[SPEAKER_01]: staff should be trained to go out and
scout and if they see something funny
[SPEAKER_01]: report it just don't ignore it so yeah and
I want to highlight the importance of good
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics too I mean I've seen plants
covered in Botrytis and powdered mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: next to plants that don't even seem to
care because they just have that innate
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in them and you know some
people they're like this is just the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar of cannabis I've ever grown you
know it's the one that everyone wants at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day if if it gets Botrytis
every single time I probably wouldn't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it and a lot of people get stuck in that
world of sort of that market need to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: something versus what's practical in their
environment so that's a challenge but
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics is such a big role at the end of
the day it really I think gets overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of ways people are always trying
to treat potentially plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically weak and trying to keep them
healthy and that's a real challenge oh I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't agree with you more I think I
said earlier Tad that you know with the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper genetics you really won't have too
many issues but if you do your biologicals
[SPEAKER_01]: will work well because the pressure didn't
get out of hand so rapidly and I like you
[SPEAKER_01]: have been in facilities where there's
different varieties side by side one's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ate up by something the other one
looks beautiful I'll say well how come
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not growing more of this one well
this one what everybody wants and I said
[SPEAKER_01]: well send it to your sister facility you
guys should concentrate on this variety
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know how to grow it well I
mean yeah genetics are so important and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see so much research be done
on genetics in the next couple of years it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be so nice so I wanted to jump
back to powdery mildew I had another
[SPEAKER_00]: question from a plant pathology
perspective we see lately you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: fans and airflow and a lot of growers are
removing quite a few quite a few leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves as a way of allowing better
airflow through the plant which in general
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to agree with now my question is
sort of in terms of spreading powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew you mentioned that with botrytis
those spores are riding in the air what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with powdery mildew and what's in
the you know how much leaf tissue should
[SPEAKER_00]: we be removing in a given environment or a
given canopy as a way of optimizing our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants chance for success against these
against these pathogens because when when
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a space that's like when we get too
many leaves or two dents of a canopy in
[SPEAKER_00]: you dig into that canopy not only can you
not scout it but you see you do see that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the powdery mildew wants to wants to
live you know the areas that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: getting good airflow so what kind of
recommendations would you have around sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of airflow and these pathogens well again
but powdery air flows important I mean and
[SPEAKER_01]: and so de-leafing can be a technique to
help reduce the ability of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a foothold so I believe in
de-leafing again how much should you do
[SPEAKER_01]: well do enough that you know you're
getting good airflow number one number two
[SPEAKER_01]: is de-leaf enough that you know you can
scout in the middle of something you know
[SPEAKER_01]: easier than having to crawl in there so I
mean de-leafing offers a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages so but powdery likes to spread
more by water splashing on people's
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes it's not blown around it's not
wind dispersed or air dispersed like like
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis so that's an advantage of keeping
that airflow up but again with powdery the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is important get it up there
we talked about that at 75 or a little
[SPEAKER_01]: higher if you can and and you know powdery
doesn't need free moisture botrytis does
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery can you can get good airflow and
stop it from getting a foothold the
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis it'll help disperse it so there's
no easy solution or answer to that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just what's your biggest problem you know
play around with airflow watch over
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilization I mean you know too much
fertilizer can alter the metabolites being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by these medicinal plants but
also it can weaken and stress a plant we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that in ornamental plants the
flowering plants you know if you add too
[SPEAKER_01]: much nitrogen pythium can attack the roots
more effectively white flies can sense a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is stressed and attack more
effectively in fact you know and you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have all heard about this some of these
so-called plant nutrition products
[SPEAKER_01]: offering the ability to reduce plant
stress when plants get stressed they give
[SPEAKER_01]: off volatiles and these volatiles are like
gases ethylene is one that plants give off
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene when they're stressed and issues
can sense and detect that ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: emission and especially insects and go and
attack that plant so be be cautious of too
[SPEAKER_01]: much cutting too much damage to a plant
there are we have a plant nutrition called
[SPEAKER_01]: on guard and for a lack of better terms
this this amino acid-based plant nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: with a five zero zero for lack of better
terms I'm gonna throw this out there is I
[SPEAKER_01]: call it Prozac for plants it reduces plant
stress and in addition it is what I also
[SPEAKER_01]: call an uber it helps transport nutrients
inside the plant more effectively and
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently so you can utilize less
nutrients save money and not have salt
[SPEAKER_01]: built up so there are ways to try to
reduce stress and plants and I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Florida hired a bio
stimulant specialist a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is dr. Shinsky Aga Hara and he is
working on the use of bio stimulants
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you can reduce plant stress
plants are capable on their own of
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting off a lot of diseases and
pathogens and insects number one number
[SPEAKER_01]: two is they're not producing volatiles
that help entice problems to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: faster and if you can uptake nutrients
more effectively both your macro and your
[SPEAKER_01]: minor nutrients the plants going to be
healthier less stress and it can fight off
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of problems on its own yeah I'm glad
you brought up over fertilization because
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen what you're what you're
talking about there in relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and have you seen that sort of
research done in an organic system where
[SPEAKER_00]: say that nitrogen may have been applied in
the form of I don't know fish meal or
[SPEAKER_00]: feather meal or some other form that's not
immediately available or chelated where
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know you're waiting for the
microbes to break it down into a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available form are you seeing I mean I've
seen where over application of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products will cause bacterial blooms which
and also raise the temperature of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants don't like obviously but are
you seeing the same challenges around over
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization in organic soils I guess or
have you seen research on that I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: some research research is continuing and
there's a great deal of research out there
[SPEAKER_01]: on organic production because one of the
limiting factors in organic production is
[SPEAKER_01]: the availability of good organic sources
of nitrogen that are either too available
[SPEAKER_01]: or not available and and you're other
needed elements so work is being done I I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't sit here and quote you on any of it
because a lot of it's still being
[SPEAKER_01]: conducted I know here in Florida in the
southeast in general I hang out a lot when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in Mexico doing work is there's
more and more interest in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: organic based inputs and in fact we
started a line a couple of years ago of
[SPEAKER_01]: biological fertilizers we call them where
your nutrients are not readily released by
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture temperature like a control
release fertilizers you literally need a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil with good biology to release
the NPK because they are released by
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes feeding on these dried granular
materials and not by moisture and
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature like a lot of control releases
are so there's a lot of interest in this
[SPEAKER_01]: area we as a company have interest in this
area we'd like to develop specific plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients for you the cannabis needs and a
lot of work is being done in this area
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a lot of products out there Chad
there are more products I mean darn when I
[SPEAKER_01]: go to shows I see a lot of stuff out there
and when I start asking specific questions
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get specific enough answers I get
a lot of features and benefits but not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of science so I will say there needs
to be a whole lot more work done before
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll know what we need to be doing as far
as proper plant nutrition both in organics
[SPEAKER_00]: and in cannabis production I can't agree
with you more there are a lot of products
[SPEAKER_00]: out there like you said the new ones
coming on the market every day and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard one of the things that Suzanne
and I have had long discussions on and
[SPEAKER_00]: what she had me come down to the bio
control conference to give a talk on was
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically how do we how do we evaluate
or vet all of these products you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the questions as growers or end
consumers do we need to be asking these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to know not only that what we're
putting on our on our plants is effective
[SPEAKER_00]: but that it's even just as a low bar just
safe for the end consumer because there
[SPEAKER_00]: have been some companies in the past that
have been less than honest with us about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're putting in their product and
so there's some challenges around that too
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah this fertilizer thing I think is
really interesting so I 'm excited to see
[SPEAKER_00]: more research on the organic side come out
in relationship to optimal nutrient levels
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with cannabis and what those
effects are on some of these things like
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned like botrytis and
powdery mildew and I look forward to the
[SPEAKER_01]: day we can do more research to see how our
products and other types of biologicals
[SPEAKER_01]: like ours affect metabolite production
because I think that that is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to be understood and measured
yeah well Chris I know I know people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna yell at me because you're you're a
smart guy I'm sure I didn't ask all the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I should have asked I'd love to
get you back on here at some point to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up but I really appreciate your
time today and you're you explaining some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different microbes and pathogens
was really helpful so thank you you're
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome sir and it's been an honor to talk
with you and hopefully I've helped a few
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growers out there and understand
a little bit better about the confusion
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going on there's a whole lot of
products out there being offered to you
[SPEAKER_01]: just ask questions check them out I mean
as a company we have over 25 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: history and ornamentals and edible
production and I'd like to say we got all
[SPEAKER_01]: the answers in cannabis and hip production
but we don't we have questions we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with those that would like to work
with us to answer some of those questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the only way we're gonna get
things done and as importantly Tad we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that we we have some sort of
system in place in the future to certify
[SPEAKER_01]: or just to say these products have been
shown to help these haven't because like
[SPEAKER_01]: you said there's a lot of products out
there there's a there's a lot of fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: products I don't want to see anybody get
harmed by fecal coliforms or any anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms so be careful understand what
you're doing it may make sense to you the
[SPEAKER_01]: person presenting the product may have
made sense to you but ask around see what
[SPEAKER_01]: people are using check out check out the
company's website see what they can offer
[SPEAKER_01]: if they can't answer a whole lot of
questions I'd have a whole lot of concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: about working with them I think that's
great advice yeah I appreciate that and
[SPEAKER_00]: people I will put links to your website
like I said and some of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that you mentioned on the podcast page so
people can check it out there and thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you very much thank you sir for your time
that
[SPEAKER_00]: was Chris Hayes with BioWorks and you are
listening to the cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussie
