[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'm at Haskell Creek Farms
in Whitefish, Montana with one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: owners, Craig McViney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a tour of the cultivation facility,
which is over in this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just toured that and the extraction stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the main store,
but what they're doing here is really
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm excited to share it with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Craig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then this is Clone Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Clone Lounge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we wanted it a little more humid
in here, so we'd kind of like tuck it in
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the aeroponics keep the humidity
higher as long as we close it off,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they seem to do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our propagation ratio is pretty,
I mean, now that it's the humidity's up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like 90%, 95%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then we, we always address
everything from like youngest to oldest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we transplanted this room three days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still in veg in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just kind of bouncing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go from an old barn to some seriously
upgraded tech here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are gonna ask, these are PIP
racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: PIP shelving.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are VAS vertical airflow solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run CO2 from a big 750 tank right into
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan pumps it, so it just kind of rains
CO2 down on top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then yeah, it's all living soil on PIP
shelving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we run blue mass systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So KISS soil, blue mass systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these are the BIOS lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a new light out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar, but like lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the TI2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and you guys also label your beds like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We label the beds and then we run
everything through a Chultmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the next room, we'll go
upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next room's in like week four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little, it's a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put the shelves in the next one and
go upstairs so you can see it from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from above.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is how you guys using
scaffolding to access stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scaffolding goes right between these
and then you can move these shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just unlock them so you can work on
whatever side you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for you guys, the limitation was space,
square footage and space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really needed to go vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to go vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the beginning, we were limited on
the, the state of Montana measures your
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy space and they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they'll measure this as canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we push everything together,
we can limit our canopy space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can like basically fit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 10,000 square foot canopy
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's plenty, but in the beginning we
had a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to like cram everything
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure, we try to keep 1.2 to 1.4 VPD
in these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I think one of the nicest
things about this grow is that these rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, they never see outside a 1.2 or
1.4 VPD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the big factors there in
controlling the environment for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity and temperature basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then matching that as we drop,
as we drop temperature, we drop humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get that all through this
Trollmaster controller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all runs through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like the Hydro-X Plus?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, we, it's a great system for
controlling everything, but we use a pulse
[SPEAKER_01]: to monitor everything to see, to basically
to double check everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then this is our other flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to close the door?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so we're a little later in
flowering here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're just, just started week
five.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to run another round of
trellis netting on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how do you guys typically finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: We generally, at this point, we probably
won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the cutoff on where we
would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to put some stakes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we ran two on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on the height?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I would, I would say we probably
should have ran another round of trellis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at this point it might be,
it might be a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that just slides in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These just slide in and then they will go
up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not so bad then having that second
level that you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, once you get these in, it's really
easy to work up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to think about what,
why your move is up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause once you know, you don't want to put
it in and then need to go to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the soil's not leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you just pass the plants up or put them
all up there when you go to transplant and
[SPEAKER_03]: then harvest, like passing down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just put them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put all the plants in a bin,
put it up here and then transplant them
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we harvest, we just same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone stays down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone goes up and we just pass them
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an issue with a lot of like dirt
or dust coming down onto the lower level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you always harvest the bottom first?
[SPEAKER_01]: We always harvest the bottom first and we
don't really, when we harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't, we don't pull the roots out or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no dirt comes out during harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just cut the plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pull, we do pull roots,
but we pull roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once everything's all done,
then we pull roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we can go up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a cool view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so this is a second level,
but it's, it's you're, you're like right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good working height.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can adjust the heights on these
shelves all you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just keep it here cause it's about good
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were kind of still trying to find the
sweet spot of how many, how many plants
[SPEAKER_01]: per bed we run anywhere from five to five
to 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're, what we're finding,
but now we're doing a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out exactly like, is it five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it six?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it seven?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, what's the magic number to just
maximize your canopy as quickly as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our original room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not on, um, vertical racks yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we, this is how we first
started with kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we made these beds that we can roll
around, put them on pallets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then these are our original beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our original lights too, which we will be
upgrading this room, uh, probably this
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this will end up being our
biggest room in this facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all the racks and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a matter of trying to time
it out because we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce production for a couple months to
scale this room up.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one of the things we were talking
about that this is probably a great
[SPEAKER_03]: example of is when you, so all of these
beds were treated the same, the exact
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have cultivars that are
reacting very differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming, you know, we're making the
assumption that the nutrient level is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the same across all these
beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all getting approximately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Approximately all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have different cultivars
doing basically taking up different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't need any nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark green.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, I would have, you know,
like this, I would have said, Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is getting a little too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you go over here and we're
lacking nitrogen, have a mobile nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiency going on with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, this is where, and Craig and I are
having discussion about this today with
[SPEAKER_03]: Terry, their head grower, but how do we
address these things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we only want to do one soil test for
this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to keep the soil relatively the
same, not get too caught up on what the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil test is, you know, at the end,
they won't let the plants tell us what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on, but make sure that we're
optimizing health across all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving forward, you and I talked about
doing some light nutrient things for the
[SPEAKER_01]: beds that are maybe needing nutrients,
but without changing the dynamic of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's so that we can amend all
together and not run 30 soil tests to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the, that's sort of the next
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that we talked about
that I think is really interesting is just
[SPEAKER_03]: at first eliminating a lot of the
variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting out with just water,
you know, not doing all the other amending
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get a baseline and then from
there, really improving and adding things
[SPEAKER_03]: as needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this room is getting an upgrade soon in
terms of lighting and some of these other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably put those new bios lights
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the pips shelves already ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vertical air flow systems are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just see that we have to get everything
out because we've got a, the one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the mobile racks is the floor has to
be completely perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any like any variation in the floor has
got to get filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll fill the floor in with epoxy and
raise it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, quarter of an inch
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concrete's settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a good room to talk in
because there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In here that's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's different, there's different,
there's really healthy looking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some that clearly need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back there, there's some
necrosis on the outer leaves and they look
[SPEAKER_01]: like they need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a fun one to dive into a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every bed in theory started out
approximately the exact same.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to just for people who are
curious, we're going to do a slurry pH
[SPEAKER_03]: test, see what that's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look at the water and check the
moisture level in the beds and then come
[SPEAKER_03]: up with a plan from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we wash and process our
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically freeze it, freeze fresh
frozen in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these guys take it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it into hash and then freeze dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, come in here because we keep it
cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Zach and Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we washing right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which tested almost 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, this is the fourth wash and we're
getting to, you know, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, but I'll show you what the first poll
looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first poll off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a pair of the two right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, yeah, this melted
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice stuff though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably yielding, I would guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second and third polls too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to get like probably 5%
yields, whether if I had to guess where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at, what I think we're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a living fat man though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living fat man was six and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, but we have like 585 grams
of carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which most of that is like primo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be such an attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so full of turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, 70, 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there should be like, there should
be like six or 600, 700 parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how the press goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't blow anything out and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got that bucket filled with
ice pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to siphon water through
the, through the chiller and then into
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty, pretty good little
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumping out the, pump the wastewater out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks guys.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your soil helps grow some fire
entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of an interesting way we do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take these, we roll these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we keep this room at 60 degrees
Fahrenheit, 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get a nice slope here on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these, we just roll these right into
the, right into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can fill them up there and
then roll them back right into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can kind of do like full,
full shelves at a time, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are about dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these, these old, uh,
reefer shipping containers are awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're like super easy to climate
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have issue with condensation
or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we run a D, we run a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, um, you're able to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it exactly at 60, 60 between that,
that many split in the back of that
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this humidifier, it's like almost
always split within, within a less than
[SPEAKER_01]: like about a percent of 60 degrees
Fahrenheit and 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that tray in there that you just saw,
the, uh, the food grade, the darker green
[SPEAKER_00]: food grade stuff that we don't really
spend near as much time washing because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be decarving, put it in the
gummies anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends up becoming truthfully the most
valuable hash in that lab by the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in these gummies because of how
many cans of gummies one wash can make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys use, uh, some unique ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus the standard vegan, GMO free,
gluten free, all the keto, all the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, organic tapioca syrup,
organic, uh, organic sugar, organic color,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, use products, like juice concentrate
to color it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's like organic berries have made
this juice concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I found a, a plant based, uh,
extract, uh, from this company in Berkeley
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use for a preservative,
uh, which we went from having mold
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the very, very beginning of
like trying to figure out if they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be shelf stable or not to not having
mold problems overnight when we started
[SPEAKER_00]: using that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a hundred percent fat extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you guys add herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for, for one of our gummy lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some herbs and adaptogens in there
to enhance the AM, PM sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling that we're going for in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the PM will have a chamomile and
skull cap and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the daytime might have rhodiola
and, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since I have you, um, can you tell
me, I mean, we'll go check it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but can you tell me about the Cannavino?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you're the creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I just want the spiel is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, the Cannavino, we were like
three years ago, we were sitting around
[SPEAKER_00]: and drinking wine and talking about how
cool it'd be to have a product that was
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think there was probably in the
fall that we were doing this and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: generally when we're trying to like simmer
in the drinking for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but it'd be, it's still nice to
have something like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, and so we sought out to do it
and started messing around with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hibiscus tea because it's, uh,
any oxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the nice color of red wine kind of,
and so it seemed like a natural medium to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one thing led to another,
add some botanicals and got closer to a
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually Craig and I went to
Walla Walla and picked up wine barrels
[SPEAKER_00]: from double back winery to try to age this
tea and to give it the characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Cabernet or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, and I think it's not wine,
but I think it's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it definitely had, I, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like people, I think people were
receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people were, uh, were
understood it understood that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: wine, but it's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just putting it in a little
one out shot glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, you know, you pour a glass of
wine, which I've done with family members
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are not into cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in fact, my mother-in-law just quit
referring to it as a narcotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but she, I poured her a glass and she
tried it, which I think is a testament to
[SPEAKER_00]: the product because there's no way she
would have smoked a joint if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting past her on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but she was willing to have a little
glass of cannabino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of removes that
stigmatism and provides a social
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere for cannabis use, which I think
is a great alternative to alcohol for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a little more social experience
than just eating a gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my whole consumption these days is
I'm married to someone who doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, so I sound like I'm hanging out
with Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my whole consumption these days is like
a gummy at before bed or maybe going down
[SPEAKER_00]: to my basement and smoking my puffed up
or, but I'm by myself, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not, you know, not in a social
setting with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much THC is in the cannabino?
[SPEAKER_00]: We went for four to five milligrams per
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this batch has five and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we wanted to make it approachable so
somebody can have a glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that might be a little heavy for some
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just a smaller glass, but it's per
for, for people, general cannabis users,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think four to five milligrams is a
pretty approachable dosage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the, in the bottle, the wine
bottle, how much, uh, 21 total 21
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went for, we went for four servings
per bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pour like a six to eight ounce
glass, have a nice hefty serving and,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still only get a few milligrams as
opposed to having to do a shot that has 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't want to get anywhere near a
hundred milligrams in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were 20 was as high as you want me to
want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were probably in a perfect world would
have been closer to 15 or 16, but okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a subtle cannabis flavor to it,
but you really, the hibiscus tea is really
[SPEAKER_03]: what you, the hibiscus is really where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have a, we have a lady who
does tea blends for us at the store for
[SPEAKER_00]: Haskell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually going to include her in
the next round and maybe try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's more like a Rose or a
white and have it be available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime as we go into summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I think that would probably
appeal to some of our demographic even
[SPEAKER_00]: more than going after a red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'd actually be easier to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that she can give some pale teas
that will have that finished product of a
[SPEAKER_00]: white wine that we can get some of those
floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause white wine is naturally a little bit
more florally and that kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe try to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no one's ever done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love seeing new innovative ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was, that's very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go and we'll go check it out in the
store.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I don't want to get too into
cause there's pollen in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can look in there though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that center plant was Jabba the
Hut, a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're breeding it with lemon fat
man, musty buffalo, and I think black
[SPEAKER_01]: maple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll let those go and then we'll get
the seeds and then we'll run, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: hunts on those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our, this is our store,
Haskell Creek farms and cannabis counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vision here was kind of to create a
much more approachable user friendly,
[SPEAKER_01]: family friendly dispensary that had other
health and wellness products and was more
[SPEAKER_01]: health and wellness focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as we're walking inside,
tell me a little bit about sort of your
[SPEAKER_03]: vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vision was kind of to create
somewhere that, you know, your mother
[SPEAKER_01]: could go when I was my, well, my mother's
she's got Parkinson's disease and she uses
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to help her with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was 70 years old and she's not
that comfortable for her to go into a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and necessarily and get her
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to make a, we wanted to make
something that was more comfortable,
[SPEAKER_01]: more open, gave people a cooler,
cleaner vibe to go use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: get cannabis and other things they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the front of the store,
Haskell Creek farms, all real health and
[SPEAKER_01]: wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been super ethically thought
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically no tox, no toxic chemicals,
no toxic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been, every ingredient in
every product in here has been researched
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly, mostly are all from organic
farmers in the U S and B corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, good, good cleaning
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has sort of a, just a welcoming
family friendly vibe up front here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, I see you guys have some,
some drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that are just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like all these, none of these drinks
have a ton of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, they're all, you know,
I know like this black water is full of
[SPEAKER_01]: fulvic acid and zero sugar, zero,
zero, zero, full of fulvic acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good for gut health immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of the, all the, all the things in
here that's kind of kept in line with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the herbs and supplements.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you had mushroom powders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep moving things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep moving things around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a whole sleep section on
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep section, mushroom powders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, we've got kind of like a more male
section back there where it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've got two or three
deodorants and they're the cleanest
[SPEAKER_01]: deodorant we could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, we've tried to find the best
of everything and put it all in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that people don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went down a rabbit hole one night trying
to find a, find a good deodorant that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't full of aluminum and other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that you've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of like, this is the
delotions like that, the face wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's like your, our deodorant
line right there is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like any one of those is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then tell me about save farmland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So save farmland, we donate a dollar of
every transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one dollar of every sale goes to say
farmland, which is a 501 C three that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have developed that is basically designed
to kind of, kind of curb development
[SPEAKER_01]: around here and keep some of these open
fields as open fields and, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, keep some of these smaller farms
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't, don't quote me on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in the seventies, I think it was
like 88% of the food in this Valley was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in this Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like 7% or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's those numbers aren't completely
accurate, but they're close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty not really a sustainable
future in that people need to kind of grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their own food, at least in their,
in the area they live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've donated 40 acres to save farmland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first big land donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a couple more coming and
we've gotten a lot of people around the
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley involved and they are kind of
rallying behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to over across the way,
develop a farm hub of sorts that would
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully allow younger organic farmers
that maybe couldn't afford a plot of land
[SPEAKER_01]: around here, a plot of land to be able to
grow organic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll be able, eventually this will
all be farmland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now it's, right now it's,
it's hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll, it'll maintain as a hay field
until, you know, we're in the fundraising,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fundraising state of this right now
and trying to get more funds together to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to save more land like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you were saying like this
development over here wasn't here two
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, you know, probably eight
years old and then, yeah, the one around
[SPEAKER_01]: the way is they're still building it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big development going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that was, they're still,
I mean, they put that up in like two,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still, they're, I think they're
finishing the last two houses right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful out here in glacier
national park is just right down this
[SPEAKER_03]: road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right through those two mountains,
right in that Canyon on a clear day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see great Northern mountain
through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our event space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to have events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out here in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is part of Haskell Creek
farms, which is completely different from
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis counter is its own entity and own
registered premise, which has given us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more room in the front to be able
to have an event space like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, your families come and be
able to hang out and play soccer or bocce
[SPEAKER_01]: ball and enjoy a beautiful Montana
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the, with the legalities of
everything, keeping the two different
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two different businesses allows us
to successfully do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you essentially have two different
addresses here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is 1202 and cannabis counter is
1200 Mormon road, one address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we cruise over here and it's
another address.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the event space is technically,
yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event space is technically entirely
different space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the cannabis counter side of
Haskell Creek farms right this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep a similar vibe to the front
where we've really like ethically thought
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, what we carry back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bunch of different glass pipes
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're sourced to be clean and
kind of good companies that we would stand
[SPEAKER_01]: behind just like everything else in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here we have our,
we're a can distributor, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: company out of a beverage company out of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually that's hemp derived THC low
milligram THC beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two milligrams THC four
milligrams CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just a partner of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we don't create that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our Ross and this is actually a,
this is a cheesecake that Tony made a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: infused cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, he's like the mad scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's having fun back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's more of our, these are all
our own products that we make in house and
[SPEAKER_01]: we kind of do a five different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of correlate with sativa and
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the heavy, the heavy sativa
strains, we put more into a focus or
[SPEAKER_01]: socialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrids end up in more socialized create
relax and then heavy indica more sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also base that off the
terpenes in each.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only thing we use with this
terpenes as well to, to kind of give you
[SPEAKER_01]: more of an idea of what, what sort of
feeling you'll get when you consume
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be, you know, a pen,
a tincture or a gummy or a flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here in Montana, you're allowed to open
the jar and smell it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can open that and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that melted strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are hand trimming.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is your gummy line that I
know we talked about that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our, here's our gummy line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was our original gummy line with
these are CO2 extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a daytime and nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell these in twos, fours and 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nighttime are, have like chamomile and
holy basil herbs mixed in with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daytime have ashwagandha and rhodiola
mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our newest cannabis, our newest
gummy line is these, these had,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are hash rods and gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all solventless, hash rods and gummies,
all 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get the categories by washing
around hash and keeping all of our hash
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use, you know, whether it's indica
forward, sativa forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we keep everything, everything's in
its own childproof container and just to
[SPEAKER_01]: give everybody a peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case they have kids or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that we buy in Washington are
usually just in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the exit bags, but it's,
we've gone a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gone that way with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, here's our, here's our flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to line this up to that little
thing in order to get it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the same thing with the pens
and even these, I won't open these cause
[SPEAKER_01]: they got tamper seals on them,
but same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to push those in to get your,
yeah, to get your pens open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all fresh, frozen, live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: All solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the, and this is the can of,
you know, and then these are our deli or
[SPEAKER_01]: bulk deli jars here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use clear jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we keep the light off the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't deteriorate over time,
but it's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks can just tell you how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can also just order however much
you would like, and then we can weigh it
[SPEAKER_01]: out and give it to you that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to bring your own jar,
I don't know where they are, but we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do have jars where you can bring your
own jar and do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the can of, you know, that we just
saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for the tour.
Yeah.
Okay.
