[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw in top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are honored to be interviewing
Steve Solomon, all the way from Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve is the author of numerous books,
most notably Gardening West of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cascades and The Intelligent Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we start off today talking about your
own personal journey and how you came to
[SPEAKER_01]: write The Intelligent Gardener?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which focuses on soil remineralization and
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're asking me to tell you
about my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not enough time to do that so
I'm gonna condense things as best I can
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I wander you stop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to live a life where I worked
as little as possible and I conceived the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that if I could produce as much of my
own stuff as I could and I wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to earn money or pay taxes on it and I
might have a much better lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved from Los Angeles, sold the
business, bought five acres in Oregon that
[SPEAKER_00]: looked real pretty to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew, because I'd read all the organic
gardening literature, I had been
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribing to Organic Gardening magazine
and I've read their books and I knew this
[SPEAKER_00]: was the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I could take any old clay pit or
gravel heap and turn it into a garden of
[SPEAKER_00]: eating as long as I put enough compost in
the ground and maybe some lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found this beautiful green hillside
in Oregon in the springtime and I could
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just five acres of bare land with
some little Douglas fir trees self seating
[SPEAKER_00]: on it and enough that was flat enough that
I could put in a garden and moved on to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put in a big garden and started to
eat out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing after another happened
and a few years later I found myself in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed business, not knowing how to do
it, not knowing how to make any money out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me two years of being in the
business before I learned to make a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically take in every bit of money I
have left, which by the way was $13,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're referring to Territorial Seed
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Territorial Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got capitalized with all the $13,000
that I still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a highly successful seed company,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it became that, but in the first few
years I had no idea how to run a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: business and how to charge for the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn, but I tried to do it
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in a trials ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a seed company that doesn't
have a trials ground, go the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not somebody I'd want to
admire or do business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't use a lot of other language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there I was with a business that was
not making me any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly the first year I made nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took nothing out of it because I just
needed everything to try to do the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year I actually managed to take
$4,000 out of the business and pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: lived on that $4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year after that I took $7,000 out of
the business and then it got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went $14,000, $28,000,
$40,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing well, but in the beginning
it was pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kept me going was the trial
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I had a lady friend at that time who
became Mrs. Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name was Isabel Moser and she ran the
Grey Oak School of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a naturopath who practiced
medicine without a license and had always
[SPEAKER_00]: avoided going to prison for any of the
crimes that she was committing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like practicing medicine without a license
or having somebody with cancer who was
[SPEAKER_00]: dying and sent home to die by the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come and stay with her and try to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They died anyway and then there's
manslaughter charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're aware of how
alternative health is suppressed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, but she was a very brave
outlaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isabel told me that I would be a lot
healthier the more vegetables that I ate
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the fact that I didn't have any
money and had all these trials was really
[SPEAKER_00]: a great opportunity for me and all I
really needed to do was learn how to live
[SPEAKER_00]: on vegetables almost completely and the
more I did that, the healthier I'd become.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well that seems to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that and the more I did that,
the more unhealthful I became.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isabel came and moved in with me and she
started eating the same vegetables and the
[SPEAKER_00]: more she ate them, the less healthful she
became, although she was an
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinarily healthy woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She began to experience brittle hair and
thin fingernails, that sort of stuff and I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to have teeth that got a bit
wobbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of had off days and felt grouchy
and lost energy and things started to seem
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult and life seemed stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after about four years in the business,
I was making enough money and things were
[SPEAKER_00]: organized well enough that we took off six
months and I just didn't do trials that
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went away at the beginning or at
the end of the spring and didn't come back
[SPEAKER_00]: until after Christmas and went to Fiji and
that's where I had this illumination where
[SPEAKER_00]: we just started eating the fruits and
vegetables in the market in Fiji in Suva
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't go to the tourist Fiji.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to the capital city of Fiji and
lived with the Fijian people and did what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do in Suva.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a place most tourists went.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market there had all the usual
European vegetables as well as a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of tropical stuff and we ate all that
stuff, including, we found it all tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started eating okra too, but we ate
plenty of beans and they had greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had cooked greens of various kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we ate more or less the same kind
of diet we'd always been eating and my
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth got tight in my jaw and her
fingernails got hard and her hair got
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful and we had much more energy and
we felt much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to find out what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made some inquiries and found out
that all those vegetables that we'd been
[SPEAKER_00]: eating came from the Singatoka Valley,
which was an hour and 20 minutes drive out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Suva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we rented a car for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never had a car there and we only had
one for the one day, but we rented a car
[SPEAKER_00]: for the day and drove up to the Singatoka
Valley and I rung ahead and booked myself
[SPEAKER_00]: in to have a visit with the research
station that they had up there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: valley and they showed me around and told
me how the farmers grew vegetable crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and that they never used fertilizer and
that they'd grown vegetables for 75 years
[SPEAKER_00]: in that valley, European type vegetables,
and they'd never used any fertilizer in 75
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but they did use lots of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he said the reason they had to
do that was when you grow European French
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, snap beans, you call them in the
United States in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that want to
eat them, but they were grown without
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that it worked is that the
watershed of the Singatoka River is an
[SPEAKER_00]: area of extraordinarily highly mineralized
rock of a type that's called ultra basic
[SPEAKER_00]: igneous rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically means it's just chock a
block with plant nutrients, cations with
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and magnesium and potassium and
iron and zinc and manganese and copper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just loaded with all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes soils that tend to be neutral to
slightly alkaline, which is what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: an ultra basic igneous rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that stuff comes down the Singatoka
River as silt and about every three years
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a cyclone, what they call a
cyclone there or what you call a
[SPEAKER_00]: hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Singatoka floods and it covers the
entire valley floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has a house on the valley floor
except the government research station,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is up on a mound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who farms there lives a little
bit on the slopes outside the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it deposits as silt and every
three years or so there's a large deposit
[SPEAKER_00]: of freshly ground rock dust of the most
mineralized sort you could ever want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the rainy season, it has a two
season climate, there's a dry mild season
[SPEAKER_00]: when the weather's like beautiful mild
spring day, a mild summer day in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 78 degrees and the sun is shining and
the only difference is that in the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: season there, the nights would never go
down below about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 65, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always mild, short sleeve weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gets rainy and hot and humid and
it gets so humid and so hot that all those
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable crops die of disease and the
fields get taken over by weeds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds grow mid chest high for about five
months and then it stops raining and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there and plow the weeds under and
they decompose rapidly and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the decomposition of the
organic matter also helps release minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the rock dust and they plant their
vegetable seeds and they grow beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and it tastes really good and made
us incredibly healthy despite the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide residues and I had to figure
that out because I believed in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a believer in all that rodeo
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve, let me pause you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to clarify, the soil where all the
vegetables that you were eating at your
[SPEAKER_01]: time in Fiji was grown in a particular
valley where no fertilizer was being used
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever but a variety of chemical
pesticides that did not fit with your
[SPEAKER_01]: current organic dogma or ideals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right and my belief system at that
time would have told me that those
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides were bad for me and that
there's no way I could possibly be healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm eating food with pesticide residues
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came away from there with a
different opinion which was after I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it over and you asked me about it
a few years later, I think I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: told you and a lot of audiences that I
came up with a wonderful line that I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to use when I lectured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, the problem is not that there's
residues of pesticides in our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that there's only residues
of nutrition left there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not claiming that pesticides are
necessarily good but rather that the level
[SPEAKER_01]: of mineral content in our vegetables is so
depleted because our soils are so depleted
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's affecting our nutrient levels
and our health way more than these trace
[SPEAKER_01]: elements of pesticides that may be left on
the vegetable itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the trace elements wouldn't hurt us
but the residues of the pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are an insult to our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are poisons and our bodies are
designed to deal with insults and poisons
[SPEAKER_00]: and the better nourished the body is and
the healthier the body is, the better it
[SPEAKER_00]: is at handling that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very well-nourished body would be
much less affected by pesticide residues
[SPEAKER_00]: generally speaking on an average and we're
talking statistics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not about any individual case.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to bring it back to your time in
Fiji, so you discovered this knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: then winter came and you had to head back
to Oregon at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did that guide your gardening or
your experiences moving forward after you
[SPEAKER_01]: left Fiji?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it didn't really nail home for about
a year because we came back from Fiji and
[SPEAKER_00]: we felt really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were enjoying life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were youngsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were your age or not much older.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still didn't have much sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just went back into it and Miss Bell
was an athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did triathlons and got into endurance
athletics and I got back into my business
[SPEAKER_00]: and writing and after about a year we
noticed that her fingernails were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: soft again and her hair was deteriorating
and my energy level was dropping and my
[SPEAKER_00]: positive attitude was harder to maintain
some days and my teeth were starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: worsen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, shit, you know, it's the food
we're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that trials ground that we're eating
off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been using sort of like a primitive
approach to complete organic fertilizer at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already evolved that and there was a
real ratio of wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have a ratio of calcium to
magnesium that was seven to one so I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to put in a mixture of dolomite and ag
lime to come up with about seven to one
[SPEAKER_00]: because I didn't know anything about soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, well, the best thing I can do
is put it in at seven to one and not put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing research and I mean,
if you want, I can tell you about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes I made along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I would like to maybe focus in
on then is, so you started researching
[SPEAKER_01]: this and I know from reading your book
more than one time actually that you
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on some of the work by Price and
the dental records, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also started looking into
remineralization with some of the work by
[SPEAKER_01]: William Albrecht.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you could touch on both of those
findings briefly, that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just sort of put a warning out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write this book called Growing
Vegetables Was to the Cascades and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been through seven editions and every one
of those editions except one has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete rewrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a totally different book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time it comes out with the
same title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the earlier editions have versions
of complete organic fertilizer or make
[SPEAKER_00]: assertions about the nature of the soils
or what you should do that today I would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I contradict myself from book to book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just don't want people to get stuck
if they've got an older book or believe
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I said back in 1988 or
1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was only from a very limited
partial understanding of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time before I got it all
worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that's one of the things that
I really appreciate about you as an author
[SPEAKER_01]: is that you are open minded to learning
new things and changing your mind on
[SPEAKER_01]: subjects as you become more experienced or
more educated on a particular subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of my strong points to
our weak points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the older I get, the more I
realize I'm not so damn smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell our listeners a little bit
about what you learned from Price in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weston Price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: His book, Nutrition and Physical
Degeneration, is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important book that was written
in the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you can even put Einstein in
the top 10 or any other book you come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with because, see, Price did something for
us that's absolutely priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: He documented the existence of groups of
people that no longer are the way he
[SPEAKER_00]: documented them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1930s, there still were places on
this planet that were so isolated that the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who lived there completely ate the
food that they got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't bring in any food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were poor, usually, and very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lived in hard-to-get-at places that
nobody wanted, you know, a little remote
[SPEAKER_00]: valley somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some place we had to trek in Pakistan
through passes that were frozen to nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and snow nine out of 12 months of the
year, you know, and go up so thin you
[SPEAKER_00]: could hardly walk with the danger of
slipping off the edge and dying every 300
[SPEAKER_00]: meters, you know, on a really dangerous
trail for a couple, three days of this to
[SPEAKER_00]: get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Price had heard about these places,
and he was interested in dental health
[SPEAKER_00]: from the point of view of preventative
dentistry and spent his whole life trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had failed completely as a research
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never could figure out how to prevent
people from having bad teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd see occasionally people who had bad,
really good teeth, but why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just their genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it where they grew up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it what's in their diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, the only way we're ever gonna
sort this is if we have a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe these people are a control
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I hear that these people in these
remote places have extraordinary good
[SPEAKER_00]: health and almost perfect teeth,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go and have a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he and his wife organized these
basically treks into remote places with
[SPEAKER_00]: the assistance of the local medical
authorities usually, because Price was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite well known globally as a medical,
you know, dental researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he went and visited these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did this over three years,
very extended trips by ship, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: to different continents, and then journeys
to these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went with, I don't know how many
people he went with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know the details of how he
organized these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he took a lot of photographs,
very high quality black and white
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lab with him where he didn't
analyze the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had only primitive knowledge of
nutritional aspects of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Albrecht did know how to find
out, excuse me, what Price knew how to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out was the mineral content of the
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamins were just being discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sure what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, you know, their chemical
formulation was not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the B vitamins were just sort of
lumped together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they were called B vitamins
because they were water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't know what from the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Price was able to ash the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could take a sample of food and he
could heat it up until he burned off all
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon and all he had was some ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he could use simple analytical
chemistry and say in that ash there was so
[SPEAKER_00]: much potassium, so much phosphorus,
so much calcium, so much magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he collected that data from several
dozen groups of people and took
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs of often quite old people with
all the teeth in their jaw and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: in good health and documented all kinds of
anecdotal evidence and looked at questions
[SPEAKER_00]: like are the people in this remote place
so healthy because they have special genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and not like the people down in the valley
who don't have those genes and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: they have good genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people in the valley have rotten
teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he got documentation that young
people from the remote place with perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth went down to the town to have an
adventure and stayed there for three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, ate the food down there and came
back home with a mouthful of decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'd find that many of those
people with the caries, the dental
[SPEAKER_00]: cavities actually had healed and had
scarred over with naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: enamel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was obviously scar tissue and the
body had healed those cavities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people were intaking two,
three, four times the mineral nutrition of
[SPEAKER_00]: the average American in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the quality of the food that
they were growing from a mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective was much higher and therefore
their own health which was reflected in
[SPEAKER_01]: their dental records and their dental
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was much higher as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have a lot of the tooth
decay and problems that you were seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: other areas of the world at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to say that would be that the
designer of the human body designed it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that if it was adequately nourished,
it would keep all of its teeth for its
[SPEAKER_00]: entire lifetime and they would be in
perfect condition and they would be tight
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jaw and the only thing that would
affect them would be eating a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: abrasive stuff that wore them down in
which case they also had the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace the hard coating on the outside if
you're well nourished enough which is how
[SPEAKER_00]: those cavities heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else you played sports and you got a
few teeth knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, that's the body's
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body's made to last, I don't know,
110 years, let's say, on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that if we all had perfect
nutrition for a few generations because
[SPEAKER_00]: just one generation all of a sudden
starting on perfect nutrition does not
[SPEAKER_00]: make perfect babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the nutrient density of mothers
has to increase and it takes several
[SPEAKER_00]: generations for a line of females to
develop sufficient nutritional reserves
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can then form a perfect fetus
and then nourish it with breast milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fetus would then go on to have an
average lifespan of 110 years probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, just to bring this back to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously remineralizing soils is
important from a nutrition perspective in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of our own human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you finding though in terms of
the health and growth of your plants by
[SPEAKER_01]: adding these minerals back into your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started intentionally remineralizing a
year before the intelligent garden came
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of like where I was
dealing with trace elements and really
[SPEAKER_00]: with a kind of remineralization that I'm
advocating these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ever since then, my food has tasted
better every single year, year on year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the crops, some kinds of
vegetables, the flavor improved a great
[SPEAKER_00]: deal for the first few years and then it
sort of stabilized and it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be stuff with shallow rooted crops
like lettuce because I got the topsoil
[SPEAKER_00]: remineralized first, you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trouble is how do you remineralize
the next six inches down or the next foot
[SPEAKER_00]: down because vegetables will put roots
down a lot further than most people
[SPEAKER_00]: realize if they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't encounter a lot of
nutrition down there, they don't do as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is especially true of roots and root
crops like carrots and parsnips and
[SPEAKER_00]: beetroot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crops and all the chicories,
they all feed in the subsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicories, you know, are a root crop that
just makes edible leaves in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that parsley is a root crop that makes
edible leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chicory, let me tell you what happened
with my chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to eat endive, but it has a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be bitter and it has another
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter time and the humid weather
and the cool humidity of our autumn and
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, it develops a leaf disease that
tends to cause rot spots and it can get
[SPEAKER_00]: worse and worse until it rots back to a
stump and gets so spotted with these
[SPEAKER_00]: things you don't want to eat it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll kill it eventually in a wet
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was the nature of endive,
you know, and it was hard to grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity of the winter and you put the
plants further apart and you do everything
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to increase air circulation and
it doesn't rot as quickly, but in a wet
[SPEAKER_00]: winter you're just going to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was the nature of endive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it just laughs at that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when the endive starts to try to
feed down two feet down, it's finding
[SPEAKER_00]: nourishment now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took years to leach it down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing an increase in disease
resistance, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, there's another problem
with endive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the same time that the endive
stopped having problems with the spots on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, it stopped being nearly as
bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started actually being so sweet we can
eat it like lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So improving the quality of the flavors
and odors of your given crop, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who eat with us are just gobsmacked
at how good our food tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a clue how good vegetables
can taste until they taste my vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: or how satisfying they can be and how much
less inclined we are to eat other things
[SPEAKER_00]: than vegetables because the vegetables are
just so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has had the experience of eating
conventionally grown or hydroponic tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: from a grocery store or going out to a
real farm and picking one off a vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference in the flavor is
dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you could go to that farm and walk
the rows of a variety trial and taste 30
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of tomatoes all at the
same time, you'd find there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them had a lot better flavor
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could take and put a couple of
parallel rows with the same varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: you fully remineralized one row and you
didn't with the other, the plants might
[SPEAKER_00]: not look all that different, but you would
sure notice the taste difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same variety from the two different soil
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that happens with
remineralized food, it doesn't mold after
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just let it sit out on the counter,
it doesn't grow mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sort of slowly loses moisture and
shrinks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops being quite as crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores a whole lot better if you put it
in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you touch a little bit on how a
grower or a gardener would use some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these principles in terms of adding these
minerals back into their soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that in your book you talk a lot
about soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe that process to someone
that would be new to this subject?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to back up one step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk about targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil test is just the tool that we use
to accomplish it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we want to start to talk about
what it is you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albrecht worked out the basics of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked out roughly the relationship,
the levels of calcium and magnesium and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and phosphorus that a plant
needed to produce a lot of protein and to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very healthy, such that the livestock
it ate would also be very healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't finish the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably didn't because the soil
testing procedures available at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't sophisticated enough to do soil
testing inexpensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have cost a great deal to
determine how much copper and zinc and
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese and stuff there was in the soil
or boron in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been done, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for 14 US dollars and a little bit of
postage to send 60 grams of soil to a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ohio, I can get an accurate reading of
the levels of all those elements in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are you referring to Logan Labs with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about one called Spectrum
Analytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Logan is $25 for their standard soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan's presentation, the way they give
you the information is probably a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more friendly to an amateur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, there's not a lot of
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they come up with roughly the same
kinds of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may differ, but if they differ,
it's all because all the numbers from one
[SPEAKER_00]: will be 10% higher than all the numbers
from the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in practicality, it doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really matters is the relationship
between all those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be the same from both
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took the work of a whole lot of really
smart farm advisors who sort of took
[SPEAKER_00]: Albrecht as a springboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they developed a philosophy of
fertilizing soil called base cation
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to bring the levels of the
plant nutrients up to a point and a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance that produces optimum health in
those that eat the food and at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time produces a very yield and very
healthy plants that don't have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble with insects and diseases and all
that stuff, which is all very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you don't get that kind of
result unless the land is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the process is maintaining
enough organic matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a sort of regenerative or positive
sort of agriculture where you're building
[SPEAKER_00]: real soil fertility and better health of
the entire ecosystem to produce the result
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crops that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with that approach is it does
not appeal to a greedy, selfish farmer who
[SPEAKER_00]: just wants to make the biggest bottom line
they can because the economic logic of the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer is their profit is a result of how
much they can shortcut the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more they can reduce the cost of
inputs, the more money they can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these soil tests traditionally are
focused around minimums for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: So where they're not talking about
necessarily looking at their
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations are not necessarily for
optimal plant growth or health or soil
[SPEAKER_01]: building, but rather minimums to allow for
no plant deficiencies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two philosophies here about how to
fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the economically rational
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the ethical philosophy,
you might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the economic rationalists, they just
want to make sure that there's enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plant nutrients that the crop will
produce a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enough is defined this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting any more in will not result in any
increase in yield that is anyway relates
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cost of putting more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, we put it in until the
yield peaks out and then you don't put it
[SPEAKER_00]: any more because it's not economically
rational, you're better off to use your
[SPEAKER_00]: money for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they target lower levels than somebody
who is being ethical about their food and
[SPEAKER_00]: want to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make sure there's enough
copper there that the plant isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously copper deficient and having any
gross copper deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that having 10 times that
amount of copper in the soil might do
[SPEAKER_00]: something to the total balance of
nutrition in the crop, more protective
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, more phytonutrients,
more of the stuff that the plant uses to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect itself against insect and diseases
that then when the human eats,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant helps out, protects us against
diseases and things, you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now most of our listeners are cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have a high value crop here to
where you can put more into your soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can build your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does that influence say your
recommendations or how you would treat the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil knowing that you can afford to throw
a little bit more at the crop in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals and nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well listen, you're just very lucky in
this respect that you asked me this
[SPEAKER_00]: question because there's no way that I
could talk about me growing cannabis here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Tasmania because it isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just so happens that I have a
friend who has a license to grow hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: we are growing hemp here in Tasmania now
and it's a burgeoning industry that the
[SPEAKER_00]: government is actually trying to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a certain problem with it in
that they also want to have total control
[SPEAKER_00]: over it and want to make sure that nobody
does an extraction from hemp and gets CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: or a lot of it without them calling it
medicine and having it in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, he asked me if I would do
some soil testing for him and make
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations about what to do to grow a
good hemp crop and I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some idea the kind of nutrition
hemp would need if you were thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it from the point of view of farming it,
you know, raising it by the acre and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting it like wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp needs, hemp first of all,
it makes a lot of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are growing vegetatively like
hemp, they probably need twice as much
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium as most vegetable crops and they
take a lot of it out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody were to be growing it in the
same place, they would have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're actually taking the material out
of the field, then they realize they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a lot of potassium when they take
it out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp uses a lot of manganese for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just draws a lot of manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the plant be more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses a great deal of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings up an interesting question for
me, Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's sort of a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first question is traditionally
people on these tests aim for P to equal
[SPEAKER_01]: K, phosphorus and potassium to be equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what you're suggesting with cannabis
sort of fits what some of the findings
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm having as well saying that we
want to run potassium possibly a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than we would with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other comments on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing about my experience that
may be different with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is I'm talking about growing
stuff in the soil, in the field where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got several feet of growing media
beneath your feet, a lot more root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: than you can put into a small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start putting plants in
synthetic growing media indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're dealing with a medium that
doesn't have any exchange capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in something that has no
buffering capacity, do you use that term,
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering capacity?
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be getting a little technical for
some of the listeners, but yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the soils that we manufacture here at
Kiss Organics, they range in CEC or cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look at a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have one in front of me,
but I think they're around anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: between 20 to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would like it very much if you,
off later, if you'd share with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe on another day even, what it is you
use to get that kind of exchange capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: in a synthetic medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine you use vermiculite and
charcoal and really good compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't think of anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if you can load up your exchange
capacity in your growing medium with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant nutrients that it needs,
then I'd say you'd want it to test kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way as soil that you'd want to
grow tomato plant in, with the exception
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'd want potassium up a bit higher,
and then with another exception too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not feeding the crop mostly with
soluble fertilizers, you see, if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a growing medium in a container that
has no buffering capacity, then basically
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it looks like soil, even if you've
got living compost in it, even if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an ecology living in it, if most of the
nutrition the plants are getting is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in the water that you're feeding the pot
with, then it's hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not totally sure what the proper
levels would be to try to duplicate that
[SPEAKER_00]: with dry fertilizers and the kind of stuff
we use out in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, out in the field we have another
thing, or in a pot maybe, that if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a large container with a growing medium
that has an exchange capacity over 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you could mix the nutrients into the
medium and they would then go onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange sites and sit there waiting for
the plant to draw them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a much better way of going
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant will get quite stable
nutrition that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would fertilize that stuff more or
less like I'd fertilize the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would top dress with these dry
amendments or nutrients over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant's life like you would in your
garden, is what you're suggesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd put as much of it as I could
into the soil without making it too hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and then add more on the surface as the
plant grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I know about growing cannabis,
you actually want to feed the crop quite
[SPEAKER_00]: differently depending on whether it's
flowering or whether it's vegetating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's vegetating you want to feed it
lots of nitrogen and lots of potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: a fair amount of phosphorus and all the
trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into this when we talk about
foliar feeding and all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you really want that heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the plant goes into bloom,
it's not making a lot of vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to understand that mostly
what nitrogen gets used for is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nitrogen rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the plant's constructing leaves,
then it needs a lot of nitrogen and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves are nice dark green and they
have a lot of active chlorophyll in them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they make a lot of sugar and they do a
good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant starts to bloom,
it stops making leaves and starts making
[SPEAKER_00]: flower mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mass doesn't have very much
chlorophyll in it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis growers try to breed the leaves
out of these flower structures as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible because they're less harsh when
you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't they talk about a ratio of like
calyx to leaves and that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want lots and lots of stigmas and
lots and lots of seed bracts, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: little in the way of leafy structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I wrong, Ted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, essentially they want the most
valuable part of the crop in most cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want trichome density.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we're looking at that plant
growth, bud formation and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there are certain nutrients that are
tied to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition to just these macro or
major nutrients that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, sulfur, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I think that you have really
promoted is adding in all these trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by getting these rock dusts into the
soil, we're going to increase the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, the trichome density, the quality
of the final crop, while also increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: the overall health and yield of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Ted, there's something that you
could do that wouldn't be free for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it, but you could answer a really major
question for me because you are using rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had a lot of reservations
around rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I lived in Oregon, there was a quarry
into the old Cascades Basalt, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: located right along Interstate 5 between
Cottage Grove and Cresswell, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see it when you went up the
highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mined basalt for a road base and
things like that, crushed rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could get dust if you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just go there with buckets and
at the base of the conveyor belt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rock dust just piled up as deep as you
wanted to shovel it up and take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just as happy to see you do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried it and used a whole lot of it
and didn't seem to do a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to make much difference
that I could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got an analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has in it all the trace
elements that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you analyze the parts per million
and then think about how much you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually spreading, and if I'm spreading a
ton of rock dust, and it's three parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million zinc, well, in a ton, what is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a million grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I think a ton is something like a
million grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's three parts per million,
it means that in a ton of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got three grams of elemental zinc,
you see, in a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I spread zinc sulfate,
I want to spread like seven pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: elemental zinc on an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes out as zinc sulfate,
and it goes into the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it attaches itself onto the
cation exchange capacity if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately picked up by a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sits there as available zinc to
feed the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put seven pounds of available zinc
basically into that field, into the furrow
[SPEAKER_00]: slice, into the top six inches of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I put out a ton of rock dust,
I'm putting on, say, three pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially available zinc some day when
the stuff completes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It completely breaks down whenever that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much unavailable zinc would I have
to put out to actually make seven pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of zinc available on the exchange sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to ask that question,
it starts to look like we're talking 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30, 40 tons of the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can give a little bit of input
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I want to distinguish before
we go too much further is that when we put
[SPEAKER_01]: out rock dust or we add alfalfa into our
soil, we're not directly feeding our
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but rather feeding these microbes
that are in the soil that are cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: these nutrients into a form that the plant
can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another important aspect of gardening
and growing and farming is the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: populations that we have in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where high quality compost
becomes really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you were going to say that,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also the party line of the rock
dust people who are pushing rock dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it's a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always had my doubts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm from Missouri, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm saying, Ted, is you could show
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a way you could show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is have some tissue
testing done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some of the nice leaves from some of
your cannabis that you've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with this rock dust in the medium and send
them off to a lab that does leaf analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and find out if the levels of copper and
zinc and manganese and boron in the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are what you'd want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, here in Washington,
there is no tissue testing, as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of, that's legal for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe maybe in Oregon it's possible,
but that's not something we can do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't send the leaves to Oregon,
can you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely can't mail anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just not maybe possible to really
answer this question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to give you a little more information,
when we mix our soils, we're putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: around 100 pounds of minerals and
nutrients per yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very high level of amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That soil is going to actually heat up and
thermally compost for at least two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're turning it and keeping it
evenly moist before it'll even cool down
[SPEAKER_01]: to where we could plant into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're putting in very, very high levels
of a lot of these nutrients in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this container, so if you put a
plant in 50 liters of this material,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a nice big pot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a 12-inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you put it into a 14-inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something with a good volume of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there enough nutrients in there that
you can grow a plant from one end to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other on just nothing but water?
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a seven-gallon container is
probably the minimum, and that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: vary based on how long you're vegging your
plant before you flip it into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are finding that, yes, you can go
the full cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in a smaller container like a
seven-gallon, we have a nutrient pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is essentially the dry amendment
that we put into our original soil mix
[SPEAKER_01]: that we will top dress the pot and scratch
into the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the first and the end of the
third week of flour, just a half cup to a
[SPEAKER_01]: cup per plant as a way to help it get
those nutrients by the time it's ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're finding is growers that are
doing raised beds indoors or giving the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant more soil, as we discussed,
are able to grow larger, healthier crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one thing you may not be aware of
is that in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally, what's happening is a
grower is bringing soil into an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's basement, maybe it's a garage,
maybe it's an actual warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that soil is, well, soil or
perlite, whatever their media is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, is then fed with either bottled
nutrients that are organic or ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are ionic salts or conventional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the cycle,
that soil that's typically grown
[SPEAKER_01]: conventionally with excessive nitrates and
excessive phosphates is then put outside
[SPEAKER_01]: and disposed of, because the salt levels
are way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not without substantial leaching,
I imagine, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that soil that's primarily,
let's say, cocoa-based or just
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite-based is then dumped out and
leaching into our groundwater,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a whole other problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're having to buy and bring
in new soil, new bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And start over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what myself and others have been
working on is essentially creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil indoors over time by
reamending these larger containers every
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to move the soil in and
out of the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some growers that have been
using the same soil up to five years now
[SPEAKER_01]: by just adding back organic matter and
adding nutrients back, similar as you
[SPEAKER_01]: would find in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did some soil testing on these
containers, so at the end of every crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and got an idea of what was there already,
you could then use sort of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent gardener approach and figure
out what you needed to put in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them back into balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, though we do find that the
intelligent gardener one doesn't allow for
[SPEAKER_01]: that higher potassium and a few other
things that seem to be more specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do have lab tests or soil tests
with Logan that show how these levels are
[SPEAKER_01]: varying every crop cycle based on the
nutrients that we're putting in at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning and at the beginning of the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see more or less what the plant
is taking out of the soil over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can, I think, start to address your
rock dust question in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clear that up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because being an organic gardener,
I can't, I don't feel comfortable adding a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like zinc sulfates or copper
sulfates, I can't, I don't think I can add
[SPEAKER_01]: them into my soils according to NLP
standards because they're not considered
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know a good organic form
of manganese, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is NLP?
[SPEAKER_01]: The National Organic Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: NLP, I misunderstood, misheard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Australia, organic certification
agencies will allow the grower to use
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate salts with trace elements if a
soil analyst has determined by soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: that these things are deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same law here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as someone who is making soils from
container media, it's not something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get into adding into my soil
initially because of the fact it isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: considered completely organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know of other sources for some of
these?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know kelp meal is one that you talk a
lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you feel about using chelated
trace elements?
[SPEAKER_00]: That instead of being copper sulfate,
we're copper gluconate.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who use them say that you don't
need to use much more than about half as
[SPEAKER_00]: much to have the same result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the biomin copper that you're
referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's sort of biomin trace
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't looked into that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it is OMRI certified though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might feel okay, you and your
client base might feel okay about using
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it would be acceptable theoretically,
I think you should experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know of a good source for manganese
besides manganese sulfate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not unless there's a biomin form of
manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another difficulty that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, where I live, I'm way out at the end
of a long supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australia is way out at the end of a
long supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you people in North America have a lot
more materials and possibilities available
[SPEAKER_00]: to you than we do down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, I don't have any choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to add manganese, I need
manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to sort of summarize what we've
been talking about a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a grower to test his soil or test his
container growing media, find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: those levels are based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can then go back and amend their
soils properly to bring any levels that
[SPEAKER_01]: are low or bring everything into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop you here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going backwards a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use the levels that are
recommended in the intelligent gardener to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis with the exception of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could still use the targets that
the intelligent gardener generates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see, for all the other elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that you probably want at least
twice as much potassium as the intelligent
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener calls for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding the same thing with our
trials as well here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the amounts of nitrogen if you
think about cannabis as a high demand crop
[SPEAKER_00]: during the time that it's in vegetative
growth and then as a very low demand crop
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's blooming and make sure that
during all of that time you see because
[SPEAKER_00]: low demand crops don't demand lower levels
of trace elements or calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just really mean lower levels of
nitrogen because they're not making
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still building a lot of mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're getting at is essentially
that because cannabis is an annual plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: an annual crop, it's going to naturally
want to senesce or complete its life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the process of forming
buds or flowers is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that process, it doesn't need
as much nitrogen because it's not trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to put on any vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it might need a third as much
nitrogen or even a quarter as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen as it needed while it was growing
new leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on that subject, one thing that Jeff
Lowenfels talks about in his book Teaming
[SPEAKER_01]: with Microbes is that the plant is really
in control of this process based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting out into the soil to control
sort of the nutrient cycling and microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on there in the area around
the roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any thoughts or comments on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a sort of gut level feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you take this the right way,
Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, people who want to believe in
organics, and I say want to believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, then they adjust things so that
they make a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good narrative.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think you're hearing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some truth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been learning all kinds of things
about how plants talk to the microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: their root zone, get a collaborative
relationship going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even mind talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite exciting information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been finding out how to wind my
plants up another 25 or 30% more than they
[SPEAKER_00]: ever were before by foliar feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same kind of elements that we've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've discovered that plants cannot obtain
all the nutrients that they could use if
[SPEAKER_00]: they could but get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what you put into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how concentrated the
soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant could use more of certain things
at certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets them, there's a dramatic
improvement in the way that plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you do that is with foliar
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds really interesting,
Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do another segment talking
more about that now that the growers have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of foundation into your
philosophies and why this process is
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be wonderful to have you
back on to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go there another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could write another book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You younger people are going to work this
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 74 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy to get up now and feel good
today and go out there and grow a few
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am not out to try to learn the
whole thing as much as I've already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of content at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of loose ends have we leaving
dangling?
[SPEAKER_00]: We must have not finished all kinds of
things in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we covered a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to follow up with you in
another talk to talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: about the connection between microbes and
the soil food web and this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: remineralization and how those two camps
have been butting heads in terms of their
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophies for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would love to talk to you again
about this foliar feeding idea and what
[SPEAKER_01]: your findings are with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see a Logan Labs report on
some of these deep soil beds that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been running for five years and see what
Logan says they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you a bunch of tests on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll find it really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would enjoy seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk to you about that.
