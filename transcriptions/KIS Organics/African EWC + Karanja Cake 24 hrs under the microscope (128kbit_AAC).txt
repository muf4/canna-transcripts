[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I think makes microscope work
so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the Karanja cake now,
added to the exact same compost as before
[SPEAKER_00]: that we added the neem to, I wasn't able
to find any fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we zoom in here, now this is 400
times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we have some bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing near what appears to be the
levels that we had with the neem cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly more than the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one had a very different
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water actually turned a grayish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of murky looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see some guys cruising around
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to see how this will look in
another 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go check it out.
Let's go.
