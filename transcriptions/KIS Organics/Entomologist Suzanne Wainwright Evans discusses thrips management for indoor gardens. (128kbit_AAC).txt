[SPEAKER_01]: For what you were dealing with,
I'm gonna guess without seeing it was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onion thrips biology is very similar to
Western flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adult flies in female, she inserts her
egg into the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in there a couple of days,
it hatches out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cruising around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have asymmetrical mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of more, I don't even use the
word brass, but they kind of like damage
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell surface there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you get that white
silverish color.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of colored to them because
they're removing the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look there through when they're
in their early in stars, basically
[SPEAKER_01]: toddlers and even teenagers, they're
they're kind of yellowish clear,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can see the green chlorophyll from
the plant in their in their gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they poop it out this kind
of greenish color from the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're going to cruise around and
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always hate to say things
because people take it like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: my God, that's it's black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, onion thrips tend to feed
more on foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they can feed on foliage,
but generally they are more of a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: problem because they really like pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Western flower thrips are what we
see a lot in pansies and we see them in
[SPEAKER_01]: petunias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see, you know, in lilies because
they have a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onion thrips tend to be more foliage
feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're growing cannabis,
guess what you don't have present?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I think people because they they
don't do their due diligence and take the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to ID, which I don't expect growers
to be able to sell species that thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's extensions jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people that that can do that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people guess and they do the matching
photos online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you cannot just match photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of Western flower thrips and onion thrips
necessarily for ID from a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at the length of the hair
on the protenotums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to count and tenal segments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but but the good thing is
generally for onion thrips and Western
[SPEAKER_01]: flower thrips, the management is basically
the same because the biology is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're they're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're eating on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they drop to the soil to pupate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the adults emerge back up where
it gets sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is when you're dealing things with like a
kind of thrips who do not drop to the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to pupate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a much larger thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: The predatory mites can't take out a kind
of thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you generally have to spray for a kind
of thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to onion and Western flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bios work really well, the predatory
mites and all of that, when it gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, Western flower thrips have more
resistance issues than onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not something cannabis people
necessarily have to worry about,
[SPEAKER_01]: because those kinds of pesticides,
you're not going to be using anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about the SF nematode
Swirsky approach following up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a couple of days after a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you critique my yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Suffolk is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Suffolk is dry, you can release a
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to do like,
you know, two or three sprays of Suffolk
[SPEAKER_01]: likes two to three days apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's smart to wait to release the
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from an economic standpoint,
I generally go with Cucumeris more because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a lot less expensive and it works
just as well in cannabis on the thrips as
[SPEAKER_01]: Swirsky does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swirsky tends to be, you know,
a little more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but no, I think that's that's a
perfectly fine program and using,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your sticky cards, you know,
to monitor, I think is a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, good, good tool for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'll give you, I'll give you
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing you mentioned was how they
eat the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the ways I just scouting for
thrips, when you see that, like I always
[SPEAKER_00]: called it like the shiny leaf surface is
how I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just has a different gloss to the
leaf where the damage is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that unique to thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, thrips damage looks very
specific compared to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I look for is that
shininess where the damages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lace bugs can give you that kind of look
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, lace bugs aren't a big problem in
cannabis, but it has lace bugs have been
[SPEAKER_01]: reported in cannabis, but it's not a huge
economic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to ever say always,
but generally also, you know, spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: damage sometimes can look a little
similar, but they don't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: silveriness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't always see that silveriness
with thrips damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do see it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
