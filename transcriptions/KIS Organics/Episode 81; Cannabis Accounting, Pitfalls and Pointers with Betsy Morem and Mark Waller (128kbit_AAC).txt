[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast will be a bit
different than my usual topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, there's more to
cultivation than just what happens in our
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we like it or not, taxes and
proper accounting are crucial to keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: our businesses afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down with two CPAs, Betsy Morum and
Mark Waller, who have founded an
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting firm specializing in working
with folks in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My upcoming podcasts include another visit
with Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as the Bug Lady, to talk about
what she has learned and encountered since
[SPEAKER_00]: last being on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also had a wonderful conversation
with Dr. Abby Wick, who is an assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: professor at North Dakota State University
and is an Extension Soil Health
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her knowledge of infield soil health
practices and cover crops was really
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be putting that podcast out here
soon, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I heard about you guys because I
heard Mark talking on Clubhouse about a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular form that we'll talk about here
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But accounting is something that is not
something that we normally talk about when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to cover this because I think
it's something that we all have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the reality of growing in a
legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to have you guys on to
talk a little bit about what you do and
[SPEAKER_00]: how accounting fits in and the finances
fit in for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys give me a little bit of your
background and talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so my name is Mark Waller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a CPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I co-founded Morum and Waller CPAs with
Betsy Morum, who's with us here today,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our biggest thing that we do is really
provide world class accounting services
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis businesses for month end
annual compliance all the way down to your
[SPEAKER_02]: your audits that you have to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really try to use kind of a data
driven tech forward approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that's unique about
cannabis with regard to other businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: is that cannabis businesses don't have as
many tools in the toolbox that most
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very stringent on what they're
even allowed to do at all with banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is there are many regulations for
banks that say you can't work with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis due to it being a federally
illegal substance on schedule one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal government's schedule of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, there are there are
some banks that do work with with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are not very many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the ones that do work with
cannabis businesses are fairly well
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost it's it's almost like
searching for something that to aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: quite sure to find that normally any
business can go down to the corner and and
[SPEAKER_02]: find a bank and most banks are happy to
pick up new businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's much trickier for for cannabis
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really try to be kind of a partner
with cannabis businesses, knowing knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: what we know about partnering with other
banks, making sure that they have banking
[SPEAKER_02]: services and then providing end to end
accounting services so that all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different things that become very complex,
especially for cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: we try to we try to cut down that that red
tape as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Betsy, do you need a little bit of
your quick background here and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: dive in with some I've got some questions
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Betsy Morem and I'm a CPA as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Co-founder of Morgan Waller CPAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into I became interested in the
cannabis space a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but but didn't really get into the
accounting side of things until last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have been providing accounting
services for small businesses since about
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that experience of working
with startups and small businesses from
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground up has really helped me with
cannabis clients, because a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: clients are starting from from ground
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I'm really excited to be
joining forces with Mark and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: providing world class services to cannabis
clients across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess, you know, for me,
I guess my first question would be what
[SPEAKER_00]: are some of the things as someone who is
setting up a facility or a grow a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in a state, what are some of the
things that you guys are seeing as
[SPEAKER_00]: potential pitfalls or roadblocks that
people should be aware of?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think right away, it's the challenge
of just finding a bank is it hits you
[SPEAKER_02]: right in the face when you when you first
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we work with some some startup farms
and some of them are lucky enough to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to us with a banking relationship in
existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our other clients are coming
to us and saying, you know, we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: license, we're ready to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought some land, but we don't have a
banking relationship yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis are not not having a banking
relationship really puts you at a
[SPEAKER_02]: disadvantage right away for account for
accounting, because once once if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have a banking relationship and you're
tracking things either through your
[SPEAKER_02]: individual your individual accounts,
sometimes maybe you have cash that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with, but it makes just the day to
day record keeping much hairier than it
[SPEAKER_02]: really needs to be, which is unfortunate
because so many of our clients that we
[SPEAKER_02]: work with want to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to they want to be upfront with
their record keeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to keep things really organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really puts them at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been I've been tracking
federal federal banking bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I think there's one in the the
federal government right now that has some
[SPEAKER_02]: promise of happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's there's no
guarantee that it's going to happen this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so for the time being, growers that are
starting a new farm just get faced with
[SPEAKER_02]: with that reality right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even that's not even getting
into some of the other things that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growers have to think about,
like Section 280E handling cash,
[SPEAKER_02]: handling internal control for cash,
IRS audits, you know, banks requesting
[SPEAKER_02]: information, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just getting off the ground is hard
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, Mark, along those lines,
if you were, say, a grower coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal market and you may have been on the
medical side and working strictly in cash,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you may or may not have been
paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may or may not have claimed all of
this cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to be able to show where all
the cash came from before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to set up a banking
relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if so, you know, how does that
work from an IRS perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, when establishing a
business primarily from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a business that's been run by cash for
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so one thing that that kind of goes
unnoticed is that there is an IRS firm
[SPEAKER_02]: called Form 8300 that any business that is
handling large transactions of cash over
[SPEAKER_02]: ten thousand dollars is required to fill
out a Form 8300 every time they have those
[SPEAKER_02]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just the administrative burden that
alone is is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sort of having a strong banking
relationship in place, growers really have
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about compliance right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not many, many small businesses
are set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The IRS, I should say, is geared toward
helping small businesses get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for cannabis businesses, they the IRS
does what they can, but but they are faced
[SPEAKER_02]: with something that's that's really just
kind of a it's a beast right from the get
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to talk a little bit more
about Form 8300, but I guess my question
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, if let's just say I had a
few hundred thousand dollars in cash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to start a legal cannabis business,
how from an accounting perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that more of a legal question in
terms of I assume you need to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: money into a bank and set up a banking
relationship to where you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for things so that you have
audit trail that the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, if if there
isn't a banking relationship there yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't mean that we can't do our
accounting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means that how we do our
accounting is going to be a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have within our firm, we have kind
of all the work papers that we need to to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of handle any type of situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so certainly there are our businesses
that have started that that don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: banking relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have an attorney that they've
hired and are tracking a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: things from how they're creating their
entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of a lot of new
cultivators who are looking for investors,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, might be looking to be
founded as an as a C Corp, which in many
[SPEAKER_02]: respects is is more beneficial to new
businesses that are looking for investor
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be already some of these
professional relationships set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what our job is as as their their
accountants is to track any of those those
[SPEAKER_02]: contributions to the new entity,
any expenditures out of the new entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we try to do is kind of tailor our
accounting software in a way so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can kind of track any any owner
contributions or any owner distributions,
[SPEAKER_02]: legal invoices, any any of those types of
things that that come into play,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially from from a startup free
revenue standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is really important to capture all
of those things accurately, because
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of what you have going on,
once you start that entity, the clock is
[SPEAKER_02]: ticking on filing your annual reports with
the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly with the way IRS is is going
right now, there's there's a federal
[SPEAKER_02]: movement to beef up the the budget of the
IRS to increase tax compliance and
[SPEAKER_02]: collection on tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would I would be very surprised if there
wasn't also an increased compliance effort
[SPEAKER_02]: made by the IRS, especially toward
cannabis businesses that because of
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 280E potentially can earn more tax
revenue and that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is this is just me opinion
opinionating here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think when we're talking big
picture about Section 280E, certainly as
[SPEAKER_02]: as legalization becomes a bigger topic
federally, 280E is a big piece that
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously a lot of people want to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the elephant in the room is if that
goes away, where does the revenue come
[SPEAKER_02]: from?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there there's certainly a delicate
dance being done, I think, in the in the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal government with respect to that,
that it would be great to legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of things that need to
be sorted out before that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, do you have any recommendations for a
new facility in terms of potential banks
[SPEAKER_00]: to look into that you've worked with or
also accounting software that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we use QuickBooks online right
now, but I've used a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting software.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my end, what do you find most popular
for for both of those options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer that question, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in general, those that are
looking for banking, I would I would look
[SPEAKER_01]: to your local credit unions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've with with our clients, we've found
that they're able to establish banking
[SPEAKER_01]: relations, relationships with more credit
unions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I encourage you in general think
that credit unions are great to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, in terms of the accounting
software, Mark and I, we use two different
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly two different systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: QuickBooks online tab, which you said is
what you use and then zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some people have run into
issues with QuickBooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some campus clients have run into issues
with QuickBooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are sort of guiding most of our new
clients in the direction of zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in general, what's great
about both systems is that they're both
[SPEAKER_01]: web based, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives cultivators better access to
their books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being that they could just log on to the
web at any point and and take a look
[SPEAKER_01]: around so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may add to that a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like Betsy, like you were saying,
the web based tools are really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that that makes working with
businesses, not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all businesses right now really
interesting from an accounting standpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: is is because all of these tools are
online and so many of them are built to
[SPEAKER_02]: work together and interact with each other
and having an online platform for your
[SPEAKER_02]: base accounting system like QuickBooks or
zero gives you a big advantage going
[SPEAKER_02]: forward because as more tools,
especially in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: get developed, all of those tools are
being developed in a way that makes it so
[SPEAKER_02]: that it interacts with your accounting
software.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would I would advise I'm I'm
personally not for or against any of any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the different accounting systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they all have have pluses and
minuses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would definitely advise if you're
thinking about going online versus going
[SPEAKER_02]: desktop, I would definitely advise going
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the cloud based systems are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually done a lot of research on
this from my company because we were using
[SPEAKER_00]: QuickBooks desktop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say is switching financial
software is really challenging from a
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative perspective year over year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you pick one, it's really great to
stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's actually spelled Xero for
people who want to look that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it didn't work because here in
Washington, the state, if I ship something
[SPEAKER_00]: to Eastern Washington, I have to pay sales
tax based off of that location,
[SPEAKER_00]: not off of my location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these for some reason zero
just didn't offer that functionality at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ended up going with QuickBooks
online just strictly for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, looking at what other
software integrates in is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important, too, because, you know,
I've had to have, you know, apps and other
[SPEAKER_00]: software allow me to connect my Shopify
site with, you know, QuickBooks desktop
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's less of an issue for a
cultivator, I think, as it is for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the retail side like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, definitely look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros and cons are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of credit unions,
yeah, I've had the same issue that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bank, basically, you know, they told me
not to answer that I work in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry because technically I'm not
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they felt OK about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you say yes, you do, which you have
to legally if you are growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really limits your ability to to do a
lot of banking stuff or work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been denied loans just because
they, you know, Google my name,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and decided that I was,
you know, I fell into that into that
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as far as specific banks to work
with, if a new client comes to us and
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a banking relationship
established and they're in another state
[SPEAKER_01]: that perhaps we're less familiar with,
we have contacts within our network who
[SPEAKER_01]: can offer up suggestions of credit unions
within that state, that state that that
[SPEAKER_01]: work with cannabis clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk a little bit more about
Section 280E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at the definition for people
who aren't familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a section of the IRS code that
forbids businesses from deducting
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise ordinary business expenses from
gross income associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficking of schedule one or two
substances, which is where cannabis falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of explain that in more,
you know, more common language as to
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what that means for a cultivator?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Section 280E, your definition that you
read is is is spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that makes it tricky for
cannabis growers is really twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the the record keeping that's
required to kind of have your ducks in a
[SPEAKER_02]: row with respect to ensuring that you
would be able to make it through an audit
[SPEAKER_02]: of the IRS are very tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and the reason for that is is just
like you said, is there are a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different expenses that for a quote
unquote regular business would be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: be deducted?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically kind of anything outside
of the realm of the actual production of
[SPEAKER_02]: your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rent expense, you know, utilities,
you know, meals and entertainment,
[SPEAKER_02]: travel, things like that that are a normal
course of business type of expenses are
[SPEAKER_02]: generally not allowable to be deducted for
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until until until the federal law
changes to move cannabis off of schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: one, that is going to be the law of the
land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that really means is you're
paying more in taxes and obviously nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to pay more in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, you run a big risk by
trying to push the envelope too much with
[SPEAKER_02]: regard to what types of deductions you
take on your tax return.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been a number of oh,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so just to clarify, you know,
if you're working with a CPA that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of this and say does take these as
business expenses, you talked about meals,
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment, you know, some of these
other things like utilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get audited, you will have to pay
these taxes plus potentially penalties or
[SPEAKER_00]: back taxes on absolutely on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the long run, it could end up
costing you quite a bit if you don't claim
[SPEAKER_00]: this up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially, you know, like I was
saying earlier, there there's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be an increased presence on
cannabis as more and more states become
[SPEAKER_02]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is just kind of this this this
unfortunately, not many, many CPAs will
[SPEAKER_02]: touch cannabis because of all the reasons
that we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a shortage of good CPAs
that will help growers navigate through
[SPEAKER_02]: these kind of tricky, tricky situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, along these lines,
the one that I see a lot on my end as
[SPEAKER_00]: being someone who provides soil and
nutrients and those sorts of things is
[SPEAKER_00]: some growers that we work with will give
us a resale certificate or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural exemption either in the name
of the business or in Shell Corporation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the business that owns that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 50 50 here in the state in
terms of people who pay the sales tax that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growers and those that that hand me a
certificate and essentially by giving me
[SPEAKER_00]: this resale certificate, it's passing the
buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get audited, what's going to
happen is they're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, why didn't you collect, you know,
sales tax from this grower, this company?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say, well, they gave me this
resale certificate and it kind of passes
[SPEAKER_00]: the buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll follow up potentially with
that company and say, hey, why are you
[SPEAKER_00]: charging the sales tax on your end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that work with cannabis is my
question, because I know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with farmers and other non-cannabis
companies, this isn't really an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't I don't know with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I would be really cautious about not
doing as much as you can to stay in
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance as a cannabis business,
just because as cannabis becomes legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still all of these different
issues that cannabis businesses are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, if if it turns
federally legal, there's still likely
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be, you know, vocal opposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, certainly you'll see even in
states where cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are often groups of local
municipalities, sometimes it depends on
[SPEAKER_02]: what the state law is written like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But occasionally there can be
municipalities that say the state law says
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis is legal, but we don't want
cannabis in this town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is there's I would always
advise any of our clients to be overly,
[SPEAKER_02]: overly compliant more than than try to
push the envelope, just because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a huge target on on their on
their backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do realize my question is is a state
tax question versus a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: national or federal tax, which is what the
two eighty refers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here in Washington, for example,
if I'm if I'm making a product and I use
[SPEAKER_00]: these inputs to go into my product,
I don't have to pay sales tax on those
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs because I'm going to be charging
sales tax to the final user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not being taxed twice for the same
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I maybe that's a state specific
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's something you've
come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's going to it's going to
vary state by state, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that's going to be
something every state is going to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with, maybe slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, what's going to be most
important is that you are doing what you
[SPEAKER_02]: are supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: To pay pay what tax that you need to
obviously try not trying to overpay tax by
[SPEAKER_02]: any by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but doing everything that you can all
the way down to something something like
[SPEAKER_02]: an exemption certificate, sales tax
exemption forms that you may have to fill
[SPEAKER_02]: out for your states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just doing all of that as as above above
book as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you worked with any campus companies
that have been audited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and seen anything there that were
things to watch for, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't we haven't worked specifically
with them, but we've definitely as as part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the national network of CPAs that we're
involved in, we have have seen other
[SPEAKER_02]: accountants in our network that have had
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's there's been a
number of different court cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: some that have gone all the way to the
Supreme Court that a lot of us are
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking really closely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most recently, the the case regarding
Harborside, which is a cannabis business
[SPEAKER_02]: in California, went all the way to the
Supreme Court and they still ruled in
[SPEAKER_02]: favor of maintaining Section 280 E.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is there is still quite a bit of
work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, you know, the IRS hasn't
gotten to a point yet where a point where
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've seen in other industries in my
prior experience in public accounting,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, in the mid 2000s,
the IRS audited many credit unions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a result of finding parts of
their business to be not not really part
[SPEAKER_02]: of their exempt mission, which resulted in
a lot of credit unions and businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: paying more tax than they needed to or
that more tax than they had expected to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really was a result of what the
IRS I think is doing right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of gearing up their
budgeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, you know, cannabis could be
a target for increased audits like that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know for certain that that's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the IRS is not going to come
out and say, hey, we're going to audit
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's certainly certainly would make a
lot of sense that that would be coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being especially with the complexity
of the accounting, it just it feels like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, cannabis, the cannabis industry
would be sort of an easy target for
[SPEAKER_01]: additional revenue for the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, too, I've actually been
on conference calls with with the IRS who
[SPEAKER_02]: section that would be dealing with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of people have kind
of a bad feeling about the IRS that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're the big bad guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you actually work with the people
that are in charge of these, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: they want you to stay compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they they really like working
with CPAs like our firm because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily the subject matter experts
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to make sure the way that
they approach things is doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they look to see what's going on
in the industry as much as we look to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I and maybe this is just me having
having worked with with the IRS for many
[SPEAKER_02]: years on many different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them as the big bad,
scary wolf in the corner necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do want to make sure that you're
doing what's right and and following what
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have actually over the past year,
they have released more information about
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana related businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if you Google IRS marijuana,
they put out a really nice Web page
[SPEAKER_02]: probably six months ago that that starts
to talk about some of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just say they're not they're
not scary necessarily if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: things right, but that you want to do
things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I've had a kind of a
roller coaster relationship with the IRS
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got audited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, before we were ever even doing
business in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady who came out and did our
audit was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, it's it's a ton of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're trying to do things by
the book, it's really easy to screw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unrelated to that audit, I got a letter in
the mail was probably like 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: now from the IRS saying I owed fifteen
thousand dollars in back taxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what happened was I had,
you know, when I was setting up my
[SPEAKER_00]: business PayPal account, I had put in my
Social Security number instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: business UBI number because it had a spot
for my first Social Security number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the laws changed around the
accounting for, you know, companies like
[SPEAKER_00]: PayPal right around that time,
they came after me for claiming I hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: paid taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I paid taxes on it through the
business because it was business income.
[SPEAKER_00]: That money didn't not go directly to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to the business, which was owned
by my parents at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had accounted for it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting this corrected with the IRS,
I probably had 60 hours on the phone with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, at least just on hold and then
talking to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're like, hey,
you need to go into the local IRS office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I have to go and make an
appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady there, like she legitimately
laughed at me and she's like, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely cannot help you with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go you need to go back and
talk to them on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a nightmare the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got this fifteen thousand
dollar bill that's accruing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I ended up paying my CPA at
the time over two thousand dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially just write a stupid letter
saying that we'd accounted for it another
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it took me about two months
of trying to get this figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, you know, having to pay
that much money to my CPA, who I think
[SPEAKER_00]: overcharged me quite a bit, it just it's
not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a simple mistake I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I saw a spot for Social Security
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in and I shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have used my federal tax ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the little stuff like that
that can get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the the the value that
we bring to clients is making sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're audit ready at any given point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, that helps them sleep at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's kind of priceless to the
to the business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say that's sort of how I
heard about you is because I was listening
[SPEAKER_00]: on Clubhouse and heard Mark talking about
form eighty three hundred, which was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the reasons the main reason I want to
get you guys on the podcast, because I had
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of form eighty three hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't we start there and then
I'll share a little bit of my backstory on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you describe what that form is and
how it relates to our industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so so basically any any cash payment
that is over ten thousand dollars must
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody who receives that type of payment
should file a form eighty three hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: with the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, for cannabis businesses that
don't have a cash, a bank relationship or
[SPEAKER_02]: do a lot of work in cash, that requires
quite a bit of extra paperwork that that
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be kind of earmarked by form eighty
three hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are penalties for not filing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those eighty three hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about potential audits
that could be targeted toward cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, certainly that's going to be
one of the IRS's tools in their toolbox of
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, did you do you have cash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, a lot of the businesses
businesses will say yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you file all your form eighty
three hundreds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely, there's going to be a lot of
businesses that have not done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just going to be low hanging
fruit for for audits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so when I heard Mark talking about
this, it kind of surprised me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: had heard something around this ten
thousand dollar mark and I've taken a few
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions like that and I thought the
bank was filing them on my behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I ever deposit more than ten
thousand dollars, they would fill out a
[SPEAKER_00]: form and send it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm doing everything legal,
I figured that was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned was the bank doesn't send
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an internal process over and I
can't remember the number of my bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been five thousand or eight
thousand where they make a notation on my
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not sending anything off to
the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's my responsibility to fill out
this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I learned was that all
transactions that are considered related
[SPEAKER_00]: and exceed that ten thousand as a whole
must be reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter how many transactions
a deal is broken into or how long within a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 month period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you space it out, if the IRS considers
them related, you can be penalized for
[SPEAKER_00]: failing to file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some nuances with it that go
along with it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who tries to follow the
rules and as someone who tries to be
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant, this was something that I had
dropped the ball on strictly out of
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's that's going to be the case
for a lot of a lot of businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's also not a very widely,
widely circulated piece of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the IRS, you know, I talk about
their website, their website is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: very good and it does have very good
resources about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is fairly clear when you read into
the the form 8300 reference guide on the
[SPEAKER_02]: on the IRS website, what is required and
and what you know, what you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: facing if you don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you scroll all the way to
the penalty section and it goes right into
[SPEAKER_02]: civil penalties for negligent failure to
file can be up to, you know, starting with
[SPEAKER_02]: one hundred dollars not to exceed not to
exceed one point five million per calendar
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they absolutely do not mess around with
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the purpose of form 8300 is a
good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the real purpose is to provide an
audit trail for to to avoid anti-money
[SPEAKER_02]: laundering and basically to enforce anti
money laundering efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a paper trail with the IRS,
certainly it covers you if you are dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of cash transactions and they
are all for legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly you want to have yourself
covered as well as a business owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, yeah, I would want to be aware,
too, if someone else, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm paying with a cash transaction that
they're going to be listing this down
[SPEAKER_00]: because you actually put the identity of
whom the cash was received from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can select if you think it's a
suspicious transaction, if you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: all the information that you need from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a fairly extensive report and you
have 15 days from the time of receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: the money to get this filed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to know, like I now that we
know about it, we're absolutely doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have to talk to growers and say,
hey, you know, if you want to pay me cash,
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware that this is a form that I have
to fill out legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're aware that their name's
going down in this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other thing, too, to be aware of
is, you know, whether they deposit that
[SPEAKER_00]: cash directly into the bank account,
you know, or they, you know, send a
[SPEAKER_00]: cashier's check or a money order.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are considered cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only just be aware of that,
that that you don't get around it by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doing money orders and thousand
dollar increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still expected to fill out this
form or someone's expected to fill out
[SPEAKER_00]: this form if you pay in that manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was the biggest thing I
wanted to cover in this podcast because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was totally new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for allowing us to get that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there is there anything else in terms
of, you know, potential things to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: for or even things, you know, warning
signs maybe that maybe your CPA is enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to speed on your industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that like I'm thinking
as a grower, what can I look for to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of improve my accounting process?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can start with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talk a lot about cannabis
specific things such as Section 280E,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, increased compliance efforts
that are required for banks for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always come back to the accounting
101.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are your accounts reconciled?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter if you're a cannabis
business or you're a flower shop in town
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your accounts are not reconciled,
if your inventory is not reconciled,
[SPEAKER_02]: if your cash is not reconciled,
those are also low hanging fruit for for
[SPEAKER_02]: the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for auditors, honestly, there are a
number of different places, both in the
[SPEAKER_02]: IRS website, banks, et cetera,
that expect that as a business owner,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have reconciled reconciled accounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's challenging enough,
let alone having all of these extra
[SPEAKER_02]: complications as a cannabis owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know when we start working with new
clients, we we reserve about 90 days just
[SPEAKER_02]: to clean up your books, especially if
you're a business that's coming from one
[SPEAKER_02]: account to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always things that we need to
clean up to make sure that you're running
[SPEAKER_02]: like clockwork on a month end basis,
because that's your minimum requirement as
[SPEAKER_02]: a business owner is to have clean books
that anybody can can look at and review
[SPEAKER_02]: and feel confidence in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betsy, did you have anything you wanted to
add?
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regard, I think Mark said that
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, I would just say,
you know, if if you're a business that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think some people like I'll use the
analogy if you haven't filed your tax
[SPEAKER_01]: return for five years, some people might
feel embarrassed to approach a tax
[SPEAKER_01]: accountant with that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are here to help business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would just encourage if someone
is feeling intimidated by by everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that has to be done from the accounting
perspective, or if they're feeling behind
[SPEAKER_01]: just to, you know, not feel embarrassed
about what they are, where they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can always do our best to fix
things retroactively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the important thing is just to kind of
get get things right going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to end on a positive note,
I do have a very good friend who was on
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical side, wasn't paying taxes and,
you know, for over a decade and was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into a legal canvas facility,
get, you know, get squared up with the IRS
[SPEAKER_00]: by working with directly with the IRS and
his CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in a few years time was
able to show enough income to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: mortgage, purchase a house, and be totally
legal and above board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for him, in this case, just the amount
of stress and everything in getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: all resolved was huge, you know,
knowing that he was above board with the
[SPEAKER_00]: IRS and and it was able to fix some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you absolutely can get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there is there is some work
to do there, but it's it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I super appreciate you guys taking
