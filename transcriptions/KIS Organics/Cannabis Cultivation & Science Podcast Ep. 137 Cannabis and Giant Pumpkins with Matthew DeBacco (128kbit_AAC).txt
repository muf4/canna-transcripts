[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Matthew DiBacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew received his bachelor's degree in
pathology with a secondary degree in
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture, then went on to receive a
master's degree in agronomy in 2011 and a
[SPEAKER_02]: master's in education in 2014,
both from the University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in 2020, he received his PhD from
Ashford University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew started the first cannabis course
at a public university at the University
[SPEAKER_02]: of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I first found out about Matthew from his
research on powdery mildew with cucurbits
[SPEAKER_02]: using raw milk as it was circulating
around the giant pumpkin community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew also enjoys growing giant pumpkins
and has held the state record twice with
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest weighing 1,080 to 885.5
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we talk about the
similarities between the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_02]: community and the cannabis community and
how we might be able to utilize some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the advancements across the cultivation of
these very different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Matthew, thank you so much for coming
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been a follower of you and I've
seen your name on bigpumpkins.com for
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, and this is on me, I didn't
realize you were also producing content in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis space as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm so excited that we were able to
connect when I reached out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to kind of hear a little bit
about your journey, what you're up to,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the topic you suggested,
which is diving in about the comparisons
[SPEAKER_02]: between giant pumpkin growing and
cannabis, which I think is going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating topic, but let's just start
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I teach at the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Connecticut, as well as some
other universities, but I developed the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis course at the University of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the powers at be were very receptive to
offering a new course in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at all the data, I think it's the
first public university to offer such a
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this started back, I think 2019 is
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it took some prep to get to
that point, but that was the first time we
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to offer a intro to cannabis
course at a public university.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was lots of applause and
excitement when we wheeled the plants into
[SPEAKER_01]: the lecture room on that first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before you even got to that,
how we even got in that position actually
[SPEAKER_01]: started with giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know cannabis growers and giant
pumpkin growers may not seem like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of similarities, but there actually
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started hobby growing giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because I wanted to grow,
you know, the biggest pumpkin possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: shall we say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was or this I should say
currently is my 24th year growing giant
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early ages of the Internet, early ages of
sharing information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of trials and a lot of errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what kind of led that is I enjoyed
growing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So progressing with the pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was back when I was in high
school, essentially able to kind of choose
[SPEAKER_01]: my career path.
[SPEAKER_01]: So progressing on post high school to the
university, I was looking at getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: plant science and plant science,
of course, growing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's many different
subcategories from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from there, I kind of progressed or
favored the pathology study of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was in animal science courses
learning about diseases and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: relating them and crossing them over with
plant science courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led then after graduating there to go
on to a master's degree in agronomy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a study of growing field crops
and not necessarily focusing on nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: per se, but looking more at the pathology,
looking more at the diseases that impact
[SPEAKER_01]: economic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a focus on tomatoes as well as
cucurbits, which is, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: your pumpkins and your squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've ever grown a pumpkin or a
squash, pretty much they get white stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaves and it's powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was looking at trying to organically
suppress powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's such a broad disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was grown in cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those powdery mildew is very common on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since this was early on in the
legalization of things across the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, my research paper or my thesis
came up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started being called in by indoor
cannabis facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: What made it difficult was becoming from
the giant pumpkin or the field world into
[SPEAKER_01]: an indoor world is when all the control
and all the different parameters that an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor facility has, but all the plants
that I saw, cannabis plants to start off,
[SPEAKER_01]: were all sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never went to a healthy grow because I
was, quote, the plant doctor, the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: vet, you know, see this plant,
see the tomato, see a eggplant,
[SPEAKER_01]: see a pepper, see a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was approaching it from the disease
aspect and offered a couple of suggestions
[SPEAKER_01]: early on that happened to hit really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, I kept getting called
back and one word of mouth spread to
[SPEAKER_01]: another person, spread to another person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately ended up developing
the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was offered to develop the course and
went that route and kind of now living the
[SPEAKER_01]: double life of the cannabis production in
the cannabis grow indoor facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the outdoor production through
the extension service that we have here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state, as well as the hobbyist growers
for giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of a long kind of
rendition there of about 20-ish,
[SPEAKER_01]: 24-ish or so years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of what led me to where I
am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going back to the course at
Connecticut, who is that course really
[SPEAKER_02]: directed for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an in-person course?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take it online?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just, I'm sure people will have a
few questions about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you research, I think it's hemp
production, University of Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_01]: type that into a search engine and
probably find something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's basically two modalities during
the typical college semester, which starts
[SPEAKER_01]: up end of this month, August, from August
to December.
[SPEAKER_01]: December, January or so, I think December,
I should know my semesters.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the fall semester, that is the
introduction to cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like the basics of how to grow,
how to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's directed at new growers, people who
don't have any interest in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some business majors that take it,
some pharmacy majors that take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to know about the plant,
but the plant science majors do still
[SPEAKER_01]: learn something about it because they get
to work with the plants during the fall
[SPEAKER_01]: semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: That then leads to the spring semester,
which occurs right around January
[SPEAKER_01]: timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the advanced course,
which is assuming you pass the intro
[SPEAKER_01]: course, you progress onto the advanced
course and we get to more of the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still able to grow the plant where
in the intro course, I handle all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pHing and all the watering and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage or the advanced course,
the advantage is the students have passed
[SPEAKER_01]: the intro course and it's kind of on the
student's responsibility to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm their reserve consultant and I direct
them, of course, as we go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: semester, but they've got to decide when
to flip at the flower, decide when to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: water change, decide what nutrients to
add, what pH to run on that and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's for those that can be there at
the University of Connecticut stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: person during the fall and spring
semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I run the same courses during
summer session one and summer session two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those are completely remote and
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those can be taken by anyone in any
state and really anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the world, technically, because it's
the same basic content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to work with the plants
because of the limitations of being
[SPEAKER_01]: online, but you kind of get the same
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of try to do some discussion board
postings, the same information,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same content that I pull from,
of course, with the students experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: the semester to try to bring that
experience as best I can across all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different states and rules and regulations
so they can get a similar experience
[SPEAKER_01]: without necessarily actually touching and
feeling the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So online in the summer session one and
two, intro and advance, which is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: May to August time frame, and then in
person at the physical location of stores
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut in the August to end of April,
early May time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also have a YouTube channel
with an extensive collection of videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have over 100,000 subscribers,
which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just broke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got my silver play button,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an exciting monument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well deserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have over 1,200 videos that you've
published on there, many of which are part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the course itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is an option for people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Debaco University is a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's broken into large playlists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of like the intro to
cannabis one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the advanced cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also deal with some growers and farmers
on the large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a biology subset and a
forensic science playlist on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a student series where some of my
students have been able to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: independent study work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried to highlight some of their
work, actually both working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they've since graduated, but kind of
trying to give them a little start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal of the channel there is
really to provide the scientific based
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientific backed information where we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, we always want to have it
in more detail and we always want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: all the answers to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, of course, are limitations to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the advent of the relaxation of
some of the restrictions on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot more research coming out
specifically on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have not only incorporated a lot of
the content into my intro and advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: course, which you can find maybe not in a
super organized way, but if you search the
[SPEAKER_01]: channel, you'll probably find a topic
that's of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also now diving into more
scientific papers as more research becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a lot of reading of scientific
papers, some I like better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I feel that there's a quality
resource that is published, and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: these take years of data and many
scientists usually working on them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they can be very intimidating to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very difficult to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a different kind of mindset
sometimes to read through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on my channel, some of the more recent
videos, I read through them and I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: give the grower synopsis or the grower
summary for those hardcore scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always link to the original article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to dive into more of the
details or have some specifics about
[SPEAKER_01]: materials or methods or something they
specifically did, of course you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to hopefully give you a little
summary of what the researchers found and
[SPEAKER_01]: how that can relate to your own plants,
how your own growing and try to really
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize that scientific based information
to make sure you have an efficient grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and something that's based on actual
information that hearsay or as a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people say on the channel, the bro
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's let's dive in now with a
little bit of the content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that growers may not
be as familiar with is the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually so I was working when my
father started this compost tea company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started looking on this was
infancy of online forums and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that as well at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started looking for places people
were talking about compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two places I found was an internet
cannabis forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Meg dot com and then big pumpkins
dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still actually on both of those
websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the similarities between the two
groups is really quite fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, let's let's give them a
little bit of history about the giant
[SPEAKER_02]: pumpkin world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time, when I joined,
we were talking about breaking the 1000
[SPEAKER_02]: pound barrier, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this kind of gives you an idea of what
what year it was or around the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was that was the big barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are we going to get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and what that's going to look
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the current world record.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we at now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it is it over 2500 pounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 was 2749, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be even point five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's 49.5, but 2700 plus.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the passion and this is going from seed
to fruit in one season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you literally you literally get to see
it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the breakthroughs
besides obviously genetics improving over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of it was breeding, I think,
that contributed to these growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what were some of the cultivation,
you know, changes that were made that
[SPEAKER_02]: really allowed people to hit that next
stage of growth, the next level?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's really helped just in general is
just the sharing of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that very common in the giant
pumpkin world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll have people we do patch
tours where literally in the summer we go
[SPEAKER_01]: out and we see three, four people's
different patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They invite a bunch of growers in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show them what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to see the comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of how different people handle different
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being in southern New England,
you know, travel up to Vermont or
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts or New Hampshire or Rhode
Island or even in Connecticut here,
[SPEAKER_01]: just having that, you know, camaraderie
and that kind of sharing of information,
[SPEAKER_01]: because despite being, you know,
out here, you know, East Coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in New England, a lot of
small states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to travel very far across the
state border.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a lot of different soil types
in this region, a lot of glacier movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moves to a lot of things, a lot of
river systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of variability in even a
very small geographic area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's seeing how people basically dealt
with those problems, being able to share
[SPEAKER_01]: information to see, you know, what are you
running your pH at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your nutrient levels at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your target levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that really sharing of
information has really been a big leg up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really keeping a lot of the basics
kind of in control, you know, knowing how
[SPEAKER_01]: much water to give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers start off by not giving
them too much water, and then they might
[SPEAKER_01]: flip to giving them too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's finding that kind of happy medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really allowed it, I think,
to progress to the level that we're at is
[SPEAKER_01]: the true blending of the science
information with the plant growing
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'll find cannabis growers
alike and giant pumpkin growers as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they do a lot of scientific reading,
a lot of a lot of information,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not just taking a seat in the
ground and watching it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you might start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's always trying to beat your
personal best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, maybe you want to set a state record
or a world record or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the challenge is to beat
yourself, figure out whatever you grew the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest and what can you beat that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and what can you do and what
kind of improvements can you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: What efficiencies can you tolerate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the weather is the great
variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice particular giant pumpkins
because they're grown pretty much outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be different pockets or regions
that typically have better success than
[SPEAKER_01]: others, just in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always get the one standout,
which is always nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, weather does have
an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, what's allowed us to go from a
thousand pounds to now two thousand plus
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds is that sharing of information in
that utilizing of that scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: information to really drive and make
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers are going to soil
moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, knowing what's actually in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For indoor growers, you know, VPD,
vapor pressure, deficit's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just having an idea of even
outdoors, we can kind of increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really can't reduce it, but we can
increase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point do plants maybe like a
little bit more humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that change when the plant is
small versus when the plant is larger?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that change in the early season
versus the late season?
[SPEAKER_01]: And having growers that get success and
really willing to share information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was at or you know,
we've been fortunate in this region to
[SPEAKER_01]: have different growers set new world
records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've always been very inviting,
always, you know, willing to share the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got other growers that, you know,
growing over even in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: One just did a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some great ones growing right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got several over two thousand
pounds by the measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's by the estimation weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you could type questions
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, you know, they were telling you
what they did, of course, specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: their conditions because they're growing
in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll tell you what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you, you know, what target
levels they're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just gives people a little bit wider
appreciation for the plant and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit wider information birth to kind of
have that idea of, oh, someone did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me maybe try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look more into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm missing something on that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, genetics and
breeding, tracking those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can track them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can track them back into the probably
the mid to early 90s for most pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point now we're going so many
generations back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably doesn't make that much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But crossing pollinations, making those
crosses, finding out what seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: tendency produce more orange pumpkins,
heavier pumpkins, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're not as apt to clone giant
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I did some of that research when we
were getting the first two thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: pounder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually took a sample of the plant that
grew the first two thousand pounder grew
[SPEAKER_01]: in a greenhouse over the winter and use
that to kind of cross breed into a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably one of my more famous
pumpkins, even though only weighed two
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred and twenty pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went on that following year to produce
two pumpkins in the top 10 world weights
[SPEAKER_01]: the following year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just showed the power of
genetics that it came from very unique
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it was only a two hundred and
twenty pound pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the genetics of world records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really went on to produce more of
the wider pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it Snowball because that's what
it looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grown in the winter as giant
pumpkin growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do everything we can in the
summertime to cool our pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's the first ever pumpkin
little flower that was cooled with packs
[SPEAKER_01]: of snow around it because they went
outside the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had big snowstorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pack snow around to keep that area cool
to help increase the odds of pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it set and worked out quite well and
ended up with a two hundred pound pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: that was hard to get out the door,
believe it or not, in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to work it through the door and
got some seeds, sent them to different
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, and they were able to grow them
that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, genetics play a role sharing of
information and really just getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger population or data set to figure
out what really is ideal for these
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had a slightly different
experience of perspective, and I totally
[SPEAKER_02]: agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the sharing information, correct and
correct me if anything is wrong here in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of my recollection of it or how I
perceived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seemed to me when I first started
experiencing the giant pumpkin community,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of what was going on was it was a
lot of like chemical growing primarily and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were willing to try just about
anything if someone did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're called like heavy hitters is
the term in the giant pumpkin community.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow at the time over and they keep
raising the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that is, it might be eight hundred
pounds, a thousand pounds, fifteen
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred, two thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a special jacket that you can
win.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole it's a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are so passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can you imagine dedicating an
entire greenhouse literally for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: one or two pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these these people are very passionate
and they're very smart and they care
[SPEAKER_02]: deeply about what they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I what I found initially was it
was a lot of chemical growing and then
[SPEAKER_02]: people started incorporating back in,
you know, someone heard about mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi, for example, and people started
incorporating some organics back into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at adding organic matter,
high quality compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of this hybridization of
organics and synthetics that has allowed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, larger, larger yields,
I guess, in a sense, if we want to compare
[SPEAKER_02]: it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add a few other, you know, things I
noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes down to the the timing of
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is true for cannabis as well
as giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, chemicals were, you know,
the quote unquote miracle girl blend was
[SPEAKER_01]: great because you add it and the next day
your plants are super green and super tall
[SPEAKER_01]: and super big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, aggressive green plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's we've now kind of shifted a
little bit away from that, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And utilizing that more when the soil is
cold, when the microbes just can't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture as much nitrogen or make as
many nutrients as available as the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little chemical early on and then if
needed and then really relying on organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the old school thought was,
you know, the ideal would be a four foot
[SPEAKER_01]: deep raised bed of just all the compost
that you could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shifted away from that because too
much of a good thing is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought about a lot of disease
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought about a lot of water
retention issues that we can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: quote, get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought a lot of nitrogen,
which for giant pumpkins can make the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves really tall and big, which looks
really impressive on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an Instagram post, but really doesn't do a
lot of good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it very brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis growers have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you over add nitrogen and you
walk by a plant and the branches usually
[SPEAKER_01]: just break, they don't have that nice kind
of gizz sort of speak to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing that shift towards more
chemicals when needed in small doses early
[SPEAKER_01]: on to kind of get the plant initially
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going and then utilizing the soil because
most are grown in some sort of soil base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that could be higher clay,
higher sand, higher silt again,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the region in the area,
but usually amended, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: with some organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the ideal target, depending who you
talk to, it will give you a different
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, looking at, I'd say a minimum of
like five, six, seven percent up to 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 would kind of be the theoretical range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some growers have 20 percent and it's
a little harder to grow in that more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently because it just holds so much
more water and you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen bloat just when the heat comes in
in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So utilizing those organics to kind of
keep the plant going, shifting now almost
[SPEAKER_01]: not away from chemical fertilizers,
but really shifting away from the quantity
[SPEAKER_01]: of chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, giant pumpkin, thousand pounds,
we'll just say it doesn't need a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a couple key things at key
moments and how a lot of the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: growers will assess this tissue testing
where they'll actually take a sample of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf, the petiola in particular,
send that off and kind of get an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, correlate that with their
with their soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after you do it for a couple of years,
you kind of learn that definitely giant
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkins pull a lot of potassium out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one key thing that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cannabis and pumpkins, they do not
need as much phosphorus as so many growers
[SPEAKER_01]: think that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little bit of an issue in the
giant pumpkin community, I would say early
[SPEAKER_01]: on, where we had a couple of growers have
great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone gravitated to their soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's see your soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see your tissue test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had very high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the issue with that from the
scientific standpoint was, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had big pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not arguing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had done that through organic
matter additions, mainly manure based,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'd brought their phosphorus really
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what the issue was that people were
correlating if they have a giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is their soil test, this is what
I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the potassium maybe you've been
higher and that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other aspects and ratios and
balances were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their phosphorus, what growers didn't
realize and cannabis growers, I still kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of try to convey this to people is they
think that they need this high phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: level and you really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard concept to get across to
people that have been told for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: years, phosphorus makes roots and that's
what you need and it helps with the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your bloom fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: High phosphorus, high phosphorus,
high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really just not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back, I don't remember the exact year,
but when I grew the state record here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut, and that was the time many
years ago, it was only 1,300 pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to today's standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my phosphorus levels was almost
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was around four to 20,
depending on when you took the sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got growers that are growing 10
times that and more than that because they
[SPEAKER_01]: think they need high phosphorus to get
that growth and you really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's always hard to run that control
when it's like, oh, I'm not going to not
[SPEAKER_01]: add phosphorus because that was where we
added phosphorus and nerves were really
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those that grew really big pumpkin,
it's just the plants just can't utilize it
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as growers think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where, again, where in the
cannabis world, got a lot of growers add
[SPEAKER_01]: bone meal, which is a great source of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste product from the slaughter
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blood meal and bone meal, great things
to be able to utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using it in an auto flower
or you're using in a very quick cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: turnaround time for cannabis in
particular, you're probably not getting as
[SPEAKER_01]: much phosphorus as you added.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little while to break that
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better for a living soil, better for a
longer term grow operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got a lot of growers that are
adding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it is phosphorus, but you've got
to look at plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing a really quick
turnaround and dumping the soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing that out, you might be wasting
some of your money there where if you put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a compost and kind of get it to
break down and then supplement it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and or worm castings to kind of
help buffer and keep the organics there as
[SPEAKER_01]: a stable source.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be a better
utilization to be getting a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of the education of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always love the the bloom based
fertilizers that are like 45 to 50 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how concentrated some chemical
fertilizers are that are out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: people and growers are utilizing pretty
extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, they just don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the research I'm seeing shows a
little bit more of a potassium need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then say a high, high phosphorus need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still in some more of the research,
more of the scientific literature to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's trending definitely in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have any major harm of less
phosphorus being added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it's a freshwater ground water
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got environmental aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're importing more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a limited resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole bunch of other aspects
to consider more than just your plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great point around
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do see like when we do a complete
soil test, sometimes we'll see varying
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of phosphorus on the malic test,
the acid extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go to a saturated paste test
and a water extraction and that
[SPEAKER_02]: availability in some cases can be quite
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we target off the top of my head
around two ppm and sometimes we're at
[SPEAKER_02]: point eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we still have very healthy,
happy plants in an organic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do on occasion will need to supplement
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do that, if we want something
faster acting, that's typically something
[SPEAKER_02]: like fish hydrolysate, because that allows
us to get phosphoric acid in there in an
[SPEAKER_02]: NOP approved format.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do agree, especially outdoors in
soil, because most of the growers we work
[SPEAKER_02]: with are indoors, no runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that phosphate is not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do agree that, yeah, especially
outdoors, we really need to limit and
[SPEAKER_02]: control our phosphorus use just from an
environmental perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or once you get it to a level,
you don't have to keep adding everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I added a pound this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add a pound next year and a pound the
year after.
[SPEAKER_01]: It levels off at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I would say more so Rocky
Mountain-ish area probably would benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from some initial doses of phosphorus,
but you don't have to keep adding it every
[SPEAKER_01]: year, which I think is the mentality that,
well, I added this and I had a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to keep adding this to have the
same success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't quite work that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also find phosphorus sources tend to
bring in heavy metals, which is not really
[SPEAKER_02]: a pumpkin concern so much as a cannabis
concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just being aware of how you can limit
that will also help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what's essentially happening,
a lot of it locally being United States
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we're importing more
and more phosphorus is we still have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phosphorus in Florida, but the purity
is going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning as you're getting deeper and
deeper into the phosphorus mines,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting more contaminants,
more potential for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still phosphorus, but it's cheaper
right now, at least, to import in
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and to refine it and to take
out some of those impurities with the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus mines that they're currently
going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, bone meal is actually a very clean
source of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I think about it, and fish bone
usually is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, when we talk about things like
soft rock phosphate, yeah, we are
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely getting heavy metals and other
contaminants in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, getting back to this comparison
between giant pumpkins and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The collaboration in the giant pumpkin
community is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a whole nother level, even beyond
what we see in cannabis, I think because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always been been legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you found?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you talked a little bit about some
of this idea of what people call bro
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the things that happened
in the giant pumpkin community that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be similar to that bro science?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just off the top of my head with
cannabis, you know, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: people said if you apply Kool-Aid,
your buds will be sweeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of those sorts of things
that have worked their way through the
[SPEAKER_02]: giant pumpkin community over the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say just the trend and it
continues to be just the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, but the reduction in volume of
nutrients, the reduction in growing a
[SPEAKER_01]: monster looking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these plants get big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to think that they're keeping
these really teeny tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't need or I don't really want
to see leaves that are three foot wide and
[SPEAKER_01]: three foot tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You overhead nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you will get a giant leaf and it will
look huge, but it will typically speed
[SPEAKER_01]: age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were associating giant plants
with giant pumpkins and giant everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything should be bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going to be a field
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a giant pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we noticed again through sharing
information that come June, July.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the plants looked ginormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants looked huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting their pumpkins set.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pumpkins were looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times, if you were went back
to those plate patches now, the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: August, they had a lot of browning to
their leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot more disease potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to tail in their growth a lot
quicker than say a weaker looking and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in quotes, a weaker looking plant
that was just, I call it the right color
[SPEAKER_01]: green, the right height, not overly pushed
in those regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of been one aspect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been proven out actually
through giant pump growers themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, I grow a plant that's
approximately 32 feet wide by 35 to 40
[SPEAKER_01]: feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about a thousand to 1200 square
feet is one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of growers don't have that
space, but they still want to try to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: a giant pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a contest out there that's been
running now for probably seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the 150 square foot contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this concept is, and it's a
really great concept, you're allowed 150
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet to grow your pumpkin and your
pumpkin plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's got to fit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your vines, your pumpkin, you can't layer
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have the pumpkin on a shelf and
grow vines under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the pumpkin and the plant has
got to be contained in 150 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how you make the design a triangle,
a rectangle, a square of diamond,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you come up with, that's up to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're only allowed 150 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has created a big challenge
because now you've got to fit the pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, and everything is in a very
small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's about the 10th of a size of
quote, a normal pumpkin plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand-ish square feet to potentially
larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has taught us a lot that we've had
a grower who I've actually known.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the world record for 150 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that small area, he grew a 1000
square feet 375 pound pumpkin in that
[SPEAKER_01]: small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has got us thinking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, of course, it's not the world record
at 2700 pounds, but in 150 square feet
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin and everything, how much excess
are we growing the plant and how much is a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger plant potentially for growing the
pumpkin growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a really interesting
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, in 150 square feet,
you've got to make sure everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're water, you know, you've got to just
have not a lot of room for error.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have hail that comes in or
something that damages a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you've got less odds of growing a
bigger pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been multiple thousand pound plus
pumpkins grown in this very small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has kind of got us away from
thinking that each leaf produces two
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just say each leaf produces a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an old school of thought that if
I want a thousand pound pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to have a thousand leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a 2000 pound pumpkin, I need 2000
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't quite work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a 1300 pound pumpkin in
150 square feet, each leaf is producing
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit because each square foot
essentially is producing, I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like six or seven pounds on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gotten away from the increasing
of plant size concept to increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiencies of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I still grow in a thousand square
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that's your best chance at
the potential for a world record.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have that area,
which I know many people don't 150 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, when you start weighing it out,
it looks really small and you don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you can grow anything in that,
but you could potentially grow a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: plus pound pumpkin in that small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's increased the amount of people
we can get growing these, which again,
[SPEAKER_01]: helps the sharing of information and just
helps the whole community overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the key things of like
bigger plant, bigger pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis growers were well
ahead of that with their pruning methods
[SPEAKER_01]: and their limitations of being only in a
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, screen of green really isn't
quite the option for a pumpkin growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I call it the lily pad effect where I
want all my leaves kind of edge to edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have leaves shading other
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of maximize that canopy,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a similar concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumpkins weigh in pounds, cannabis weighs
in grams, but it's still all about weight
[SPEAKER_01]: in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one really sees the plant per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only see the production from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of, again, same concept there of
having a life cycle to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just pushing the heck out of it early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 I've done some experiments with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really improved growth on pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, gotten from the cannabis industry
and greenhouse industry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really trying to prove that, yes,
this is some concepts are universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help with pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be some sharing of information
as well across the two platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was growing, and this was over a
decade ago, and I want to say for people
[SPEAKER_02]: out there that are interested in trying
it, I had an empty space in my garden at
[SPEAKER_02]: my farm back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got seeds from friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Ryan Ewing out here in the
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may know Ryan and Don in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's Emans or Emmons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen them in a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them Emmons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Former world record holders themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were one of the people that told
me, and this was again, like probably 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years ago now is less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that she was really big
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were very accommodating and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew, I'll just say it was a 725
pound pumpkin, which by giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_02]: standards is a toddler.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did it with a lot of neglect and no
soil testing in just the soil that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: at the farm, watered when we remembered
and pruned it when I had a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the improvement in genetics and
everything, I think it's very possible for
[SPEAKER_02]: a new grower as a hobby, if they're not
going for old world record, but just wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to experiment to get out there and grow a
really fun, large pumpkin that I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: say the kids had a ton of fun with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fed it to the chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afterwards, it was a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage people to, if you're
interested in a hobby in growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: really want to see a plant actually
physically grow in front of your eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll go out there and it'll be the
size, let's say of a golf ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day it'll be a baseball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next day it'll be a beach
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to add anything
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would again promote for new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot that had had success and
we're like, where did you come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, I found bigpumpkins
.com would be the website that Tad
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be probably your best single
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you are going to be inundated with
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot there, but I would say to
try to make it a little easier on someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the grower diaries in
bigpumpkins.com and try to find,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it's usually listed by, of course
everyone's handle name, and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: usually lists their general location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an idea of, you know,
the region, you might want to pick a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of growers in that region and kind
of see what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a lot of growers come out of
the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden they show up out of way
off and no one's ever heard of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And simply through the research that
they've done online, literally through
[SPEAKER_01]: bigpumpkins.com, they've really been able
to speed up the learning curve or to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of get some ideas of what people utilize
in some areas for those people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for a point of example, they're using
a lot more shade netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because they're higher elevation and
two, unfortunately they get a lot of hail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the shade netting protects the plants
from hail and also shades them a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more because they don't need all the
sun that they're getting and all the UV
[SPEAKER_01]: light that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just one little tip and trick
there for people in that region where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing it utilized more and more now
in other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause pumpkins don't quite need all the
sun that they're able to get even at sea
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just one kind of little way to
help forego a season loss from a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: little hail storm that comes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that I would add,
just to bring up that anyone who's new to
[SPEAKER_01]: growing always thinks this is something to
get all the fairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where this started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I knew where it started because the
marketing campaign on this is
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thinks that we milk feed
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add milk, you inject milk,
you do something with milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you 100%, no one that I know
and I've known many world record growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: no one injects milk at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I think that came about looking back
at it is back in the day, someone grew
[SPEAKER_01]: some really big pumpkins and they came up
with this weird concept that they inject
[SPEAKER_01]: milk into their pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they kept winning year after
year, people like all these winnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be like the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the farmer was very clever in
what he came up with because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about milk in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ferments and it grows bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're injecting that into the
vine, you're going to rot your vines out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this grower was very smart in
saying this is what he did so that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone went out and tried it and rotted
all their vines out and he kept winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as one thing that giant pumpkin
growers do not do that, for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, everyone thinks that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't inject any milk into the
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't inject any milk into the vines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really do anything, particularly
with milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that you could use milk
for, which was part of my research,
[SPEAKER_01]: was how you can spray it on the leaves to
reduce powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when that first came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big deal for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, actually I was talking to a fruit
grower yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was experimenting with milk because of
that paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the one complaint I have about milk is
that it's white and it leaves a residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks a little like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get the same success using
lactobacillus, for example, or is it the
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymes in the milk itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I make a rice wash?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown, I know with, out of a
cow, we'll call it raw milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown with pasteurized milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown with whey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown with all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure quite about that source
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage to the milk, and it's kind
of like at a three-part kind of active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient, it's basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew likes an acidic kind of
environment, so the basicness of the milk
[SPEAKER_01]: helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the fat, if you're using,
I usually recommend whole milk if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to choose a milk, because that helps
coat the leaves so you get a little better
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of binds up on the surface of the
leaf so that if powdery mildew is to land
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaf, it doesn't recognize it's on
host and it just kind of stays dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't start to grow and produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's different concentrations you
can utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage to it, you can't burn a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had growers that put a high
concentration, go out in high noon,
[SPEAKER_01]: super strong sun to try to burn the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying go spray in high noon,
but you can utilize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real major negative side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go too high in concentration,
it smells a little bit like a cheese
[SPEAKER_01]: factory, but a couple of rainstorms that
usually goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there can be some residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% or so, up to 40% milk, and the rest
just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually works just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really helpful for folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other thing I was thinking of in
regards to milk is the calcium needs of
[SPEAKER_02]: both cannabis and pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that was part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know plants need calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the idea was that milk added
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: We typically would use things like gypsum
or lime to properly manage the agronomy in
[SPEAKER_02]: your field, to be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just an interesting concept
that somehow, universally, at every fair
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked at, I answer questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's like, oh, you milk feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite talking to hundreds of thousands
of people and telling them we don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always a couple people that come
in and still think we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one thing I do want to bring up is
it's really fun for folks, especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do want to grow a giant pumpkin,
there's typically competitions in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the Seattle area, and there's a few
local weigh-offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is at the largest fair that we have in
the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take your pumpkin there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can win cash prizes, though they're
typically not going to compensate you for
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of time that you put into the
pumpkin or the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun process, and it's a really
heartwarming community to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's really accommodating and
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up giant pumpkin weigh-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: California's got the biggest one on the
West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Half Moon Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Columbus Day weekend somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's that Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the biggest one out West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for giant pumpkins, and it's great to
meet the growers if you find out when the
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh-off is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to get ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually very willing to share
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in getting into the
community, it is a very welcoming
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to change directions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big product guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a company that sells products,
but I always like to look at plants by
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the limiting factor of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's not fertility, but when it
is fertility, I want to think about what
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of things do I like to have in my
pantry?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned gypsum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite amendments for
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you as a grower like to keep in
your quote unquote pantry to have on hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't keep very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: For pumpkins, something that probably
isn't well-known, and I try to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: people, I believe they're higher manganese
consumers than most people realize,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's MN, not MG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not magnesium, but manganese, MN.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something it looks like in
continuing to do research, continuing to
[SPEAKER_01]: see some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese sulfate is one I definitely make
sure I keep on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is probably something that most
growers aren't realizing or even
[SPEAKER_01]: considering, I guess, at the most point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of gypsum for your calcium,
the other key component, yes, you can add
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of calcium, and that's great,
but really what helps get it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always keep boron on hand because that
helps with calcium availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I say keep boron on hand,
I think I bought a five-pound bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: solu-bor or four-pound bag of solu-bor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I barely used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it quite a bit, but it's very
small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at, again, that trend going
back to our previous conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep these nutrients on hand, yes,
but it doesn't mean I'm adding them pound
[SPEAKER_01]: by pound by pound by pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike a gypsum, I would add by pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one you can add quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other ones, these
specialty ones, very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like a little, and again,
it's another little one, calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_01]: for your nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some sort of nitrogen source,
particularly when you get a lot of heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got actually national news in
Connecticut here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just literally unexpectedly,
no tropical storm, no hurricane,
[SPEAKER_01]: no anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some towns not very far from here
get over a foot of rain in a 24-hour
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say very rare in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one in thousand year storm or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that's going to do is that's
going to flush a lot of your nitrogen out,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as some other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nitrogen's usually going to be the
first to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have a little nitrogen source
just to give something back to help buffer
[SPEAKER_01]: that leaching effect that may have
occurred in the event you get a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: rainstorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to keep some nitrogen source on
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do keep a little bit of a name
brand-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Plant Marvel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a KMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a 15-5-30, somewhere around
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 15% nitrogen, 5% phosphorus,
30% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blue chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep a little of that on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains a lot of microbes,
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick little supplement will feed
that checks all the little boxes if I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to just give a general supplementation
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of growers don't realize is
probably what I rely on most is just
[SPEAKER_01]: compost that I've added.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say I've added compost,
I have not added compost in five to seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the levels up to where I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was leaf-based compost out here in the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of maple trees and some
oak trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to rake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mulch them up and let them sit for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The town actually provides the leaf-based
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They suck up all the leaves and provide it
back to the residents.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added a fair amount of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added about 30-40 yards of that per
thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it once, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back, probably a little on the
heavy side, but I have not needed to add
[SPEAKER_01]: any compost for the last five to seven
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look back at my records when I
added it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, with that concept, you get to that
level, and you don't need to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: re-adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to add 20 yards of compost
every single year to keep getting the same
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the stable soil, shall we say,
and now I'm just supplementing the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought up a ton of great stuff,
and I have some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, with the K man, is that sulfate
or potash magnesium?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wrong proprietary blend,
I'm sure, but it is basically a potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really get the 30% plus potassium,
and it's got just a general mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can get you the exact.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds a little different than K man,
as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say it's the Plant Marvel's
version of K mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: K mag, I know they make an organic
version.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know this because we sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dissolves in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like little crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a little different than what
you're describing just for people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: listening and trying to find the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing around nitrogen I want to
mention, a good friend, Brian Mason,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's a wonderful agronomist, talks about
how nitrogen is primarily cycled based
[SPEAKER_02]: around temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get cold temperatures, you may also
need to supplement nitrogen as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaching effect that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with trace minerals, I just want to
mention with us, with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: on our target recommendations,
we haven't been adding in trace minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: because we typically get some from the
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm talking about mostly indoor
soilless media for comparison for people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are listening too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've recently started adding some of
those back in at low levels, but we have
[SPEAKER_02]: found with a lot of cannabis growers is
they add too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much is much worse than too little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to emphasize that because when
you get too high on, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically boron, you can really create
toxicities that will do more damage than
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have started making a manganese
recommendation on our soil test for folks
[SPEAKER_02]: because with cannabis, we are seeing
actually that a little bit of a manganese
[SPEAKER_02]: hunger more so than we had realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something that we also are focused
on with our cannabis recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to highlight that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're relying primarily on creating a
healthy soil with good levels of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, good biology from the compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that you're managing that soil and
then you're supplementing that based off
[SPEAKER_02]: of your soil test, it sounds like,
and tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the soil hydroponics concept,
which I know is going to drive a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growers crazy because soil and
hydroponics don't seem like they meet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but using the soil as the basis of most of
the nutrients, the nutrient load I should
[SPEAKER_01]: say, and then hydroponically are
supplementing in these very light dose
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers as the plants need or as the
weather conditions warrant or as the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: develops at a certain stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying, as pumpkin grows,
it needs a little bit more potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: so spoon feeding and dosing a little bit
of that maybe a little bit later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season, but not really adding hundreds and
hundreds of pounds of fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: really just feeding what the plant needs
and what the plant might be running short
[SPEAKER_01]: on or what the microbes just can't keep up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're saying early in the season
when the soil is cold after a heavy rain
[SPEAKER_01]: event, the microbes will make nitrogen,
but in those conditions, maybe they just
[SPEAKER_01]: need a little help or the plant just needs
a little bit so it doesn't go hungry and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it back off and let the microbes kind
of re-feed into the ecosystem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not overriding everything and not
being completely dependent on everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it, but just that supplemental feed
for the pumpkin or cannabis would be in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to mention the plant marvel
product so people can find it if they are
[SPEAKER_02]: curious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I can send it to you if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Plant Marvel Nutriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called their K-Bang spoon feeding
soluble fertilizer, 15,530 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I was sponsored by someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not sponsored by them,
but that is one that has a good general,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say miracle grow like
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really dissolves well in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for a quick feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for just a good supplemental
feed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not organic just for any... Unfortunately,
not organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to clarify, but yes, that is an
option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we talked about phosphorus a little
bit and it's really an issue of
[SPEAKER_02]: maintaining low levels of phosphorus
availability more so than having this
[SPEAKER_02]: massive reserve that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were over applying it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts around mycorrhizal
fungi?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's associated with increased
nutrient uptake of a lot of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: but phosphorus is the big one that people
talk about when they talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know from talking to pumpkin growers,
a lot of them were adding it for the
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary vines at all the nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts around not just the
use of mycorrhizal fungi, but also the
[SPEAKER_02]: application rates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to be adding it every planting
directly to the roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: For mycorrhizae in general, it does
phosphorus really well as well as copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the second one it helps a lot
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does in general, for those just
listening to give you a quick background,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it basically creates a better net in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pumpkin root, a cannabis root is quite
large and it's really the root hairs that
[SPEAKER_01]: do a lot of the absorption while the
fungus is really fine and really helps
[SPEAKER_01]: increase soil contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really helps be able to come in
contact with phosphorus so it can absorb
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage is the fungus will give the
phosphorus essentially to the plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: host plant, cannabis, pumpkin,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: In exchange, the plant gives the fungus
sugar so the fungus can grow better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus is getting sugar from the plant
and the plant's getting phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some copper from the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a true symbiotic relationship,
meaning they're both benefiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus loves it because it's in the
soil, can't do photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars are hard to come by, but the
plant's got all its leaves up above ground
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's able to absorb all the sun and
it's got excess sugars, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it gives the fungus there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do we need to add or how much
damage are we doing it to it potentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, these really fine networks
like a fishnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you till your soil, of course,
you're going to be chopping up a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those mycelium, a lot of those hyphae,
a lot of those kind of nice little network
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what pumpkin growers were doing is they
were adding it at every leaf node because
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever there's a leaf node for giant
pumpkins, as well as some other pumpkins,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will set down a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the concept was when that root comes
out, we want the fungus there so it can
[SPEAKER_01]: start to form that association really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it seems like in what I've seen,
at least from the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, is that because the plants
grow so aggressively, I'm not sure how
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a benefit the plants are getting
from the phosphorus uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be a little more
limiting, shall we say, that if I add a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid feed of a little phosphorus,
I think that's more plant readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the host plant because
they're growing, quote, so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for adding mycorrhizae, I used to add
it in the planting hole and at the vine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but building up enough in your soil,
there's going to be a lot of natural
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae, potentially a lot of natural
back material in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I personally don't add any of it
anymore to my pumpkin plant, to as a vine
[SPEAKER_01]: berry or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel creating the organic matter base
that I have is creating a favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for those all to kind of live
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I think mycorrhizae offers by far
the best advantage, and this is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different than cannabis, a little
different than pumpkins, is for foresty
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in forest regions where there's trees
growing, where really nutrients are very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to come by and there's a very
stressful condition there because yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be recycling some of the leaves
and they bring some organic matter up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but forest region, you dig down in a
forest, you get down a couple inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be a very difficult soil to really
support large plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having the mycorrhizae in that
instance is very beneficial because one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not tilling up the soil very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those trees are going to establish that
mycelium quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be tilled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to benefit from the
stressful conditions that they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is definitely where
mycorrhizae can really offer a potential
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of the annual producing areas,
I think the benefits might be more
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting, just simply of the general
practices that we do, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that true establishment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly how much of a benefit
that's truly offering in annual there
[SPEAKER_01]: might be some initial benefits,
but long range as far as mining all the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus by time they produce all that
mycelium, get all those little hairs out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odds are the plant's probably going to be
to term and it's going to be ready quote
[SPEAKER_01]: for next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've probably established enough of
those resting spores in there for the
[SPEAKER_01]: following year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other thoughts around mycorrhizal
fungi and feel free to correct me too if
[SPEAKER_02]: you say anything that you disagree with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mycorrhizal fungi, high levels of
phosphorus applications will limit
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're applying phosphoric acid,
for example, you may limit the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: desire, I guess, or need to form that
relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a symbiotic relationship,
so it needs to come in direct contact with
[SPEAKER_02]: the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point in scattering it
throughout your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, these fertilizers that listed
on there don't assume that the spore count
[SPEAKER_02]: is high enough to get infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they'll put in just a pinch
and then say, with mycorrhizal fungi on
[SPEAKER_02]: the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really want to get a specific
inoculant for the specific type of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means if you're growing,
the good news is most of these are endo
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi, but you want to get the
right species, which could be rhizophagus
[SPEAKER_02]: irregularis, glomus interaticis,
glomus maceae.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're specific ones for, and it's the
same for fruit trees, cucurbits,
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all utilize the same sort of sets of
endo mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, you just want to make sure
when you look on the label, what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting mapped is what you actually need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've seen products that contain
both endo and ecto mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you may have 50 spores per cc of endo
mycorrhizal, and then like 1.2 million
[SPEAKER_02]: spores of ecto mycorrhizal, which is
specific to conifers and these forestry
[SPEAKER_02]: situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're not really forming a
relationship with your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you need to do a little research if
you are going to use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're resting in an area and you kind
of want to build up the mycorrhizae in
[SPEAKER_01]: that area, the quickest zinnias,
which is a beautiful flower, has got one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the highest mycorrhizae association
plants and really can help build up
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe that's what most of the
more commercial producers of said
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae are using actually zinnia
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you find little root fragments,
they're probably zinnias because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: increased association and ease of
association, I should say, that those
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're resting in an area and really
want to build up that mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculate your zinnia seeds, plant your
zinnias, enjoy your zinnias, and you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing good for the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really useful tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing I want to mention
is I did see some research out of Italy
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about using mycorrhizal fungi in
conjunction with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found was an increased
uptake of heavy metals, which makes sense
[SPEAKER_02]: to me based on understanding the pathways
of how heavy metals are taken up and how
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is a dynamic accumulator and how
mycorrhizal fungi also helps increase that
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are in a state where you're
being regulated for heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using soilless media that contains
some heavy metals, I would caution folks
[SPEAKER_02]: before adding mycorrhizal fungi in some of
the tighter regulated states just for that
[SPEAKER_02]: reason, something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say I've got something on the
channel on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it could be the same study.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reached out to the researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to get her on the podcast,
but I don't have any luck with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try and track it down though
before we publish this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think at least for us,
heavy metals is a bigger and bigger issue
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just searched heavy metal on your
YouTube channel as well, and I got a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some information on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any highlights regarding
heavy metals that you wanted to touch on
[SPEAKER_02]: for growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that growers should be
looking at in their COAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my biggest right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation there is it is
definitely something that consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, whoever need to be mindful of
that that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have mycorrhizae for cannabis
production, I do have the video on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sound Italian names.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from 2005 looking at cadmium,
nickel, and chromium, significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing translocation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful, folks, if you're thinking
about using these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also be aware with heavy metals
that compost and water are probably two of
[SPEAKER_02]: your biggest sources of contamination in
addition to fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I typically see higher levels in
coming in from compost and from water
[SPEAKER_02]: sources than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always start with those two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been chatting for a while
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guy, was there any last little pointers or
comparisons that you wanted to make
[SPEAKER_02]: between giant pumpkin growers and the
cannabis industry, cannabis growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would say again, if you're a
cannabis grower, I honestly check out
[SPEAKER_01]: bigpumpkins.com would be a great resource
there to just see what the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: community is doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little more seasonal because
they're not really growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's something there to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for cannabis growers themselves,
again, the YouTube channel there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tobacco university would be something
I'd recommend them to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to respond to every comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets tough at certain times,
but if you type a comment in, I do try to
[SPEAKER_01]: get back to you at least one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask a follow up question,
I probably will miss that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate you having me on the
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people have other specific
questions or if you want to have me on
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I'd always be willing to come on
for another round there, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate the work that you're
putting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, please do reach out to Matthew
and check out his YouTube channel and
[SPEAKER_02]: check out his course at Connecticut,
University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
