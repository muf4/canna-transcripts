[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Steve Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve is a former mixed martial artist and
entrepreneur known for his time in the UFC
[SPEAKER_00]: and his involvement with Green Life
Productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve was born in Long Beach, California,
and he began training in martial arts at a
[SPEAKER_00]: young age and developed a passion for
combat sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2005, Cantwell made his professional
MMA debut and quickly gained attention for
[SPEAKER_00]: his aggressive fighting style and
well-rounded skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: He amassed an impressive record in
regional promotions, which led to his
[SPEAKER_00]: signing with the UFC in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent years, Cantwell has focused his
entrepreneurial endeavors, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded Green Life Productions in 2014,
a prominent Las Vegas-based cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation company.
[SPEAKER_00]: GLP is known for its organic and
sustainable approach to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, producing high-quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cantwell's involvement with GLP has
allowed him to combine his passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurship with his interest in
health and wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: His contributions to the company reflect
his ongoing dedication to promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable and responsible practices
within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have done this a long time ago,
in all honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you and I met at the Grassroots
Conference earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some great conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hear you speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start off telling listeners a
little about you and Green Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Green Life Productions is kind of
a company me and my wife and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: about nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started off in Nevada as a medical patient
after retiring from mixed martial arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my whole medical card, did the whole
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing plants, my 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife got her card, 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the whole experimental dungeon
basement grows and all that kind of cool
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff back in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just over time, just kind of
partnered up with a lot of really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: people that led a lot of really cool
people over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just had this crazy idea of growing a
regenerative cannabis business and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: using that to, I guess, make farming cool
again was kind of the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ran into some old sponsors, kind of got a
self-funded little small town group of
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, kind of funded us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really small, not a big corporate company,
even though we kind of tend to play the
[SPEAKER_01]: role online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thinks we're bigger than we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just been real grassroots, just fighting
the good fight from Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is your facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: What size is your veg space and your
flower rooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole facility is about 12,000 square
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our property is an old ACE hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have about 30,000 square foot
building in front that we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're just renting out to Goodwill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The back half was the original lumber yard
of the ACE hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we completely gutted this old lumber
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was old, rusty old lumber yard and
turned into, well, eight years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A state-of-the-art cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to me, it's like a Titanic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a dinosaur considering it's been
eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine what we've all as an industry
learned in eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12,000 square foot is what we're
currently operating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about 24, 2,500 square foot each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our veg space, we have kind of a unique
veg space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't repeat this model again,
but we have a walking through veg space to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of save some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even, I don't even know the square
footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small, probably about 1,000 square
foot or 500 square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've, you build up quite a following
over the years because your facility is so
[SPEAKER_00]: unique and you really take these
regenerative practice ideas really to like
[SPEAKER_00]: the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you and I have some
philosophical differences on a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few topics, which we'll definitely get
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think a lot of people want to hear
that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk a little bit about first
to share sort of your overall philosophy
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the things that you have
brought into this facility that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to green life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's what we're doing now is,
is, is kind of trendy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest, you see a lot of it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are switching over trying,
you know, LEDs with living soil and raised
[SPEAKER_01]: beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, nine years ago when we were
building this facility, you did not see
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lights, you know, in a large scale
commercial facility hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had a lot of people switching over,
raised beds full of living soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were pretty much unheard of eight,
nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, at first I was more of a,
of a laughing joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the end of a lot of memes,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Internet is very unrelenting sometimes,
but over the years, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just proven it through and through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea is just nature knows best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I first started eight years ago,
I didn't have a huge college background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go to school for this I was a
medical patient looking for a more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable way to manage my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming from an inmate background So as
I kind of went through my own little
[SPEAKER_01]: journey I just kind of started like
looking at things differently as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic versus organics and It kind of
turned me on to a lot of things as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know as a professional fighter We we
manage everything that went into our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally had to report it before we
fought like hey, this is why I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: taken So I was very big on inputs just as
a professional athlete and then we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: soil I started growing cannabis and I
remember it was purely medicine And then
[SPEAKER_01]: one day I happened to tell my coach and he
was like, hey, well that that medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing Do you use chemicals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, of course I got
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what plants, you know used to grow to
the need And he told me well they use
[SPEAKER_01]: these chemicals to make drugs and that was
his mindset on his whole little crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: theory on it I was like As crazy as it was
it made a little bit of sense So I started
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at some more organic methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off a bottle of nutrients I
immediately noted I noticed a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of flavor difference from that Then I got
to the more recycled organic living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: at their goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we used to call it That's why I
met Matt Davenport and on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: got big into permaculture and living soils
And then when I got introduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture living soils, I kind of seen
that as like what cannabis was for me it
[SPEAKER_01]: was it was the This medicine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen permaculture was like this this
medicine for the planet It's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet needed to get healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought man if I could connect these
two things if I could, you know tie
[SPEAKER_01]: Permaculture sustainable agriculture
living soils to this cool cannabis scene
[SPEAKER_01]: that's popping off Maybe we can get that
word out there and use it cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_01]: gateway drug To sustainable farming to
sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the goal That was kind
of my mindset going into it and it's over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years has been blessed that the
university kind of connecting me to the
[SPEAKER_01]: right people at the right time and Overall
just it's just try to be as organic as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible I try to rip off mother nature as
much as possible but at the same time I
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta be realistic and be able to manage
and run a business and In order to keep my
[SPEAKER_01]: business sustainable and to keep it
regenerative has to be sustainable before
[SPEAKER_01]: to be sustainable I have to pay the bills
to keep the lights on So I had to wear a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of different hats but the end of the
day As long as the intentions are good
[SPEAKER_01]: tensions appear it all kind of works
itself out Yeah, and I know social media
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of those things where We all put
our best foot forward in a lot of cases
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had a really bad crop or
something that you did that led to poor
[SPEAKER_00]: yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe you haven't talked about or
shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean as a grower, I've killed thousands
of plants I'll just throw that out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we learn a lot from our fit
our failures You know, I follow green life
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly closely but I may have missed it or
maybe it's not something you've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about but yeah, I'm just curious Yeah,
um not something I'll talk about a lot is
[SPEAKER_01]: a I filled a whole room once, you know 150
pounds with the weed down the drain It was
[SPEAKER_01]: my second cycle room three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was my sixth room flippin We took
some cuts in From from a patient and
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently they had p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a super healthy facility healthy
soil healthy plants And I just watched
[SPEAKER_01]: this PM just Wipe out just go through my
whole facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never had him at that time So I
didn't really know much about it coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from a home garden coming from a you know,
a Six light home garden into a 300 light
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facility It was kind of a
game-changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made I made a mistake last minute We
decided to to try a space and beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a bacillus types products on on the
plants hoping to counteract the PM I
[SPEAKER_01]: figured it's better to smoke beneficial
microbes and it would be p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was my kind of mindset early on But we
sprayed some some Some this that the other
[SPEAKER_01]: things I failed horribly my first test
hundred pounds of some of the best looking
[SPEAKER_01]: we've ever grown I shouldn't say that but
it's decent looking we better than most
[SPEAKER_01]: street weed Have had to throw it all the
way state came out film the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for I would say the whole third
and fourth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just chase in my tail trying to
control p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learned a lot about soil health and and
just overall how that particular pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: works Didn't use any crazy No crazy
fungicides or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we did was was natural I did
things like h2o2 to control it as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying leaf surfaces But for the most
part I learned how to how to write some
[SPEAKER_01]: new SOPs had a better my IPM has stepped
my game up going forward and I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen a spot of p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Over seven years in Yeah, so did you
have to make any environmental changes to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the powder mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we stepped their game up as far as
because at first we didn't know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem was so we were I mean shooting in
every direction, you know, we were Up to
[SPEAKER_01]: our dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We changed our our IPM regimen make sure
you know, everyone's dressed now this that
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing But ultimately just what
it would ultimately got me through it was
[SPEAKER_01]: I found strains That weren't affected by
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to call all the strains that were I
put my strains like pure sunshine a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people out there love pure sunshine from
us from the back of the day because I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of it and the reason I grew a lot of
it is because pure sunshine didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: powdered mildew so I put pure sunshine
into rotation and and and she was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold her own and then that got my that
gave me a chance for all my genetics in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg where I can you know spraying with
H202 and kind of keeping clean long enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to get past that virus or that pathogen
And then once once I would did that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go through and clean out my
facility Because your facility gets PM to
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people realize that
if you can You can tissue culture all you
[SPEAKER_01]: want and put the cleanest clones into the
sterile rooms or at least sterile mediums
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have a you know,
a clean facility, you just pushed a
[SPEAKER_01]: rock-up pill So yeah, we don't have your
facility not welcome those things And I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like our plans being that we did a
more natural process to get rid of PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one Of the reasons I ain't
seen PM in seven years It's like there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of biological intelligence had
those plans gained from that battle that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't erase with the Eagle 20 At least I
like to think so, but it was definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: dark time someone more stressed out times
my life Super glad to have gotten through
[SPEAKER_00]: it Yeah, that's that's a really cool story
and I appreciate you sharing it They've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually found the genetic and what some
genetic markers In the plant DNA for PM
[SPEAKER_01]: which you may have heard about which is
pretty cool Yeah, because eight seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago I sent samples of pure sunshine
to medicinal Geonomics to find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: that marker was and never got a call back
or email back Yeah, yeah and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different environment I'm guessing in
Nevada Then like someone like myself here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Pacific Northwest, which is a lot
And and I want to dive into that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think some of your practices are very
unique to your environment And they may
[SPEAKER_00]: not translate the same and I'm not saying
that that's wrong I'm just saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't think we can take all of your
tech all of your ideas and make and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them into You know an environment like
Florida or Washington or Maine and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and that that I think is a
really interesting conversation Is there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else on IPM that we should touch
on though while we're talking about it
[SPEAKER_01]: just like The environment is a big part
man, like a lot of the things I do you get
[SPEAKER_01]: people understand I live in a like a
pretty barren desert There's not a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of whole lot of natural pest pressure
Around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the hemp scene was huge out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are farms out here So it's not like
there's no pests but like you said I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: living in a place like Florida or Like
Northern, California like grass valley
[SPEAKER_01]: where everyone their mom is farming within
you know, two feet of each other So it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely limits the risks Quite a bit
and it's things I've had to consider when
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting or helping other farms in other
states It's it's something I had to just
[SPEAKER_01]: own and realize that yeah things that have
to be different That that brings up a good
[SPEAKER_00]: point you mentioned something in your talk
that I thought was really important and
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful You talked about the workers in
your facility and who gets into your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so and that was another Game-changer
on the p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing back to the p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day, so When I design my facility I was
kicking it with a Matt Davenport and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was going through his whole permaculture
Schools and stuff like that me and him
[SPEAKER_01]: were both feeding off each other And one
of the things that he was real big on at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time was designing a space to be like
a bullseye Like your highest traffic area
[SPEAKER_01]: being the bullseye your second highest
traffic area being that the next little
[SPEAKER_01]: live out and so on so forth and How you
want to try to put those the busier
[SPEAKER_01]: sections next to each other to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid the back-and-forth And so so in our
facility our busiest area is our office
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we kind of that's the home of
the facility is the office That's where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything kind of everybody kind of goes
back that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the bullseye And then from there
we have our trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the second busiest spot And then
from there we have our grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a third busiest spot And to get to
our grow room our growers can walk through
[SPEAKER_01]: our trim room, but our trimmers have never
been in our grow rooms There's no reason
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a need to Be basis if you
don't need to be back there you're not So
[SPEAKER_01]: example when you walk in everybody walks
into the office everybody gets dressed out
[SPEAKER_01]: into their clean scrubs And then everybody
goes to their stations the trimmers go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the trim room and then the growers go
further to the actual grill I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: separation and across all that because you
never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the biggest vectors I like to think
we have a rule at GOP that no one's
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to grow at home and we it's a hard
there's a big rule and I try to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: people with candidates and incentives like
that and But you never know if someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: being honest or not and they are going at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's a really big risk I can't
risk, you know 35 jobs for one person to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a plant at home that has spider mites
And then you know, I got sent 35 people
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something So we definitely try to make
sure no one grows at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's that's another big part
People only go where they need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a need that need to be place And then
we also have a room order and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: designed within the p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Days I enter my rooms in a certain order
depending on You know what's going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: different stages of life that the plants
are in them or if there's an issue in one
[SPEAKER_01]: room So I have three rooms and the first
thing my growers and I do every day We
[SPEAKER_01]: walk in as we go to our board and we look
at the room order, you know Might be one
[SPEAKER_01]: two three might be three two one But
whatever the case may be and we do not
[SPEAKER_01]: break that order example if I go to room
one and I have powdery mildew and then I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: walking around room one work in room one
and then I walk in the room to well now
[SPEAKER_01]: room two has powdery mildew and Same with
pets, you know pests or have different
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycles Different life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know if I get an early pest stage
in one room then I take that early pest
[SPEAKER_01]: into another room or vice versa now I'm
fighting the battles everywhere now
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting the soil stage of the pest I'm
fighting the above-ground stage of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pest I'm fighting it everywhere and this
gets more costly where by having a room
[SPEAKER_01]: order if I do get a pest at least I have
it in a certain area a certain state like
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's at its soil stage I can feed it
with nematodes or fight of nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: bossiana wherever the case may be But then
as it advances it starts to go before the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants now have different Strategies
different techniques to try to handle that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant But if I'm trying to all those
things at once it gives his costly and
[SPEAKER_01]: time-consuming so room order And again the
room where it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a perfect cycle You know,
sometimes when it runs perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of stays in order Unless a pest or
a disease shows itself in a certain area
[SPEAKER_00]: then we kind of work around it That's a
that's a really good explanation And I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's something that's universal
across all facilities a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM is is custom to a facility You there's
no perfect just IPM program that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: write that would work for every facility
and I think that's an important thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize but My buddy Justin describes it
in a way that really works for my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and like It's like a it's like a river
running down from the you know The
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the river all the way down to
the the mouth where it enters the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: and things only move in one direction So
you want to move from your areas of like
[SPEAKER_00]: least pest pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most important which is your mother
room your veg plants and then work your
[SPEAKER_00]: way down into your flower rooms all the
way through to harvest because if You have
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep it as far down the river
as possible is the way he describes it and
[SPEAKER_00]: and that Yeah, that that algae works for
me I like I like your bulls-eye idea too
[SPEAKER_00]: and and it's important to think about that
Like where is your foot traffic because we
[SPEAKER_00]: are huge vectors and then how do we
eliminate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned spraying hydrogen peroxide
is there anything else that you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: like Your spray regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that was only when we had p.m I
do my rooms on a breakdown when I clean my
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the things I will spray my
walls and things with like h202 Just
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just room breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I keep it off the plants I try to
keep as much off the plants as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to spray You obviously early
spring with things start warming up drip
[SPEAKER_01]: start showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bust out essential oils May add a
little bit mean to It that's about as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as we go For the most part it's compost
teas And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean and for the most part when I spray
I spray the floors So like when I'll mix
[SPEAKER_01]: up a strong neem or essential oil and I'll
bomb my floors with it Before I ever hit
[SPEAKER_01]: my plants with it It's a really huge
surface space a lot of things end up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the floor and we have a lot of really good
success spraying our floors Do you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: like come through and mop right after or
something because it's slippery Or yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually we'll do it at the end of the day
on like a Friday when no one's gonna be in
[SPEAKER_01]: there during the weekend To minimize ink
that but yes, then Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come in ice skating with a mop Okay,
okay Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one other question before we really
dive into it here Heavy metals you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned being an old lumber facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy in Oklahoma fail for arsenic
because they were doing construction on
[SPEAKER_00]: the building And it was literally knocking
arsenic down dust because the building had
[SPEAKER_00]: been a lumber yard a lumber treatment
facility like onto the plants and he
[SPEAKER_00]: failed for arsenic Has that been an issue
for you at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you and I have had conversations
offline Years ago way before heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: was even really such a hot topic How do
you how do you manage that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean, honestly, we've been super blessed
to never really have to never be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some Of the similar heavy metal
requirements as other states I see people
[SPEAKER_01]: with it's one of the hot that and
aspergillus I think are two of the hottest
[SPEAKER_01]: tickets right now Aspergillus testing but
we've been blessed with heavy metals as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as you know, never been an issue I I
can't really account to what it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on when we got our soil first tested
before plant-free in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were some Acceptable levels of
certain things and they've never They've
[SPEAKER_01]: never exceeded, you know, we've always
been any time I've seen any Like arsenic
[SPEAKER_01]: or any things like that even you know jump
up slightly and we backed off all ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: products No, no crustacean meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kelps things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean when we do use things like kelps or
crustacean You'll use them very sparingly
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be you know considerate of that
But I know it is an issue We've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it some of the things that could
help I knew I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bioremediation as far as some of the
mushrooms we use But we're not pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: them out all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might not be it I don't know we've
talked about Just a bunch of the thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't really say to be honest start with a
good soil make sure that it's biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: it's It is biologically active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plants are aren't basically Don't
bypass the soil food web, you know I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's a big thing is people bypass
the soil food web and then their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are forced to eat heavy metals in some
cases When my system my plants had
[SPEAKER_01]: everything they want through the soil food
web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for them to chew tin
cans But at the same time, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never been a problem for me I wish I
had an answer because it is a problem for
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people Get your soil through kiss
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be a problem again Well,
thanks for the shout out I've you just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't I'd use your soil to and I've never
had a problem with it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So For anybody out there who needs to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh you have really I I know we talked
about a big order at one point when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding but You found a you know a
closer resource and it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never we never expanded COVID hit we're
doing a big greenhouse thing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID hit so we kind of shut that whole
party off the time being But I ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: testing your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expanded our mother our bedroom I did a
mother bed and I put your soil in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother bed and then using that for Five
years now six years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now it's green life soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not kiss organic soil anymore right
on man You mentioned the soil food web and
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely want to talk about that
because we do have some slight differences
[SPEAKER_00]: of opinion there but You do Soil test,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and we have to jump back to
aspergillus at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to forget that Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me forget aspergillus because
the people are gonna give me a hard time
[SPEAKER_00]: if I don't bring it Yeah Shoot,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to it though You do soil
test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes So you you you're a soul food per web
person, but then you also do you believe
[SPEAKER_00]: in managing fertility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, what is the pH range of
your soils on on average?
[SPEAKER_01]: High like six eight to seven one on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do I I love that That's the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be in actually That's good to
hear How do you manage fertility then with
[SPEAKER_00]: these beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know in like you've already
pointed out I've gone through different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages in my career different techniques
and it's always been Involving early on
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know a whole lot what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just swinging for the fence that
everything just Trying a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: this a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was getting crazy Then then I had a
what's-his-name Scott scanners and scams
[SPEAKER_01]: and like that Came out of here and
reintroduced me to the soil food web and
[SPEAKER_01]: aligning gum I got signed up to the whole
soil food web course went through that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole stage And then I went hardcore soil
food web like biology driven compost only
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran it like I'm talking hardcore no
amendments any Thing just like all
[SPEAKER_01]: biological just whatever my plants the way
we didn't use went back to the soil I did
[SPEAKER_01]: that for about a little over a year and
then Then when we switched our lights of
[SPEAKER_01]: those lights, I fell on my face We had the
best harvest ever the first harvest and
[SPEAKER_01]: then then the soil couldn't keep up after
that No matter how many compost teas I did
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how much biological inputs
whatever it just couldn't keep up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to go back to the soil testing
and kind of looking at my soil and Logan
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs, I work with soil doctor Bryant quite
a bit awesome, dude But then we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that yeah, there's you gotta you
gotta put back what you take out You can't
[SPEAKER_01]: just take out, you know can't be cropping
out 200 pounds of room every month and
[SPEAKER_01]: expected You know just to come from thin
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like there's a combination
between soil testing and soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: type techniques We put them both together
get the best of both worlds make it super
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient for your for your microbes to do
their job give me everything they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: Do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I test my soil two or three times a
year My saturated pace test is is usually
[SPEAKER_01]: where I have to do my work on because
we're primarily, you know Feed the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my standard test is always I almost ace
that thing every time But it's a sand is
[SPEAKER_01]: the saturated pace test where the work is
found But yeah, just over time you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to see these trends kind of form
Everything that we've ever done in GOP I
[SPEAKER_01]: try I track on a board at the end of every
week that board gets recorded into a
[SPEAKER_01]: notebook onto a Way call yeah,
no notebook deal and have eight years of
[SPEAKER_01]: data literally every single thing that's
going into my soil every single
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement and amount for eight years has
been recorded and You can start to see
[SPEAKER_01]: these trends when you start to look at you
know What you did that cycle and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: three rooms that I keep about a month
apart So I run the same exact SOPs for a
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle even if it even if I trip on the
First room I'm gonna repeat the second and
[SPEAKER_01]: third room to keep the rooms consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds crazy But it's just I
can't taste too many different problems
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place So we repeat the same
thing every cycle And then when I test my
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, I see the first room that there's
finished a cycle I see the room that's
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the cycle and I see there was a
beginning the cycle I get a full picture
[SPEAKER_01]: of what my soil looks like based off of
that cycles SOPs And then from there we
[SPEAKER_01]: can start to track trends I can see you
know what's going up and what's going down
[SPEAKER_01]: faster than I can fix it and we start To
kind of design our what we need to top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress what we need to put back into the
soil going into that next cycle Now my top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress that that's a really big one I think
you heard me talk about it for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time with that's that talk in California
recently But the way we run our systems is
[SPEAKER_01]: my replant a room I have about three weeks
before I flip the flower so about four
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks before the flower shows up So I have
about four weeks of top dressing To get my
[SPEAKER_01]: soil back to where I needed to be and it's
not even for that cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the next cycle, honestly So I'll
go into a room that every week we do a
[SPEAKER_01]: light top dressing and how I measure my
top dressing is based off an old technique
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from Lane Ingham's first on
course where there was a lady talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about worm farming and She had mentioned
that you don't want to feed your worm farm
[SPEAKER_01]: more than your worms could be in three
days because then you know if a Say fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: net comes in lays an egg that egg has you
know hatches in two to three days Then it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to nest life cycle and so on so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you only feed your worms what they
can eat In three days, it's an eat
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever food source that lake just guys
that fly just lays egg in isn't getting
[SPEAKER_01]: eaten It's a passive that it just the
system of the worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna make it out So it's gonna
keep the pest pressure down as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: flies and things of that nature go So with
that being said when I top dress my soil
[SPEAKER_01]: when I feed my soil, I only top dress what
my soil what my worms Could eat or shred
[SPEAKER_01]: in three to five days in one week So if I
come in that if I come in on Monday and I
[SPEAKER_01]: top dress my beds usually it's about two
cups on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about two cups of whatever Part mix
we want to do if it's nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously like a soybean meal or an
alfalfa and Fill in the blanks for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll mix there are two part three part
mix I'll put about two cups of bed on
[SPEAKER_01]: average is where our beds can take what
they how big how big are your beds eight
[SPEAKER_01]: by four Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay So so and we do that every the
beginning of the week now if I come in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next week And I still see the top dressing
from the prior week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm either gonna wait a little bit longer
I'm a back off my amounts and I'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you know the Worms and the
roly-poly whatever critters you have
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling around are shredding and working
it into the soil You don't want to leave a
[SPEAKER_01]: food source for pest to lay its eggs and
make it head next to the stage So that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a big product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just we come in every week We do a
light top dressing based off a top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing mix that we designed that's
always changing based off our Logan lab
[SPEAKER_01]: soil resorts where we're just kind of
tracking those trends and what we find for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part is Potassium is a hard one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always kind of trying to catch up
with potassium and then obviously nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine is is one that we're trying to
constantly trying to find the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want too little You don't want
too much either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of tricky Yeah, and those are
the two most mobile nutrients besides
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that makes sense and I see the
same thing How do you top dress with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing some photos where at certain
times and we should talk about this you
[SPEAKER_00]: have Quite a bit of cover crops in there
and biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you top dressing a bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first come into a room,
I chop and drop all my cover crops I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: remove anything as far as cover crop goes,
but I said I said a clean slate God forbid
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pest pressure the last room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need things lingering in my cover
crops So we reset the room completely
[SPEAKER_01]: early on and we top drop top dress from
there So I'm not really top dressing on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of heavy cover crops typically and
then we water it in so it's dry amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't you know, typically aren't
really available to the plant Trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed the soil not pat, you know soil food
web paradigm anyways So the whole idea is
[SPEAKER_01]: yet Chop and drop early get the cover
crops knocked down and it's right and
[SPEAKER_01]: started making your soil slowly But surely
if you do have cover crops we water it in
[SPEAKER_01]: I do I and I know we this is another topic
We're gonna go raise the cover crops one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if this is the starting
point for that Well, we haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten into soul food web yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's save cover crops Because I
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear your thoughts on that I've
done this regarding the soul food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, my dad was one of the first
soul food web advisors big compost tea in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact our company was founded on being the
first company to have Like a it's Lane
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham certified 12-hour compost tea five
gallon brewer so that's that's where we
[SPEAKER_00]: started in the industry when I came into
everything and In more recent years and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's and when I say in more recent
years, you know, we're I'm old now this
[SPEAKER_00]: was like we started this in 1999 maybe
it's been over 20 years In more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: years some of the claims from the soul web
Community and some of the things that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned don't always align and I'd love to
hear your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard dr. Ingham say that all
soils have sufficient minerals for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth In my experience when we manage
fertility sort of like you are we get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better outcome then just relying on
microbes to make new Nutrients available
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be in sufficient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe soul food web can fully it
can buffer things I don't believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: corrects pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it corrects a calcium
deficiency or nitrogen or what some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of mineral issue or toxicity Why don't why
don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think yeah, I can only speak from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm new to outdoor farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think it takes time for the biology to
do its job To make certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: available and I know like a cannabis
facility time is money I'm turning these
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms over, you know four times a year So
I don't really allow a lot of time needed
[SPEAKER_01]: for these biological processes To mine
these minerals and all these things to
[SPEAKER_01]: take place So I do think they're
especially and when you try to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: business I do see the advantage of being
able to to give your soil what it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: your your microbial community what it
needs that If if I give you, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium then you have to you know dig a
mile in the earth's surface to find it
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a lot more efficient way for
the plant to get it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think there's there's definitely some
pros and cons there I again, like I said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier I went hard course for a food web
with some really powerful lights and the
[SPEAKER_01]: food web indoors and I'm talking the best
compost 100% good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's nothing nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No crazy techniques It couldn't keep up
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm prompt it on engineered soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could not keep up I had to resort to
feeding my soil I had a resort to putting
[SPEAKER_01]: those minerals back in and I've heard the
story if you have rocks in your soil You
[SPEAKER_01]: have minerals and nutrients to take it
takes to grow plants I just I just think
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes a little more time for the
biology to make those biology Available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant than a lot of us allow Cool and
on that topic of soil Food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I've also heard It's said that
if you have a pest problem That that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because you didn't have the right soil
food web in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have the right, you know
Bacteria and fungal and fungi and and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal to bacteria ratios to keep that
pest from becoming successful at consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant Yeah, if you have a good F3
ratio and high brisk pest don't exist
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sarcasm Okay, I mean I know people
believe that I I don't I Disagree,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they might help obviously a
healthy plant is then defend itself better
[SPEAKER_01]: a healthy person with a good immune system
is then defend itself better But not then
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate the risk completely So no,
I don't really subscribe to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really obviously I've witnessed
unhealthy soils with more press pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: and healthy soils with less pressure,
but I've never seen Like I heard people
[SPEAKER_01]: say if you have a pest I use like a trap
trap plants and banker plant type
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques Well, I heard people tell me
I'll just put a sick plant like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: center of your room and all your best
pests will go to that sick plant then you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just remove the sick plant and I get
people on my page telling me this all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time these 100 people told me this it's
not the case Yes, it will help to have
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soils, obviously, but it's not
gonna all all cure all for sure Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I I agree with you on that like I
think if you're Pest pressure is
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have pest damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're ecologically and
evolutionarily designed to do is consume
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, so Yeah, there's just some
things that I've struggled with that if
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard coming out of the soul food web
community And that's not to say it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: directly or anything like that But there
are some philosophical differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing on the soul food web topic
is this idea of fungal to bacteria ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: so when I went to the I mentioned this to
you before when I went to the The Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Society of America SSSA conference
the international one actually it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego one year I heard I saw some
excellent research on fungal to bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and essentially it boiled down to
this Fungal to bacteria ratios are
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly changing in the soil They can
measure them and they can measure what
[SPEAKER_00]: species of microbes you you know in
various microbes you have in your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but things like a rain event like
hydrology or temperature Disturbance all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things will impact your fungal to
bacteria ratios Not on like a cycle basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually in terms of like a growing
cycle, but literally on an hourly basis So
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see I mean these microbes live
lifetimes Of evolution just within one
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of your of your of your grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we make decisions based off of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that that ratio is constantly
going to be in flux Yeah, I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest and I love Elaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love like So thankful for the work she's
done and with the regulatory systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going through now as far as from the
battles I see why she does some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things she does and says some of the
things she does makes more sense to me now
[SPEAKER_01]: overall as far as like the F2B subject
goes I Quit chasing that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like every soil in the world could
use more fungus and I feel like it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: a kind of a It's like a point where I go a
consultant can really sell you some
[SPEAKER_01]: high-quality compost that you may not need
as much as you think Hey, you need fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: and more fungus in your soil Well,
I just happen to have this fungal dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: compost you could buy for a thousand
dollars a yard So I don't really subscribe
[SPEAKER_01]: to that no more And I only say that
because I'm working with an engineered
[SPEAKER_01]: soil indoors that the primary plant that's
been grown in this soil for the last eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years is Cannabis now for eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've added compost that is fungal dominant
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the best compost in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to countless microbes by our
catalyst by amendments And I still grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial dominant soil whenever I scoop
my soil make an assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's without a doubt bacterially dominant
That's not to say I don't have mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say I don't have Beneficial
fungus in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to me like this plant which
is in control It prefers to grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial diamond soil and like you see To
point to both things you said Both the
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle of the plant has something to
do with that I feel like the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually dates and how it's cycling
It is and I also control that have played
[SPEAKER_01]: a big role in that then also watering
cycle I could I could jack up my watering
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle miss a watering cycle over water
underwater where the case may be and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not create a huge flux in the
microbial community too, so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of variables that go into
play now as far as the F2B ratio on on on
[SPEAKER_01]: like certain plants I do believe like I
hear some people say that like Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Lohenfeld's that when I read his book and
he's real big on Ecological succession and
[SPEAKER_01]: he kind of like place cannabis like kind
of like in the middle more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial side And then you have people on
like the soil food web side They're like
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil food web consultants are like no
it needs to be on the fungal side more
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus if you have this fungus You won't
have any pests and disease and your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will flourish and they'll produce CBD that
never produced CBD before I've heard that
[SPEAKER_01]: one They'll say all these crazy things I
disagree I'm more with Jeff Lohenfeld's
[SPEAKER_01]: dude and based off of what I've seen on a
soil that's been grown that's been grown
[SPEAKER_01]: by cannabis for eight years Every time I
look at it's bacterial dominated,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not only that but anytime I put a
plant to my soil it flourishes except two
[SPEAKER_01]: times I put a Redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry Sequoia trees in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a Sequoia trees both times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fell flat on their face different
type of nutrients Different type of
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever different type of soil,
but it just showed me kind of like back to
[SPEAKER_01]: like what Jeff Lohenfeld said the
ecological succession It kind of showed me
[SPEAKER_01]: where my cannabis plant is in the soil
that is growing And it's and I get
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly quoted as an old-growth forest
old-growth forest But I'm my soil isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like an old-growth forest it may look like
it at certain times But when you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: it under the microscope Drastically
different I assure you So I don't know I
[SPEAKER_01]: have mixed opinions on I'm still learning
my you asked me in ten years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably have a better Opinion on it,
but it's not something I chase my tail
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be ratio I try to always be
conscious of making sure there's good
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus in there beneficial fungus in there
I'm more worried about nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: and the amount of water I put in you know,
you dry your soil out too much Nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling is gonna fall on its face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to time your watering events
I think is really key to maintaining a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil system But yeah, that that's
my thing I lost a lot of friends in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web community saying shit like
that, but is what it is No, I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think you said something I think we
kind of aligned pretty closely on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: actually I know we were further off in the
past but And I wonder if your Sequoia
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just can't handle that level of
fertility too that you're putting in for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis Where I fell on my flat on my
face was with blueberries I threw some
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries in my veggie mix and they just
did not grow Well, my pH was way too high
[SPEAKER_00]: for blueberries at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know live and learn like you said
But some of the things that you said that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are really interesting that I want
to highlight is one we're always learning
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always you know, a good grower I
think is really open-minded to changing
[SPEAKER_00]: their practices as they learn new things
and I'm constantly learning new things I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a much better grower than I was two years
ago versus five years ago in a decade ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and also that Yeah, if we can always keep
in mind that the soul food web is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say That it doesn't matter
but I think that the way that I choose
[SPEAKER_00]: personally to manage it is through like
like you said this concept of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling being important and thinking of is
like how can I keep my nutrient cycling up
[SPEAKER_00]: but also What practices do I have that
just encourage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy diverse microbial activity in my
soil because I'm gonna do those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you mentioned compost you
mentioned potentially compost tea You
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned added adding minerals all of
those things are gonna feed microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: then when we do that, I think we get a
better outcome like you said, so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're really that far off on
that one Yeah, so okay well let's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't forget let's jump backwards to
aspergillus and then let's dive into cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops so Aspergillus talk to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your experiences?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's something we all need to get on
the same page about and start getting out
[SPEAKER_01]: there more About it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not designed to help
organic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's designed to help
anybody in the industry at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Definitely think it's a huge roadblock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody Especially outside
the campus community since they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: testing for aspergillus ever talked about
aspergilliosis or any type of Disease
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one talks about it No one's ever
concerned about it until cannabis came
[SPEAKER_01]: into legal campus came into the scene If
you were to go to the grocery store and
[SPEAKER_01]: test your food you wanted fail for every
pesticide and fungus on the planet And
[SPEAKER_01]: then to yeah, it's gonna have aspergillus
and mold and yeast all over it because
[SPEAKER_01]: these naturally occurring molds and yeast
and and funguses are everywhere so To me,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's kind of a silly thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I feel like it's a it's a
bigger problem kind of like what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: facing nowadays as far as I think it's
It's more of a political issue I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: people are lobbying for things like
aspergillus for their own reasons that are
[SPEAKER_01]: not for the benefit of this plant or this
industry or organic growers in general
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically what I feel like I feel
like it shouldn't be long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't belong If they are in the
assist on testing for aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to at least put a count on it
Not a pass or fail live or dead And then
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I feel like it just needs to be more
understood I feel like there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistencies what labs that example I
can send ten lots out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say for fun Two of them fail
for aspergillus and that's the only thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I ever fail for when I do fail a test
it'll fail for Aspergillus here in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's inconsistent all again ten lots
of the same strain growing the same room
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time two of them will pop off
aspergillus I'll ask for a retest but
[SPEAKER_01]: based off the other eight they'll give me
a they'll prove a retest and those two
[SPEAKER_01]: pass the next lab So there's not even a
consistency on the lab side Whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: essays are using to determine if it has
aspergillus or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just super It's super frustrating
from my side's perspective because a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example is a or a Good data is valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So if you have good data is
valuable, but bad data is very costly We
[SPEAKER_01]: put a lot of responsibility on these labs
and we'd like to think that they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: the word of God that they're perfect But
they're run by humans and they make
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes too So I feel like the
aspergillus testing needs to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent these make more sense And or
just need to go away I think people need
[SPEAKER_01]: to quit arguing with each other online and
then I think we all need to kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: together maybe pay some lobbyists pay some
some people who can write some things into
[SPEAKER_01]: law and start getting this things taken
off the docket because That's the only way
[SPEAKER_01]: people ask me all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I help aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I stop that feeling faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do to pass for aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to stop testing for aspergillus if
you want to be profitable It is
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently or as much as possible Now as
far as aspergillus some of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: have learned that can help people One
cover crops, okay cover crops Barrier over
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I think of like a clone dome
and a dome on the clone dome So they kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of cover your soil to keep it from gassing
off from spore leading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a perfect science It's not that
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep everything in but it keeps up down
and I say that because Really based off
[SPEAKER_01]: this last month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem for the eighth time every time this
time of year I tend to pop hot
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally and this is the time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut my cover cost back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about this every spring I come to
cover cause black back to minute to
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize any potential pet Pest pressure
getting in but when I cut my cover crop
[SPEAKER_01]: back every time This year my fail rates go
up The things like aspergillus I highly
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that your cover crops are then I
kind of do what they're supposed to do
[SPEAKER_01]: They then create that mulch while those
living organisms can be sheltered and live
[SPEAKER_01]: happily not blow up all over the place Now
Steve, you're you're you're a hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this because we've talked about it
Do you think that the cover crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely pros to cover crops
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna get into that But do you
think the cover crop helps eliminate some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the splashing caused?
[SPEAKER_00]: by hand watering that might kick up more
dust or kick up more Aspergillus onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean potentially like you think
about just like erosion It's gonna help
[SPEAKER_01]: protect from I mean erosion indoor
erosion, I guess so it's gonna help
[SPEAKER_01]: protect the soil of the surface But the
other thing is is being just good cleanly
[SPEAKER_01]: practices like we dress out I have I have
everyone sealed rooms with with with heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: filtration I Make sure every break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean my rooms from top to bottom
There's and then they're strange you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's pass or fail For a live or
dead or whatever it's pass or fail if you
[SPEAKER_01]: get caught with it, but you understand
There's certain strains that won't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain strains with certain
turpentine profiles that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-fungal that through years of data
that we have little to Almost no fails for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain chains anything with the limonene
dominant profile is gonna be your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far less likely to have failed for
molding yeast and or Aspergillus Boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it Alright guys, you heard it
here first before these labs come out with
[SPEAKER_00]: the data to support this marker Steve just
listed it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll throw that out there It's one of
the things that we look for when I do an
[SPEAKER_01]: Athena hunt if I see limonene in the top
three turpines I know I have a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: probability of that strain get making it
to market again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bulletproof But I could show you
years of data like example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss X.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's leads in limonene She has zero
almost like no fails compared to something
[SPEAKER_01]: like our lavender That doesn't have any
limonene in it that I can't even grow no
[SPEAKER_01]: more because I can't pass a more release
test for it so That's really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love that you change out your
cultivars based on how they perform from
[SPEAKER_00]: an IPM perspective because I think a lot
of people chase these like high strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and We'll keep growing them even though
they don't have the environment to really
[SPEAKER_01]: Successfully grow it so it cost me it cost
me a lot of money to to learn those things
[SPEAKER_01]: I show you I did I tried growing lavender
for years before I realized it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: safest training for indoor, you know
microbial tested products Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do hear that there are some I mean
what you listed were some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practices for Reducing
Aspergillus because it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere if you're using compost you're
going to have if you don't have A sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: media you're gonna have Aspergillus pretty
much So it's just about keeping it off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf surface and keeping the levels
low enough that it's not it's not causing
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem And you listed a lot of really
great practices for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just add there are certain products
I believe like trichoderm certain
[SPEAKER_00]: trichodermas like root shield they can
help with this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option for folks that
are dealing with it as a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I was talking with dr. Michael
Brownbridge who I've had on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and He we had a separate email chain where
he was listing some a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you said just some good cultural practices
and then what products can we use to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially lower it in our in our in our
room, so Another one is looking at like
[SPEAKER_01]: food look at the food industry like a lot
of the regulations that we face is based
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the food industry it's been going
on a lot longer than cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: has and A lot of the things that keeps
food fresh and keeps food from spoiling
[SPEAKER_01]: and will also keep a cannabis from
spoiling So cold temperatures at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: time is also really key That
[SPEAKER_00]: was Steve Cantwell and you are listening
to the cannabis cultivation and science
