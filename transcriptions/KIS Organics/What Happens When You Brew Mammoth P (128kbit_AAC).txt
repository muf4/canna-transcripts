[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Tad Hussie with KISS Organics
and I'm here today to take a look under
[SPEAKER_00]: the microscope at mammoth pee and see if
there are ways that we might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and replicate some of these
microorganisms just to make the mammoth
[SPEAKER_00]: pee go a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're here with mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is directly out of a sample bottle
that I received.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottle I've had for at least a few
months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been sitting in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at 400 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a phase contrast microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's actually a fair bit of
active motile bacteria running around and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm guessing is a little piece of
alfalfa since I know they use alfalfa in
[SPEAKER_00]: their process up in the upper right hand
corner of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to attempt to do today
is in distilled water mix in micro pee
[SPEAKER_00]: with a few different ingredients and see
if we can't replicate some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms to make our mammoth pee just go
a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 12 hours later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mammoth pee again with nothing
but distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after 12 hours you can see we have what
appears to be more active microbes even
[SPEAKER_00]: without a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll go on to check and see how
different food sources affected these
[SPEAKER_00]: different microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the mammoth pee again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I've added a small amount of
unsulfured blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see quite a bit more activity
with the added food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much the whole slide looks about
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the microbe catalyst added to the
mammoth pee at around 16 hours in and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll notice you have quite the same
levels of bacterial growth as we had using
[SPEAKER_00]: the molasses but what you do see is a much
greater diversity of microorganisms which
[SPEAKER_00]: is really what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't guarantee that that molasses is
growing out all of the pee solubilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that mammoth pee is adding into
the mix and while we can't do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: with the microbe catalyst, at least not
with just direct microscopy, we are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to at least determine that the there is a
much greater diversity in morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at this sample which I find
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the alfalfa at 16 hours with
the mammoth pee in distilled water and as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see there's pretty good bacterial
growth again more than the control and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pee is to be a little bit more
morphological diversity than we saw with
[SPEAKER_00]: the molasses but not quite as much growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if alfalfa is a little
better food source especially considering
[SPEAKER_00]: they use alfalfa as part of their process,
manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm wondering if I can up the amount of
microbe catalyst that I used as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a little bit more bacterial growth
while still maintaining that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind too that this test is not
completely conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't determine exactly which
microorganisms from the micro pee are
[SPEAKER_00]: being replicated and if we're losing any
in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step would be to do some plant
trials to determine what sorts of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: response we get from a mixture like this
that's been brewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is just mammoth pee and
distilled water at 28 hours no food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see we're getting quite a bit
of motile bacteria not as much biomass as
[SPEAKER_00]: the other slides but possibly a little bit
better morphological diversity which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense assuming that all these
microorganisms or these different
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial species are in mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it speaks to the quality of the
product in regards to there being a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: good biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular sample that I pulled was
from a sample bottle that I've had for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least four months just sitting on a shelf
in normal room temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by comparison here's the mammoth pee
with the molasses and distilled water at
[SPEAKER_00]: 28 hours and as you can see there's quite
a bit of bacterial biomass but it appears
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't have the same level of
diversity that we were getting by feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: it a more diversified food source like the
microbe catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do appear to be feeding at least
one species of bacteria that seems pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty much what most of the
slide look like though you'll have just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few pockets of that really high density
that we saw right at the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here's the mammoth pee in distilled
water with organic alfalfa meal at 28
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see we do have good bacterial
growth and maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity than we're seeing compared to
the molasses not as much as with the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe catalyst but a little bit more
motile bacteria not as much biomass as the
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses was creating but maybe a little
bit better morphological diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay we're back with the mammoth pee in
distilled water with the microbe catalyst
[SPEAKER_00]: at around 28 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot more bacterial biomass
and a lot of it is as you can see starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to cluster around certain parts of the
microbe catalyst some of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this appears to be a pretty good food
source option for at least some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria bacterial species that are in the
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing some morphological diversity
but maybe not quite as much as we had in
[SPEAKER_00]: the original sample which made me leave me
to believe that not all of the various pea
[SPEAKER_00]: solubilizing species of bacteria are being
are being multiplied but I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely is worth a shot and I think
this is a great way to possibly extend
[SPEAKER_00]: your mammoth pee a little bit further.
Thank you.
you
