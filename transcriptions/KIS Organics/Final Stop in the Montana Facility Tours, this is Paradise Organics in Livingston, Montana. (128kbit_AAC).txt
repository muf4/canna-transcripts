[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Cleo Toll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the head guard for Paradise Organics
and we are going to be welcoming Tad
[SPEAKER_01]: Hussey into our farm to do a little walk
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a small scale organic cannabis farm
out of Livingston, Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We currently are growing in the Kiss
Organics commercial mix in our living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: beds and we make our own soil through just
recycling, building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Brandon
at the Kiss Organics team and everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: else at the Kiss Organics team for being
very approachable and helping me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we are a small scale farm and we
got Tad Hussey coming in and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a little walk through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different flower rooms do you
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got six flower rooms.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three bedrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys just kind of retrofitted it
to this.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our little clone area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area works really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it really good and humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the periodic table of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's really anything that
we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameron, the kid that I was showing you,
he's very, very good with keeping all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our clones clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very meticulous with the cleaning
process with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets everything sparkling clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just how his attention to detail is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's the clone man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some new seeds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ones are just getting munched by
thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips are the one thing that I've been
having a hard time getting rid of,
[SPEAKER_01]: as everyone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some new seeds, some new genetics,
some CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we are required by law to tag
our plants when they get to 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gotten ticketed for having them
not tagged at like 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just tagged basically everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the tags in the dirt for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plant gets a little stronger,
I'll put them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to clean these up pretty like
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I've kind of done is I've
let the plants go a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_01]: before hacking into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it's done better,
both for HLV spread and just the vigor of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I was saying, we are currently
growing too many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got four to 500 plants in flower
at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 1600 in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these ones, the ones with a little
discolor, we just get kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're constantly keeping up with
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just transplanting, transplanting,
transplanting, transplanting all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that you see that are a
little yellow here, they're just one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultivars that gets hungry faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're something that the
blueberry silvertip, it's really great
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but some cultivars just get hungry
or faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see, we got the dog punch here
that looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a bigger plant than these,
but these things are probably going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted in the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, we will go to bug room one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're not topping the plants or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I top the plants for only certain
cultivars when I need to, but usually if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting to a point where there's
so much of a Christmas tree, I'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to low stress train them
and give them a little bend before I top
[SPEAKER_01]: them just because I'm scared of spreading
HLV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stan, this is Tad, Tad, Stan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were saying that you were,
you were able to control the HLV a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit better by hands pruning rather than
pinching, rather than using the scissors
[SPEAKER_02]: that worked for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had data to back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've, cause we do, I try to test
about 10 plants through Toomey genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: every month or two, just to keep an eye on
how much HLV we have and we're spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I've stopped cleaning up all the
bottoms of my veg plants as fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: and since I've stopped topping these
plants with scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen less HLV and I've had less HLV
and I've got the data to back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's like, and I know some
growers will cleaning your scissors in
[SPEAKER_02]: between plant cuts and things like that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, I've had to ride my guys hard on
it cause it's a pain in the ass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is so important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a room that we just loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a, this is, you're, you're going
to see rooms with both HPS and LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do right now is I just,
I put blue lights down the middle for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first couple of weeks that really,
I mean, the plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed and a little upset initially
right off the bat, but that white light
[SPEAKER_01]: helps him quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the room that I've had my
aspergillus fail in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we have different opinions
about our cover crop inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand why, especially after
having the ice the pods, but it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle that I did not have cover crop in
here was when I failed for aspergillus,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I forgot to mention yesterday,
but listening to the pod with Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: Campbell, pretty sure your podcast,
he said something about like more cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, less aspergillus, which was it's
something where it's like, maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a strange deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a room where we have mainly all
LEDs, but I have these HPS in kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once these plants really develop,
and settle into flower, I'll turn those
[SPEAKER_01]: HPSs on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are orange lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I turn them on right off the bat,
it really kind of stresses the plants out
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look not very happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your, what's your target,
like PPFD on canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my target PPFD on the canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to, well, these, these LEDs,
I think you can have them a couple,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a foot and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to not have more than Mike,
like 4, 1,100 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micromoles, I think is that comparable to
PPFD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I was kind of thinking
about doing was removing the first little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of these root balls, which I don't do
yet, but I haven't had aspergillus fails
[SPEAKER_01]: in this room or anything of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, this is all Kiss Organics
commercial mix soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see, we do finally
defoliate our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did finally, and this is kind of how
we try to get them all stacked up nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did just water in here,
so there's water on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and I need to lower the lights
and bud too a little bit, because you see
[SPEAKER_01]: here, these lights are a little bit lower,
closer to these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this has been one of our,
one of our best rooms with the old Kiss
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics commercial mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, how many days in the flower are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the sheet, I'll tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start date, 8-22.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are one month, five days in the
flower.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our mother area, try to just store
genetics back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I've done, we spray this
room every three or four days with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen peroxide mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only 40 to 60 mils in a 7,000 mil
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very small and a little bit of pro
tech too, which is just a silica mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing silica mix sprays,
but that's kept powdery mildew and every
[SPEAKER_01]: pest out of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it was something that I've
struggled with for years and years of
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying, stuff oil, neem oil,
peppermint, Tweetman, Turvia oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I cannot get rid of these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I never really understood or I
never really liked it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like a bad chemical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I really learned and looked into
it, it's just liquid oxygen and it's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I'm very happy with the results that
that gives me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't leave a residue on the leaf
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long does it take you to get your
plants to this size?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're what, about five feet tall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we write down the transplant dates on
the, on the piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one was seven 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it got put into a one gallon pot
and then nine four, it got put into this
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two months ago, this plant was tiny,
just, just out of the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously some cultivars take longer than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like to have the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you feeding them any other nutrients
besides what's in the soil already,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're putting in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have a book of compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, uh, depending on the cultivar,
sometimes I'll know cultivars eat a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more and I'll give them a little top
dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but these are teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, just a bunch of recipes that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our favorites,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hippie hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see our homemade tea tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, uh, I used to have a 250
gallon one, but I, I feel like the one 20
[SPEAKER_01]: just works a little better for us right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our boards kind of like everything on the
walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, if there's no water in a room,
we got no water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it got sprayed, harvested, loaded
everything, I just try to, cause having
[SPEAKER_01]: information available for everyone is
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that there's the lack of
communication doesn't happen as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Oh, what do you mean you
watered that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just watered that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't happen when we have a board
telling exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that it gets done,
whether it's water, pruning, top dress,
[SPEAKER_01]: we write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in here, we're writing it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the inspector loves this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I print out every sheet of where it is,
the phase date, everything in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do get inspected, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's right where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I end up having a problem or it was a
really good run, I can go back and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what did I do differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also is I have the last couple of
years of everything that we've done and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can match it up to test results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really helps me kind of follow
scientific method of control, like taking
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing out and putting one thing back
in and actually seeing the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: From all of us here at Paradise Organics,
we'd like to give a huge thank you to Tad,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hussey and the whole team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tom, that's some good weed growing
right there.
Thank you.
