[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys so I want to share something new
we've been working on in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with a grower who is in
a very tight state for standards and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been independently testing a ton
of inputs not just from our company but
[SPEAKER_00]: from other providers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only here to share the results from
the ones from all the products that we
[SPEAKER_00]: carry but really important to try and get
test results and keep in mind too with
[SPEAKER_00]: these test results they're gonna vary a
little bit so this is gonna give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: rough idea of what's in the product but
this type of test that they're running
[SPEAKER_00]: here is an ICPMS test it's a very accurate
way of finding out exactly what's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: product you can see here like with arsenic
it's in the parts per billion is how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're reporting it and in parts per
million so 0.111 parts per million is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite low that's a very good number to see
and you can see here on the lead 0.311 so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pretty clean product from a heavy
metal perspective which is great and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have this for every product but for
all the products we do have you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: go on our website right now and check it
out and see what those numbers look like
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can better manage your heavy metals
keep in mind that pretty much every
[SPEAKER_00]: product is going to have some level of
heavy metals some are gonna be higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: others so you can absolutely make a better
choice in regards to certain things like
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust or soft rock phosphate for
example by choosing the one that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be lower in heavy metals same with gypsum
we actually have two different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum we're gonna be updating our page
with both a granulated and a powder gypsum
[SPEAKER_00]: from two different companies with two
different heavy metal tests and you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to go over here and select which one
you want so yeah I hope that folks find
[SPEAKER_00]: this helpful and one other thing I want to
point out while I'm doing this is so we
[SPEAKER_00]: got these tests originally from Delta
Urban Soils Lab they're an XRF test
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very affordable way of testing but
one thing to look at here is this
[SPEAKER_00]: detection limit you can see here it has
arsenic at 7 for example that means if
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic is below 7 ppm on these worm
castings it's going to give us a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than detection limit or no result here 7
is pretty high though for what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and so like I just got a recent test and
we'll add this to the website too you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here that the actual castings arsenic
levels were 2.4 using ICPMS which again is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a much more accurate way of
testing so just something to be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking on our test always be
sure to check or any test really be sure
[SPEAKER_00]: to check what the detection limits are on
the product or on the testing to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can actually test it to the
levels you want and while we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about heavy metals I just want to mention
with water you need very very good
[SPEAKER_00]: detection limits because a lot of times
the water tests are not detected to the
[SPEAKER_00]: level that we need them to in a commercial
facility to make sure that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in arsenic or lead or cadmium or
something like that in our water supply so
[SPEAKER_00]: hope folks find this helpful it's a free
resource it's on our website and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we list the brands for a lot of these
products like right here it'll say cascade
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals basalt so if you can find this
product locally you'll have up-to-date
[SPEAKER_00]: independent heavy metals test to go along
with it alright thanks guys
