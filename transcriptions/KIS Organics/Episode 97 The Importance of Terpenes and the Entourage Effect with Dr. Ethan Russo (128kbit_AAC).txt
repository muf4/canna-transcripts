[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Russo is a board-certified
neurologist, psychopharmacology
[SPEAKER_02]: researcher, and author.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the founder and CEO of CredoScience
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: He graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts Medical School before
residencies and pediatrics in Phoenix,
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona, and in Child and Adult Neurology
at the University of Washington in Seattle
[SPEAKER_02]: in a practice with a strong chronic pain
component.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1995, he pursued a three-month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Machiguena people in Parque
Nacional de Manu, Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_02]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as a visiting professor
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Harvard University, and John Hopkins
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has also published numerous book
chapters and over 50 articles in
[SPEAKER_02]: neurology, pain management, cannabis,
and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: His research interests have included
correlations of historical uses of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to modern pharmacological
mechanisms, phyto-pharmaceutical treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: of migraine and chronic pain, herbal
synergy and phyto-cannabinoid terpenoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonergic, and vanilla interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has consulted or lectured on these
topics in 39 US states and Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: provinces and 39 countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you some questions
regarding some of your more recent
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've done some work with Jeremy
Plum, who was recently on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought maybe we could start off talking
a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to explain some of the
methodology and what you were looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish with Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were doing was testing out a
novel solventless extraction technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea being to try and preserve
cannabinoid and particularly terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: content of fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should point out that the source
article is open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available online at ethanrusso.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people just hit the library tab,
it'll be about the second article down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called novel solventless
extraction technique to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles of
fresh cannabis in fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was doing was operating under the
feeling that the standard way of
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting cannabis is to dry and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based on the idea that
everyone is going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that isn't always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known for many years that you
lose up to 50 percent of the monoterpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the lower molecular
weight terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The so-called head space volatiles that
are going to be what you smell when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vicinity of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in drying and curing, you're losing 50
percent of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're a person like me that
believes that they're part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage of cannabis chemicals that
contribute to therapeutic effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is for the sake of
so-called smoke ability, we're squandering
[SPEAKER_00]: these important components, not just smell
and taste, but effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to develop a technique that
would preserve the profile of the fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as you see it growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves exposure of the fresh
cut flower to CO2 vapor from dry ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were hoping there'd be sort of a
lyophilization, freeze drying effect as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, get rid of some of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently some of it remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we did succeed quite well in
demonstrating a marked concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could kick the cannabinoid content
upwards of 60 percent in some cases and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically double or triple the terpenoid
fraction as compared to the fresh flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you end up with is what the
Moroccans term kief, basically separating
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes from the rest of the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to cannabis
therapeutics, aside from roots and some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that occur in the leaves to greater
extent than in the flower, when usually
[SPEAKER_00]: we're most interested in the cannabinoids
and terpenoids that occur in the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rest of what's in the flower is
really extraneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have a bunch of cell wall
ballast that's sort of fatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got chlorophyll, which you don't
need for therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all the woody material so
basically you're getting down to the nitty
[SPEAKER_00]: gritty of what's needed medicinally if
you're just looking at trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically the reason that
there's been hashish for thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ancestors in the Middle East figured
out a long time ago that the real action
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they couldn't see them at the
time, they knew how to separate them from
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the biomass and create this
concentrated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a sort of modern type of
hashish or kief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really important to me that we
do this with material that was organically
[SPEAKER_00]: grown and under control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where Jeremy Plum came in
because he has what to my knowledge is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most sophisticated indoor controllable
organic regenerative approach to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, I've seen a lot between
working at GW and having visited numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: of the licensed producers in Canada,
in the Netherlands, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are plenty of people growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few that I think are
growing it the way I'd like to see it
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this process, how practical do you
see this scaling commercially if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: more efficient way of preserving terpenes
and everything in the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a great question and one that
we're still trying to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it is, this takes some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did different sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was just with an hour of dry ice
exposure and we did two that way and two
[SPEAKER_00]: with 48 hours of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's probably overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that a happy medium is somewhere
a few hours of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a marked cost savings,
however, because with this process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not having to have a drying
facility or take that time to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ostensibly it'd be possible that you'd be
from fresh flower to the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: cryokeaf, as we call it, in just a few
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the yields are not fantastic,
but depending on the chemover involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did see yields that were quite
comparable to what people get with water
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now water hash can be a very nice product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are issues with it because
you end up with a bunch of wastewater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my knowledge, it would not be very
easy to fix that up and use it for another
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also end up with that process with
a bunch of sludgy biomass material that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, may not be good for much except
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cryokeaf, it's quite different,
however.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you end up with is flour that has
partially been denuded of its trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as we tested all the material
each step of the way, we know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining byproduct could also be
extracted by CO2 or cold ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not wasted at all,
which might be the case with water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, what we'd end up with is
this byproduct that's extractable plus a
[SPEAKER_00]: high-quality extract, the cryokeaf,
which we believe would be useful in a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of fashions.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, it may be very attractive
to the high-end keaf connoisseur market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it could be sold at a premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, for pharmaceutical
applications, this may be a much better
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go because, again, what you're
ending up with is a much purer product as
[SPEAKER_00]: your starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you've got, again, upwards of
60% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, depending on the source
material, somewhere six or 7% terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there probably is some water left
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not ending up with hundreds of
experiments with strenuous chemicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: really aren't contributing to the
therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this will be viable,
but it will be a specialty product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't quite worked out all the
economics, but we think it could be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing, depending on the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you touch a little bit on the
entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: And its therapeutic benefits in regards to
terpenes and how they may be medically
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the entourage effect, this term was
coined in 1998 by Professors Meshulam and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Shabbat in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, originally, they applied this to
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the idea that we have two main
endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide and
[SPEAKER_00]: two-arachidone glycerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they noted experimentally was
that related molecules, the entourage,
[SPEAKER_00]: that seemingly were inactive or had very
poor activity on their own when combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with the main players, anandamide and
two-AG, there was a markedly synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, say, on treating inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, they published another
article where they said, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this could apply to the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this keys into a concept that's been
present in botanical medicine forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there usually isn't one active
component or key ingredient, but rather a
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of chemicals that work in
concert to produce the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of analogous as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To traditional Chinese medicine,
TCM, where it's usually not a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning wonder, but rather a combination
of verbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might have two or three that
are aiming at the pain, but you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: additional ones that improve the taste or
reduce the side effect from the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis is like TCM or an entourage
under itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there are upwards of 150
different phyto-cannabinoids that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, beyond the familiar THC and CBD,
there are probably 10 others where we know
[SPEAKER_00]: a fair amount about the pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these has unique therapeutic
properties that are distinct from THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, you have the aromatic
components of cannabis, the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been 200 different ones
that have been described in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: None so far are unique to cannabis,
but they're common to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give a few examples, limonene is
going to be familiar to anyone who smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limonene is at the base of the
essential oils from all the citrus,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be orange, lemon, lime,
kumquats even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limonene is a well-tested molecule and
it has been shown in humans to have marked
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressant effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've recently done experiments at
Johns Hopkins with Ryan Vondray,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that limonene in conjunction with
THC makes a significant decrease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety levels that THC can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limonene is also an immune stimulating
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mersene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mersene is the most common terpene that we
find in cannabis in conjunction with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very soporific, produces fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what I like to call the couch
lock compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really can be helpful for sleep in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has anti-inflammatory properties as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linolule is common to cannabis and to
lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, even in humans, Linolule or
lavender essential oil has been shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a very effective anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been demonstrated clinically
in demented patients, patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease that can get quite
agitated, particularly at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So improvements in sleep, decreases in
nursing care have been demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things all are boosted by their
association with THC, CBD, or others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, and this is an
interesting one, karyophylline occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the distinction of being not just a
terpene, but a cannabinoid as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it works on something called the
CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 is a non-intoxicating receptor that
has pain relieving and anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having karyophylline along with THC and
other components can make it a better drug
[SPEAKER_00]: for pain or inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has an anti-addictive property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this is work that's been amply
demonstrated in basic science experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just a few of the examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you will hear from people that the
entourage effect isn't proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are plenty of examples,
whether they be now in humans or in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: work or in laboratory work that
demonstrate that there is this entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, there is synergy of these
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bold statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to prove the negative by
saying that the entourage effect isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wonder how much evidence is gonna
be sufficient for the doubters to come on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all anybody has to do is try
Marinal synthetic THC and compare that to
[SPEAKER_00]: what herbal cannabis is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be very self-evident that
these are two different types of effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: different animals, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC on its own is not a pleasant
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more apt to produce dysphoria,
unhappiness than euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite disorienting even to people
who are accustomed to use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with these other components,
they tend to tame THC and increase its
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic index, meaning increasing the
allowable dose that can exert the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic effects without producing side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I thought of is the work of Dr.
Ady Ray and the Cannabis Cup in Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: that Jeremy's also a part of, where they
found that the sensory experience by the
[SPEAKER_02]: judges was not necessarily like the
highest THC cultivars were not the
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consumers, even though we're driven by
THC from a marketing perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: from a consumer experience, sensory
experience, the high THC cultivars are not
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that are winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it fits with what you're saying about
this therapeutic experience, having all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other components to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along those lines, from a cultivation
perspective, one of the questions that was
[SPEAKER_02]: given to me from a cultivator was,
are there issues with unsafe levels in the
[SPEAKER_02]: case of making extracts in relation to
these terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any potential long-term issues for workers
that are being exposed on a daily basis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something to be concerned about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, what we usually see with
concentration rates is a loss of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've already mentioned, in the
drying and curing process, you're losing
[SPEAKER_00]: up to half of the lower molecular weight
monoterpenoids to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's compounded oftentimes by the
tendency to do supercritical CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction in one pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's really efficient at getting the
cannabinoids out, but also waste the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be better to do two passes,
one aimed at the terpenoid extraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: a separate one for the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going back to the question,
can you have too much terpenoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use the example of pining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pining is a very important agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually can reverse or eliminate the
short-term memory impairment from THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a little bit irritating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the concentration were too high,
it's gonna be irritating to the lungs and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause cough if it were inhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a possibility, but a rule of
thumb I like to use is follow what nature
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say for the sake of
discussion, we've got a cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that tests out at 25% THC or total
cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be a reasonable corresponding
content of terpenoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there, we usually see something,
5% would be a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe 20% of the cannabinoid content
would be a good figure for the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the terpenoid content, usually it's
much lower than that as I'm sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key thing would be, does it
produce irritation if it's inhaled?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are toxicities to the terpenoids
found in cannabis, but usually at very
[SPEAKER_00]: high concentrations or high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, these are agents that
are in our diet they're often used as food
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements and they're grasped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean the stuff in the lawn,
it means generally recognized as safe as
[SPEAKER_00]: food additives or flavoring agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, they're rare,
rare terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puligone, for example, I haven't seen it
in cannabis in many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there've been reports that it could
produce miscarriages, at least in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also found in pennyroyal,
which isn't recommended for pregnant
[SPEAKER_00]: women, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, these are very safe
compounds used in a reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure folks can take proper,
where PPE is appropriate, if needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting onto another question though,
I wanna jump back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had mentioned one of the reasons that
you did this most recent extraction study
[SPEAKER_02]: or sorry, a drawing study with Jeremy was
because of his facility and the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: he uses organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain a little more on why you
feel organic production is important from
[SPEAKER_02]: a medical perspective or a therapeutic
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first is a safety factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In organic culture, it's a given that
you're not gonna use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are things that just shouldn't
be in cannabis that consumers are
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing, particularly if it's inhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the same way that inhaling
cannabis smoke or vapor gets into the
[SPEAKER_00]: system very quickly, the same is gonna be
true for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, if something kills a bug,
there's a fair chance that it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity for humans as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain pesticides that target
receptors and insects that humans don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, most pesticides are bad
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that whole element.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that part's pretty obvious or
logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I can just say I've been
an organic farmer myself for, geez,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to me to know what I'm
putting into my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope the same would be particularly
true for people that are taking medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, again, beyond the safety
factor, I am quite convinced that growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants organically is going to provide a
healthier plant and a healthier product.
[SPEAKER_00]: By healthier product, I mean that a happy
plant is going to likely produce better
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be in the form of higher
yields of cannabinoids and terpenoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go back a step and ask,
why does the plant make these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't put on God's green earth
to get us high.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we know that is the human species is
under a million years old and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is 30 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you should ask, the question,
why are cannabinoids in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is actually
much older than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 300 million years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant happens to make these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does so for ecological reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making these chemicals, whether they be
cannabinoids or terpenoids, serves the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, it is to have antibiotic
effects, antifungal effects, and to
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's a happy accident for us that
these chemicals that the plant's making
[SPEAKER_00]: for its own purposes happen to be very
salutary, good for our health,
[SPEAKER_00]: or enjoyment, as the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have to recognize that things
are not the same today as they've always
[SPEAKER_00]: been.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has always been with respect to human
medicine was that medicine came from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only been in about the last 75 to
100 years that we've had the capability of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic chemistry to make drugs from
scratch that in some instances don't exist
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that can be a good thing or a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am well aware of the bad things
in terms of the toxicities, whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine from a plant often, not always,
but often is going to be safer and easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for the system to incorporate or detoxify
as the case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stop there for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the one thing I wanted to get back
to was the pesticide comment we do in
[SPEAKER_02]: organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some pesticides that I still
wouldn't want folks to use, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they would qualify as organic,
like erythrins, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to know how Sam over approved
from Jeremy are running their facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel quite confident in the quality
of their flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a definite concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other aspect from the cultivation and
cultivation perspective that you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on before the podcast was this
sort of the microbial relationship in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere between plant root exudates
and the microbiology that exists and how
[SPEAKER_02]: those work together in a symbiotic way to
really allow the plant to control its
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had an interesting analogy there if
you want to share it in relation to
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are humans, but we're complex
organisms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole gut microbiome that
consists of trillions of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without these, we would be in serious
trouble because they are responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: eating digestion, reducing inflammation,
and often producing chemicals that we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get from our food without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going through the substrate,
hopefully soil, and seeking nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they can manage this in a sterile
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they incorporate these nutrients
a lot better if there is also the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of appropriate other microbiota,
usually fungi in this instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a symbiosis there that they
nourish the fungi or bacteria and in
[SPEAKER_00]: return get help in incorporating the
nutrients that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: A proper ecology of a cannabis plant or a
tree or anything else is going to include
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself plus these other agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those agents are present,
plant finds it a lot easier to draw what
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a plant's really healthy,
maybe you don't have the need for any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these pesticides or even organic controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make it tough for cannabis in a lot of
instances because they're in crowded
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There usually isn't a lot of thought given
to providing these mycorrhizal agents that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to help the plant be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to use all these artificial
agents to try and control diseases after
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having proper nutrition of your plant more
naturally is like preventive medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: One could survive on McDonald's and
steroids, but you certainly wouldn't be as
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy as someone who's eating a balanced
diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be more likely to get illness,
be more susceptible to a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing that I thought of when we
were talking about proof and Jeremy was
[SPEAKER_02]: this goal he has of getting replicable
chemovar expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from a patient perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a consistent response every
time you consume a particular cultivar or
[SPEAKER_02]: a particular product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big argument I've heard for moving
towards more chemicals, more synthesized
[SPEAKER_02]: versions of THC is that we can get
consistent pharmaceutical responses or
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do this from a cultivation
perspective or as an organic grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that benefit the patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I need to say that it
not only should be done, it has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason I wanted to do this,
the experiment of proof was so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could highlight Jeremy's work in showing
that indoor organic regenerative culture
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis was practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, this is using the ultimate
control and controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it would be great if we could plant
outdoors under the sun and get
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducible crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the Pacific Northwest these
days, we have wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in the summer, there's smoke
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dust in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stray pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is pesticide contamination from your
neighbor drifting over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unfortunate, but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard thing to avoid or one heel
storm can wipe out your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's concentrate for a second on the
pharmaceutical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a pharmaceutical from a plant,
this has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be controlled every step of
the way to get the consistency that the
[SPEAKER_00]: food and drug administration requires of a
drug, that there's very little variance in
[SPEAKER_00]: the components from one batch to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sine qua non.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that, you don't get
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to maintain that throughout the
life of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires that you have consistent
genetics, but also consistent environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is best done in a greenhouse or
totally indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of indoors, using LED
lighting, it's possible to affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that in turn affects the
expression of these chemical components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the ultimate in scientific culture
for medical applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, though, there's all these
variables that the plant is exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: from how healthy is your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory, you're starting from clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we take the same clone all the
way through round after round.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see variances in irrigation,
pest pressure, all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients will all have impact on chemovar
expression, as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I'm wondering is,
you say it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get that level of consistency to
a point where maybe the FDA would accept
[SPEAKER_02]: something as medically consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with Epidiolex, which is a
purified CBD derived from plant It also
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex is extracts of a high THC plant
and a high CBD plant with other
[SPEAKER_00]: components, other cannabinoids and
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it was not approved clinically by
the FDA, it did make it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry manufacturing control process at
FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is the consistency was
demonstrated despite the fact that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were hundreds of components I could show
you a slide of 25 different batches of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex over nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traces superimposed look like single
peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see much variance at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Europe, when you're making
a medicine from a plant, they usually have
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed variation plus or minus on a
particular component of 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medically, it's got to be better than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accepted figure now is about 5%,
but with the FDA, I'm sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: variance was much, much less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have consistent genetics,
you have a stipulated process every step
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you at GW, it was 77 days from
when the rooted cuttings went out until
[SPEAKER_00]: they were harvested, not 76, not 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't use pesticides at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there were bugs, thrips and what have
you, they were dealt with through
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good bugs eat bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to say that it's easy or
that it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in the pharmaceutical market,
you're always paying a high price for what
[SPEAKER_00]: we hope will be an effective, safe and
consistent agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see this always being an extracted
product then, or do you think flour could
[SPEAKER_02]: get to a level to where we could get that
kind of consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ted, whether people like it or not,
there are always going to be three
[SPEAKER_00]: echelons of activity with cannabis-based
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbal cannabis isn't going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second echelon is supplements that
hopefully have some degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization and quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the top tier, if you will,
is pharmaceutical production, which again
[SPEAKER_00]: has to surpass a higher bar in terms of
all these stipulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are always going to be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you the US federal
government made a mistake in 1985 when the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA approved synthetic THC as Marinol and
thought that was going to take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole issue of herbal cannabis as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it won't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need this plant, essentially is what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all its glory and all its different
manifestations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to touch on that with you because
genetic diversity in cannabis is massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning more and more, it seems
like every day as to not just its effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what its potential is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How important is the genetic diversity
that we currently have in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you most excited about seeing
coming out of the cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we've only scratched the surface
of what it can do therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I previously mentioned, if there are
150 known phytocannabinoids, people mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: these days only have access to about three
in any concentration, THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, our team did the first human
study of cannabigerol, and it's turning
[SPEAKER_00]: out to be a fabulous agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same can happen for THCV and
cannabidi-phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of clinical studies that
have been done with cannabis in one form
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most of them have been with very
substandard materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly NIDA cannabis that really
creates a false impression of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make the statement that I don't
think any studies so far have been
[SPEAKER_00]: undertaken with what I would call an
optimized preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning being all it could be,
getting the right balance of therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: components, cannabinoids and terpenoids to
do the job the best way it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big part of what we're doing now at
CredoScience is trying to formulate for
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think are gonna be better
preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about your
company, CredoScience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ted, I've been at this for 26 years
now and working for other people and that
[SPEAKER_00]: has its pros and cons, but basically at
the ripe age of 68, I decided that like it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, I had to do this myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nisha Whitley and I started
CredoScience right at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That set us back a while, but the idea was
to develop some concepts that I'd been
[SPEAKER_00]: rattling around in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different approaches to cannabis and the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've discussed one of these
applications already and that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: CryoKeef technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have plans for a cannabis
based disinfectant, a cannabis treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: for head lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our formulation service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing lots of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also developed a screening test for the
genetic mutations that we observed in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that this isn't from
pesticides or neme or other explanations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people that have this seem to have a
genetic susceptibility that causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: get sick when they're using too much THC
on a chronic basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting because I have heard
the neme comments in many forums,
[SPEAKER_02]: along with a variety of other hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good to hear from an actual doctor
that that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not only that, I'm somebody that
uses neme on my fruit and berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's a good idea or not,
I've eaten stuff I sprayed the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't do any harm to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem like anything can have toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the toxicity we know to be
attached to neem doesn't match that of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would like a different
explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate truth is some people are
susceptible to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we find out otherwise,
they shouldn't be using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be really unfortunate for the
people involved because they find it
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a whole podcast with Shango on the
shaping fire podcast on this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to mention to folks,
if you're interested in more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical therapy side, I think you've done
six podcasts now with Shango over there
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly suggest people go check those
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention that as a resource
for folks before I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have thought of using a
cannabis product for head lice,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's only a 4,000 year prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was described by the ancient
Sumerians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in what's now Iraq, 4,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a simple prescription,
cannabis on lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the exact same thing is done
contemporaneously in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use fresh cannabis and rub it on the
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can do this much more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do is hone in on which
components are most efficacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know already that certain phyto
cannabinoids and terpenoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a relatively straightforward set
of experiments to prove the concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you mentioned Neem, which made me
think about all the applications that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have for Neem historically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've used Neem shampoo and Neem
toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used as a pesticide and a fungicide
as disinfectant in many cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that one of the main benefits
you're seeing with the head lice is
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to the oils in the cannabis is
more of just a suffocant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it have something like
azadirachtin where it has a chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: component that you feel is really creating
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my slide presentations, they show an
example of what happens when aphids are on
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is their little legs break the
trichomes, which then burst and polymerize
[SPEAKER_00]: and trap the bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get killed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the components of the trichome,
cannabinoids and terpenoids are also
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mechanical and chemical are the
mechanisms there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the case, why do we have such
a proliferation of insect problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: flower and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once those trichomes come in,
how come hemp russet or even the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: aphid are so successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, part of it's monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often in nature, a plant is growing with
other plants and it may see out things
[SPEAKER_00]: that help protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companion planting, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing, and I think this is
important, we have a lot of culture of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that aren't in the right
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got people that are trying to
grow Afghani genetics in a humid climate
[SPEAKER_00]: where Afghanistan's pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of its maladaption of the
particular chemovar genetically to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's trying to be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, nutrition really enters in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of these plants that are
subject to insect attack are not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need from their substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if there were a rich soil with
all the necessary bacteria and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be much less likely
that be subject to the same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: predation and damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with that to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that we see in controlled
environment agriculture when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors, too, you don't have natural
enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have the natural bio controls
for a lot of these pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once one enters a facility,
it's much harder to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas out in nature, you wouldn't have
those same issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I have a fruit tree outside,
for example, with aphids, but yet my
[SPEAKER_02]: entire garden is not infested with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're primarily on this one plant and
they're not even covering the entire tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just covering a portion of the
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just natural ways outdoors that
these things are more controlled for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't necessarily kill the plant
because it's not necessarily in the pest's
[SPEAKER_02]: interest from a survival perspective to
kill a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs something to continue to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that being the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was there anything else that you
wanted to touch on in regards to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the research you've been working on that
you'd like to share with listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we've probably covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like, again, to make a pitch
to people for the idea that, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do organic regenerative culture of
cannabis and even indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that people will use your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I spend a lot of time looking at
ingredients and things I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure I've ever seen products
better balanced, having the things I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen the results in terms of what
cannabis looks like when it has this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of substrate available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, boy, there's no more compelling
evidence than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to get you some soil for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't quite do it this season,
but next season I'm looking at getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some raised beds put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's important to me what goes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might try a little hugelkulter,
but we need... Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been working now with Jeremy
and Sam over at Proof for a year or two
[SPEAKER_02]: with providing them with media,
with soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been a really wonderful
experience because of all the data
[SPEAKER_02]: collection they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really able to refine and improve
our processes because of the feedback that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that some of the other
facilities that we work with are doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know Proof is starting to experiment
with, is this idea of reusing the media
[SPEAKER_02]: too in the facility, which can lead to
some challenges around consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, every time you harvest a
plant, you're pulling out organic matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pulling out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those have to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So replacing them to the exact levels that
they were at before and keeping the
[SPEAKER_02]: biology consistent to what it was to get
that same chemo of our expression is
[SPEAKER_02]: really challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have some facilities that have
been reusing soil now for five to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years, in some cases, at five cycles a
year indoors quite successfully with good
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope and think that's really the future
from a sustainability perspective of how
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to cultivate, not just from a
cost and labor perspective, but also just
[SPEAKER_02]: from an environmental perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that sounds very promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to hopefully seeing you
at another event locally as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You picked the best year not to garden
because we are having historically cold
[SPEAKER_02]: weather this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a gardener's nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you again and have a wonderful
rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Dr. Ethan Russo and you are
