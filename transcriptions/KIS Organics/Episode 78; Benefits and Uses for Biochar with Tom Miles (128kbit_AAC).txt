[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_03]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our guest this week is Tom Miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom is the president of TR Miles Technical
Consultants in Portland, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: a biomass energy consulting firm,
which designs, develops, installs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and commissions systems for processing
wood, agricultural, and urban residues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovative biomass systems include
pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion,
[SPEAKER_03]: sizing, drying, densification,
handling, modification of boilers and
[SPEAKER_03]: gasifiers to improve efficiency and
emissions, and systems to recycle
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has developed heat and power systems in
developing countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: His knowledge of ash transformations and
biomass led to recycling nutrients using
[SPEAKER_03]: pyrolysis of residues to biochar,
which can improve soil health and
[SPEAKER_03]: sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has sponsored and hosted online
discussions of biomass energy and biochar
[SPEAKER_03]: since 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a past chairman of the International
Biochar Initiative and executive director
[SPEAKER_03]: of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biochar Initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Tom, can we start off with you telling
me a little bit about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am an engineering consultant in
Portland, Oregon, fourth generation in
[SPEAKER_00]: wood products in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grew up in the wood products
industry, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our firm has been doing mechanical
engineering for wood products and
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable energy for a few generations
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 15 years ago, after spending
something like 25 years working with
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable energy projects, everything from
improved cooking stoves to very large
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass boilers, was about the time that
biochar was rediscovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always have a certain amount of the
charcoal as a co-product or byproduct of
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion, gasification, pyrolysis
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I learned that the biochar could
be used to manage nutrients from manures
[SPEAKER_00]: and that sort of thing, I got interested
in the use of biochar, production of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar as a co-product of biomass energy
and the use of biochar for improving soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and managing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with my father for about 25
years and have been on my own for about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my office is here again in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my role with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative, we created the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been the executive director of
the organization for the last five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all volunteers trying to create
biochar as a business and as a productive
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go back a little bit and just
cover the basics for folks who aren't as
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people, when they talk
about biochar, they think of the Amazon
[SPEAKER_03]: basin and maybe like terra preta.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's obviously a very different
product than what we're producing with
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is some relationship there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you maybe touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can start with terra preta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I led a group from the International
Biochar Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a conference in Brazil in 2010 in
Rio de Janeiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went up to the Amazon where
Embrapa, the Brazilian research
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, agriculture research
research organization, had dug pits for us
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soils that were terra preta and
what they call terra mulata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wound up being the interpreter for
the trip, having lived in Brazil and speak
[SPEAKER_00]: Portuguese and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting to me to discover
that along the banks of the Amazon,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up, we were told that the Amazon
had this rare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amazons has rich tropical life and
that drops nutrients down to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soils are actually very poor clay
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it happens along the banks of the
Amazon, where the natives lived over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three or four thousand years,
they would grow their crops around their
[SPEAKER_00]: dwellings and then they would burn that
crop residue, both wood and grasses and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and leave a charcoal residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some debate as to whether they
need the charcoal intentionally or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that then would combine with nutrients
in the form of their kitchen waste and
[SPEAKER_00]: sewage and compost together and become a
combine with the clay soil and become a
[SPEAKER_00]: rich charcoal rich, carbon rich compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carbon would capture the nutrients
from the from the vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that it wouldn't leach down and
just into the root group that would stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the natives were cropping annually
every year on the same soil without going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the slash and burn into the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the Spanish and Portuguese
arrived, they found that it is with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly rich native culture and
civilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where a lot of the stories came
from, the stories of the Amazon women and
[SPEAKER_00]: the men covered in gold and these kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Spanish and Portuguese priests and
explorers found that basically these
[SPEAKER_00]: natives had a good renewable regenerative
agriculture in a strip not more than about
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 yards wide on either side of the
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you follow all the way up the main
front of the Amazon river and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: splits into two different rivers,
and you add all those soils together,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an area the size of France that
was enriched with this charcoal enriched
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at biochar, what biochar
is charcoal that is made instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal, it's made for cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cooking charcoal typically contains
tars and oils to help ignite the charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biochar is you cook it long enough so
that you have baked out the tars and oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this nice honeycomb kind
of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has physical properties that are
very similar to some of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments like vermiculite and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has chemical properties and it has
surface area that will absorb both absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: and adsorb chemicals and nutrients,
potassium and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the soluble nutrients that are
available not only from manures,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plants and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then scientists are now discovering
that it also has electrochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties which assist with the
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, it feed biochar to animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually helps the metabolism in the
rumen, improves the efficiency of feed
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion, helps keep animals healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have these physical,
chemical and biological attributes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biochars themselves are good habitats
for microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so biochars have sometimes been
described as geo batteries and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can hang on to chemicals and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help cycle carbon from
photosynthesis through the soil solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and thereby help both with not only with
carbon cycle but also with the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and help feed the microorganisms
that are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference really between the
biochar and the terra preta is that terra
[SPEAKER_00]: preta was the full package of basically a
composted biochar mineral complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biochar plus clay plus the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biochar is the building block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically the charcoal,
but it's charcoal for use in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the term biochar was coined by our
friend the late Dr. Peter Reed from New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand who felt that we should use a term
of charcoal intended for use in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than charcoal intended for use as a
fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't aware of that benefit with the
rumen with livestock.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same electrochemical property has also
reduced the amount of energy that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to transfer nutrients to plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's also partly what's responsible
for the efficient, as you well know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever we use biochar in the root zone,
in the rhizosphere, we get this really
[SPEAKER_00]: generous root growth, very active root
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's being used, for example,
as backfill in planting urban trees and
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because early on, it helps the tree
establish really vigorous root structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that part of the
mechanism is that by facilitating the
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer of nutrients to the root hairs,
the tree roots, it helps to encourage that
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we make biochar, ranging from a
commercial operator operation down to
[SPEAKER_03]: someone who just wanted to try
experimenting with home?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you touched on the fact that we
don't want to be using charcoal
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily, and that there is a
difference there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on how it's made and the
importance of the pyrolysis process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start with where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is with wood, with either wood or
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biomass contains about 50% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you heat the biomass, that solid
converts to gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 80% of the solid converts to a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 20% of the solid converts to
charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're burning wood,
for example, as you can see in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fireplace, you can see the little gas
coming out of the fire log.
[SPEAKER_00]: That accounts for about 80% of the mass of
that fire log converts to a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it burns as a gas, whereas about
20% burns as charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the glowing coals,
actually the glow in the coals is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: those are more tars and volatiles that are
just simply burning on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the charcoal will burn in direct
contact with air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charcoal doesn't need to convert to a
gas to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can burn in direct at the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can burn in direct contact with air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by burning, it's basically oxidizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the oxygen reacting with the carbon
and creating CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to make charcoal, we need to
heat the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can heat it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can heat it through what's called
pyrolysis, where you heat it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: absence of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not adding any air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes this is done by putting
biomass into a canister and then putting
[SPEAKER_00]: the canister into a fire and then
providing the heat from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a place to vent that canister
because the solid will convert to a gas
[SPEAKER_00]: and the gas will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you ignite that gas, you see that
it's a combustible gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've converted the solid to a form that
can burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is called gasification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, you're using a third of
the air that you would ordinarily use to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely burn the solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think of it as burning about a
third of the wood to convert the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood to gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, in the case of pyrolysis,
your char yield is going to be in the 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30% range of the dry weight of the wood
you start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of gasification, the yield
typically is in the 15% range because some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the air that you've introduced reacts
directly with that charcoal converts it to
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it reduces the amount of charcoal
yield and the rest converts to gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hopefully you use and recover in
some way to generate heat or power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third mechanism is simply through
combustion or ordinarily burning wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have charcoal embers left over
or in a boiler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you'll have fine charcoal
particles that will carry out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: boiler with the combustion gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those can be separated in the gas
cleaning device and recovered and used as
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in each one of those cases,
you want the material to get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that's in the centigrade range
in the 300 to 350 to 400 to 600 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade range for most char.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get high temperature char that are
above 600 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put that in perspective in terms of
Fahrenheit, typically the gasification
[SPEAKER_00]: range where you add a little bit of air
gets you into the 12 to 1400 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combustion will get into the 15 to 1800
degree temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pyrolysis, you hold down to the 800 to
1000 degree range to provide each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the simplest way to make biochar is in
what's called a pit kiln, in which you
[SPEAKER_00]: simply dig a pit, a conical pit or a
sleep-sided pit, and put the biomass in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Malawi, for example, we have
smallholders who farm small plots of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, they dig a small pit and
take their corn stover from their corn
[SPEAKER_00]: stover or their corn or maize harvest and
put it in the pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pit has deep sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by lighting the material from the top,
it's what we call a top-lit updraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiant heat from burning material on
the top tends to heat the material that's
[SPEAKER_00]: below it in the pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pit keeps the oxygen from getting
to the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the material is sitting there
bathing in a pool of so-called pyrolysis
[SPEAKER_00]: gases, the gases that evolve from heating
the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tends to promote charcoal
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wind up making a charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it winds up being made at a low enough
temperature so that a lot of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in the corn stover aren't cooked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they eventually cover the pit to
cool off the char and take the char and
[SPEAKER_00]: combine it with a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nutrient source, typically manure,
at planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they plant their corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one way of making,
in a pit kiln, you're basically using the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiant heat from the gaseous combustion
to heat the solid, convert the solid to
[SPEAKER_00]: char and gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use the char beneficially in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of making biochar is in a
gasifier where you use, you add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of air to burn some of the gas to
provide heat to char or carbonize the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in Malawi, what they do is use a
gasifier to gasify the corn cobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take that char and feed it to
their chickens and cows and wind up with
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy animals with less disease and
increase their milk production.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those kinds of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in the United States,
it's illegal to feed charcoal or biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: of any kind to animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some feeding trials going on in
Nebraska to try to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, it makes a good feed,
makes a good soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an industrial case, you basically use a
reactor which is sometimes called a
[SPEAKER_00]: retort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's an auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you heat the outside of the auger to
heat the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run the material in the auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about 40 minutes to heat the
material, convert the solids to gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you burn the off gas often to dry the
material that you're putting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are larger kilns that are
rotating drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you feed the material into a rotating
drum that looks like a cement mixer to
[SPEAKER_00]: long kiln.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use either the off gas from
pyrolysis or you use an auxiliary gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you heat the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either heat the drum from the outside
or you burn the gas and put the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: through the inside of the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, heats the material,
converts the solid to a gas, and you wind
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a char product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yields in these different
processes can be something in the order of
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% to 30% of what you start with,
you wind up with as char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that char contains about 50% of the
energy content that you started with with
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've converted, again, about 80% of
the mass and about 50% of the energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be able to recover
that gas and use it to make steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can generate power, except that's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can use the steam to heat water
for processed water or steam for
[SPEAKER_00]: processing the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In China, for example, they provide an
incentive to the farmers to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: corn stover and their wheat straw to a
fertilizer plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer plant converts that stover
to char by using the same industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: process of pyrolysis and a rotating drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they will use the off gas to heat
the stover to create the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, they'll use some of
the off gas to make steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that steam then they'll use to treat
the char to activate it, as it's called,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will improve the properties of the
char.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add fertilizer components to the
char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they granulate it and they sell a
granulated biochar based fertilizer back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're producing about 500,000 tons
per year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they expect to get to 3 million tons
before long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making a very active industrial
use of biochar in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: By contrast here in the United States,
we're producing somewhere in the 50 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 70,000 tons a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 150 biochar producers and
suppliers in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's slowly growing as people are
discovering the many uses for char and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing markets and understanding,
more importantly, the needs of their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned a few different methods
for making biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the quality of the final product
vary from a soil health perspective when
[SPEAKER_03]: you talk about gasification versus
pyrolysis, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you control the factors of
production, if you control temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: time, then you typically can make a
similar quality of biochar regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gasifier chars tend to be slightly
higher temperature chars because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: partially oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've used a little air in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they tend to burn off more of the
chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very clean, clean chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood chars from gasification and
combustion work very well for filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're trying to capture heavy
metals from stormwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good surface properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrolysis chars can, if you cook them long
enough, have very similar properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they also have different,
some different surface characteristics,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are called functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The functional groups have different
abilities to attract certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, most chars, many chars are
very similar for most common uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using the chars in the soil,
if you're using char as an additive to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, that's a very popular and very
effective use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use about five or 10% biochar by
weight or 10 to 20% by volume together
[SPEAKER_00]: with organics, and you wind up with a
biochar-based compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you can actually accommodate
a wide variety of qualities of high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and low temperature chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges we've had
commercially is that we've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have been producing biochars
have not necessarily had industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, and they produce an
inconsistent quality of chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily the fact that
their char is good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simply that different batches of
char maybe have different qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the buyers complain about
truckloads having different qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to use the char in a
recipe, in a soil amendment recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to have at least a consistent
product that they can depend on as they
[SPEAKER_00]: add char as a component to other materials
for a soil amendment, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of what we call a
buffering capacity in char, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of leeway in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make some pretty good quality
chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: As people look at the kilns, the pit kiln
in its metal form took the form of what
[SPEAKER_00]: was called a kontiki kiln.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, we're calling those flame cap
kilns because that flame that burns above
[SPEAKER_00]: the pit is providing the heat that's doing
the carbonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that style of making biochar makes
actually a very good quality biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slightly oxidized gasification
char.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those units, the small portable units,
are more place-based applications where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making char from orchard prunings
or vineyard prunings, that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: for use actually right there in the
orchard and the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to take the material very
far, and you move the metal carbonizer or
[SPEAKER_00]: kiln around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where biochars are made, in a stationary
application about the size of today's
[SPEAKER_00]: modern charcoal plant, then you're looking
at chars that are being shipped pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good distances to specific applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those cases, they use more
sophisticated processing and very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully control char quality for
specific uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, they'll make what we've been
calling designer chars or chars that are
[SPEAKER_00]: made for specific uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made for specific applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's different about those chars
typically is that they're carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled for their size and other
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're meant to absorb mercury and
metals, for example, in filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: applications or remediating soils,
you might tilt the process a little bit if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got good control over it to have
the chars have slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some sort of basic tests for char
quality, and that is if you want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically clean and porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you take the char and crush it
in your hands, you hope that it's friable,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it crushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you taste the char or smell it,
you don't want to smell a lot of oily,
[SPEAKER_00]: tarry products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to smell pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take the char and you put your
hands in it, you want to be able to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: that char off with water instead of
needing soap to wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an indication that it doesn't
have any tars and oils in the char and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the kind of feel and taste
and wash tests that we use just to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that you've got a char that's
been cooked long enough at an adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature so that it's not carrying a
lot of tars and oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tars and oils can be recovered in a
contained device, whether you're heating
[SPEAKER_00]: char in a 50-gallon drum or whether you're
putting it through an industrial process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can condense three different densities
of liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gases that are made by heating the
char contain some light, we call it wood
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar or pyrolygnius acids, and those
are used sometimes as growth stimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you can pay $6 for a
liter of wood vinegar in Japan,
[SPEAKER_00]: use it as a foliar spray, and it turns out
that one of the active ingredients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar spray are actually nanocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very, very small-size carbon
particles that can penetrate the stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: of a leaf directly, kind of mainlining
biochar, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that within the wood vinegars,
there are what they call signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds or the smoke-smelling,
smoke-like compounds that actually act as
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wood vinegar can be used as a
growth stimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used straight as the tars,
for example, which are heavier,
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be condensed, and those can be
used as a preservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Brazil, for example, they will take
the mix of wood tars and vinegars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take the tar and they'll dilute it
200 to 1 for use as a wood preservative to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect against termites, and they'll use
it 2,000 to 1 with water to use as a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those products are not widely used
here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We import some wood vinegar products from
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's only about one producer
that has industrial uses for wood vinegar
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we look down the road, we look to
see more of those products being refined
[SPEAKER_00]: and developed and sold here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now, Tom, you'd mentioned,
well, you touched on a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, that I wanted to go
back to was how you evaluate a charcoal or
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how would a consumer be able to tell
the difference between these different
[SPEAKER_03]: types of burnt products, whether it be
soot or ash or charcoal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are labeling rules about biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four or five years ago, the American
Association of Plant Food Control
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials, which is an association of
agricultural departments from each state
[SPEAKER_00]: around the country and Canada,
and Mexico, all get together and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decide what constitutes a label for a
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided that biochar,
to call something biochar on a label,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had to have at least 60% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you buy a product on a shelf,
a Soil Amendment, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has biochar in it, or if you buy a
straight biochar, it should have 60% or
[SPEAKER_00]: more carbon in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the biochar, so that it would have more
carbon and less ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ash are natural ash ingredients,
calcium, potassium, other components,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you cook down the biomass to
biochar, that ash will increase as a
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of the total because you've
reduced the amount of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of the chars will have a high
ash component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make biochar from the straws or
agricultural residues, they start out with
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher ash content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna wind up with less than
60% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean they're bad
biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means they have a different
balance of ash to carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to understand if a char is
coming from an agricultural residue and it
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't labeled biochar, then typically
it'll have a slightly higher ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower carbon component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you use it sort of proportionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use it maybe in a slightly different
way than you would use a wood ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what you want to do
with the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want biochar to change the texture
of a soil or a growing mix, then any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a soil additive, whether it's biochar
or whether it's a mineral like a
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite or perlite, you really need to
add about 25% of soil mix before you
[SPEAKER_00]: really see a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends in terms of quality.
It depends on how you're gonna use the
chars.
There are also chars that are made from
manures, and those only change in texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want it to be an aid to water
holding capacity, that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you may only need to add 5% or 10%
biochar to a compost or to a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends in terms of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how you're gonna use the
chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also chars that are made from
manures, and those only have 10 to 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, or 10 to 20% carbon, but they
have lots and lots of other beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically not as much nitrogen because
nitrogen is cooked off in the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll have potassium and phosphorus
and calcium and a lot of other minerals in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of biochar quality,
if you're buying it in a bag, if it says
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, then it'll have 60% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some biochar producers claim that they
will have 80% carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very high carbon typically made
from a wood product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a bulk char and you can
do that sort of see and feel test,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it passes that sort of wash your hands
and feel it and taste it test,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be a pretty good quality char
that's gonna be in that 60% or better char
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a consumer, I think what you do like
any other, for a soil application,
[SPEAKER_00]: any other growing media, you try it out
and you make sure that you're feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants sufficiently with enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things to be aware of is that
if you add char to a growing mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: the char will actually preferentially
absorb, initially absorb nutrients like
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if your plants go yellow and you
wind up being a little chlorotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to add a little extra fertilizer,
whether it be an organic fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a feather meal or a nitrogen source of
some kind for the biochar to absorb and
[SPEAKER_00]: not take it away from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just really with the initial
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you haven't lost that
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just simply resides in the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the organisms will make that
nutrient available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially, you wanna be able to
counteract or offset the nutrient demand
[SPEAKER_00]: of the char itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just simply will take up a certain
amount of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of use the analogy of feeding straw
to a beef cow, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about 4% nitrogen just to supply
enough nitrogen for the animal to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to metabolize the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with char, it takes a certain amount
of nutrients just simply to satisfy the
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite of the char, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it won't take it away from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the quality issue is a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really, as an organization,
as an industry, we need to find ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying grades of biochar suitable for
particular applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the challenge is there
are many different qualities of char that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's matching the quality of the char
to the application is really the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do wanna highlight that for people
because I think it is important if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing biochar that you do your
homework and know what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good biochar company should be able to
provide you with testing and information
[SPEAKER_03]: about the product that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should be consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen this problem in some of the
industries that I'm more involved in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of certain people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting out product at lower costs that
may not be of the same quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really important to,
I think, do your due diligence,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially with an industry like this
that's sort of an emerging technology as
[SPEAKER_03]: people are still learning about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the other thing too is simply really
has less to do with the biochar than it
[SPEAKER_00]: does to do with the fact that it is a new
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get people who have great ideas about
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They over-promote the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they deliver a product that
doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't show the customer how to use
the product appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things fail and then everybody has
a bad idea about biochar in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it typically takes three to five years
to start a business and it takes three to
[SPEAKER_00]: five years for people to get used to
developing a product that is useful and
[SPEAKER_00]: matching the product of the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can always tell, when a biochar
producer calls, I can typically tell
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that producer has gotten to the
point where they really understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we've been using biochar
now, oh boy, I want to say close to a
[SPEAKER_03]: decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father, you know, has got really,
as you already know, I'm just sharing this
[SPEAKER_03]: for listeners, got really involved with
the Kintiki kiln.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Kintiki kiln that we use fairly
regularly to burn material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've been working with Black Owl
biochar as the product source for us in
[SPEAKER_03]: our soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen wonderful results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen on average, you know,
across a variety of different growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, somewhere around the range of
like eight to 10% better plant growth and
[SPEAKER_03]: yield with the addition of biochar in the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and one of the nice things about the
Black Owl biochar is that the producer is
[SPEAKER_00]: a user producer and that she was growing
organic vegetables when she discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar and growing peonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a result of her doing some
testing of adding biochar to her favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: growing mix with peonies that got her
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she got into the business of
producing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So her criteria for biochar quality comes
from the point of view of a consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, other companies that have
incorporated biochar into their product,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Kellogg Garden, for example,
in California, they have about a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pretty good sized company that's
been in business since the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent about four or five years
experimenting with biochar before they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to incorporate biochar into a
product with their label on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they needed to protect the
integrity as well of their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been very happy with the
products they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a couple of biochar-amended
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others, some organic products,
one called Sustain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has taken their basic organic
fertilizer and added biochar to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their customers are very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there are some quality
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the other end of the spectrum,
there are people that put together what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think is a quality material that may
have worked within their own soils in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own garden, but when they put it out
and sell it to the general public,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may or may not be very good about
explaining how it should be used and in
[SPEAKER_00]: what soils and circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you talk a little bit and talk
about why biochar is so important from an
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental perspective?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I hear the idea of burning
wood for the sake of improving my soil on
[SPEAKER_03]: the surface, that sounds like a really
negative environmental experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about why it's important and
beneficial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the carbon, in making biochar,
you're converting the carbon that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: developed through, pulled out of the
atmosphere through photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're converting it to a form that
can be, as they say, recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stay in the soil for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really removing carbon from the
atmosphere, and you're putting it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: form where you can put it in the soil,
and it will stay in the soil for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, the biochar will
catalyze the whole biological process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to say that the magic of
biochar is biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really stimulating the biology by
providing, by improving the ability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and so on to photosynthesize carbon
and remove it from the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle it through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you're taking a
renewable source of energy, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: converting it either to energy or to
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a great deal of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 3,000 peer-reviewed
academic papers a year on the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar in different applications,
and about half of those are devoted to
[SPEAKER_00]: improving the conversion processes of
making biochar and recovering more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, in a Contiki kiln,
which really is an engineered pit kiln,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're recovering about 50 to 60 percent
of the carbon that was in the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding now is ways to
recover even more of that carbon and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into forms that are recalcitrant that
won't break down for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the exciting things to
soil scientists 100 years ago when they
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered the terapeurate in the Amazon,
and also the biochar that's been used in
[SPEAKER_00]: man-made or anthropogenic soils in seven
or 800 locations around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, here you could put carbon
into a form that was going to last in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for literally thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's carbon removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen the first sale of carbon
credits for using biochar from a producer
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the United States, selling in the
European market, the volunteer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see other methodologies in other
markets evolving for trading biochar on
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it's got a value of
removing carbon from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that carbon side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, there's the
biological side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as evidence of the nexus of the two,
of the carbon and the biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've been doing trials,
where they've been looking at the degree
[SPEAKER_00]: to which carbon is removed from the
atmosphere where they've used biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: over a 10-year period, they find that far
more carbon is actually accumulated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil than just the amount that accounts
for the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's typically 10% or more increase
in carbon sequestration from having used
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar to stimulate the biology and truly
regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get some real benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge with biochar, part of the
challenge with biochar today is simply the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making it in the smallholder
situation, and thousands of smallholders
[SPEAKER_00]: in Asia, Africa, and South America have
been using biochar as a soil amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there they make it in very simple
kilns, and they use their own labor so
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have a lot of capital invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can benefit from its attributes
pretty directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In developed countries, in Europe,
the United States, it's growing more
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly as a material simply because we do
things in an industrial approach in a
[SPEAKER_00]: process that requires labor and more
expensive inputs in terms of electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the biochar becomes fairly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking forward to those carbon
markets helping to offset the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar so it can be less expensive to our
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the carbon side, we're also seeing
products that are incorporating biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: into building materials where it will also
last for a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being incorporated into cement and
asphalt, being incorporated into plastics,
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of different combinations that
liquid portion is being polymerized into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might call it, natural plastic-like
materials which will last for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this carbon benefit as well as
getting this agronomic benefit and the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know about the building
materials side either.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been focused on the agriculture uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of the things I want to touch on
that you kind of danced around to was this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea that it'll help fight global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's improving our soil fertility,
which you talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the thing that my father was most
interested in is this idea of reducing
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also forestry waste where we can take
the, when the logging occurs, they can
[SPEAKER_03]: come back in and grab some of that,
I believe it's just called slash material
[SPEAKER_03]: and burn that to reduce the risk of forest
fires while also sequestering the carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: that can then be applied back onto those
lands or potentially sold as a byproduct
[SPEAKER_03]: to an agricultural source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, our principal supporter for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotar Initiative is actually the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quite interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, the wildfire hazard is quite
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 57,000 wildfires last year in the
United States covering 10.3 million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year before that we had about 43,000
fires covering about four and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the year before that we had
about in the 50,000 fires again covering
[SPEAKER_00]: about eight and a half million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to the insurance folks,
there are four million homes that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: danger from wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it varies from state to
state, but pretty much across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are serious problems with wildfire
and so the, from the forest residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the buildup of not only the
forest residues that are left from
[SPEAKER_00]: logging, but also simply the buildup of
poorly managed forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this great collection of forest
fuels which causes the wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Forest Service has been interested
in the conversion of these lower value
[SPEAKER_00]: materials which can't be converted into
solid wood products for building and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: into, into biochar and biochar for use in
applications to improve forest health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biochar is a great filtration media for
cleaning up waterways and in our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: forest we have about 300,000 abandoned
farm, mine lands that are leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals into waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by taking some of these forest
residues, converting them to biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can actually filter and permanently tie
up those minerals that cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's restoration work going on in
places like Colorado and so on that have
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in Oregon, in Southern Oregon at
a nickel mine, various other mines so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working with the Forest Service
looking at locations where biochars can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for improving rangeland, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found in the Rockies, they found that
by adding biochar to grazing land,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can improve and increase the water
retention in grazing land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can actually get an additional
month of grazing by adding biochar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing land and the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, of course, the crop residues
here in Oregon, we export about 700,000
[SPEAKER_00]: tons of our straw from our grass seed
harvest to Japan and Korea and Taiwan as a
[SPEAKER_00]: feed supplement, as a dairy feed
supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's more difficult with straw
residues like in Eastern Washington where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have wheat straw that has a different
texture and application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've finally seen in Eastern Washington
now there's a paper mill that's making
[SPEAKER_00]: paper from wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been a market for that for
the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years ago, we did have paper mills that
were making paper from straw, but we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been importing wood from around the globe
at a very low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that hasn't been an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are also crop residues and
processing residues like manures from
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic digestion, the digestate from
anaerobic digestion that can be converted
[SPEAKER_00]: to biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the combination if you look at the
U.S., we have supposedly, according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Energy, about a billion tons
of both residues and potential energy
[SPEAKER_00]: crops of various kinds that could be
converted to fuel and other chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: products and byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And biochar can be a co-product of some of
that processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially we could make biochar as a
co-product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant in Oregon that will be
making and Lakeview that will be making
[SPEAKER_00]: jet fuel from wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the co-products will be
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can help work on our,
improve the increased renewable energy at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time, find a home for some of
these residues and some of the parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the residues that can't otherwise be used,
heavily barky residues or some of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: residues and manures and waste and so on
by converting them to energy and biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to following up with you
about this jet fuel option and the biochar
[SPEAKER_03]: that's coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wonderful to hear about more
renewable energy sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to tie everything back together
though, I wanted to ask you, so we had
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about from a user perspective,
growing plants and in regards to soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health and that use for biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we start, for example, in our soils,
when I talk about making soilless media,
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially we're at five to 8% by volume
of our total mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned people using biochars up to
25% and considering it more as a portion
[SPEAKER_03]: of your aeration essentially in your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using it to control gas exchange,
air exchange, there are some properties of
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar that I think we should touch on,
which is the fact, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has a very high cation exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tends to be alkaline, which raises your
pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are these things sort of accounted for
on a practical level when combined into a
[SPEAKER_03]: soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to start with, most of the biochars
are analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system of analysis was developed by
the International Biochar Initiative and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are certain laboratories like
control laboratories in California that
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the International Biochar
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protocols were identifying other
laboratories around the country that are
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of analyzing biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do get numbers or reference
numbers you can use on alkalinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: on cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tool on the International
Biochar Initiative website where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: plug in the properties of your biochar and
it will suggest uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a soil additive or as a growing media,
it looks at particle size, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as growing media is concerned,
for example, in one case we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar as a co-product from gasification
for use in a nursery growing tree
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nursery was using typical of what
used to be called the Cornell mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was 50% bark because bark is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% vermiculite and 25% peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started substituting,
we did some tests substituting different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of biochar from the gasifier,
substituting the biochar for the
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite, looking primarily at
replacing the sort of physical properties
[SPEAKER_00]: of vermiculite with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that we could add up to 25%
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we ran into the situation where
because of the, instead of using peat,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were using compost as a peat
substitute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost happened to be alkaline and so
we ran into an issue with one of the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was sugar pine, one of the tree
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the fun parts about doing
experiments in a tree nursery is you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got hundreds of thousands of trees to look
at in the greenhouse as you look across
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can tell whether a species has a
particular property or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were able to actually go to high
rates of substitution with the biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, relying primarily on the physical
characteristics of the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that case, you've got fertigation,
so you're actually supplying the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer and so on to the tree seedlings
and you're not depending on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: other attributes of the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically it's interesting because 5%
keeps coming up again and again as sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best, between 5 and 10%, sort of the
best rate of application of biochar to,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of whether it's an organic
media or soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be a level where you get
the best benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now relating to this tree trial you
did, did you see other issues associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with the high rates of biochar besides
just alkalinity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have to treat it with some
nitrogen prior to adding it in so it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't cause the plants yellowing and
nitrogen robbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, in that case with the
seedlings, you've got a fertilizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation type situation where you're
constantly adjusting and balancing
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably did increase nitrogen
initially to balance the effect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, especially at those very high
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the high rates,
to give you an example, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: composting operation in Missouri that's
using a lot of biochar because the more
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar they use, the more food waste they
can take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, food waste has much higher nitrogen
and higher nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: than their typical organics in the
composting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting, and they'll openly
talk about this, is that the more biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: they use, the more food waste they can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food waste has a higher tipping fee,
so that helps their economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wind up making a richer compost that
they actually charge twice as much for
[SPEAKER_00]: compared with their regular compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by using, but they wind up with,
after composting, they wind up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: they advertise 16% biochar by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about 8% biochar by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're still back in that five to 10%
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be sort of a magic
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it not only just seems to be a magic
range, it's been very well documented and
[SPEAKER_00]: tested in multi-year trials and research
in Europe and here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: For someone who's really interested in
learning more, passionate about biochar,
[SPEAKER_03]: can you talk a little bit about how
someone might get involved with the
[SPEAKER_03]: International Biochar Initiative,
or IDI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have two organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the International Biochar
Initiative and we also have the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The International Biochar Initiative was
created back in 2007 with the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: developing standards and practices for the
use of biochar for carbon trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, we created the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative with the idea of
focusing primarily on the needs for the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of biochar in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to biochar-international.org
for the International Biochar Initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just Google International Biochar
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative is biochar-us.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative, we have a YouTube
channel with about 60 videos that we put
[SPEAKER_00]: together last December in what we call the
National Biochar Week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've held about seven conferences and one
virtual conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a monthly newsletter, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up for the newsletter on our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically a volunteer organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on donations and grants from
Forest Service and other sources for
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting the use of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work very closely with the
International Biochar Initiative and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work in an international
community, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very active biochar community in Australia
and in Europe and China and in Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting all these folks, I chaired the
International Biochar Initiative for about
[SPEAKER_00]: four years and for the last five years
I've chaired the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're slowly, our biggest challenge is
educating folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a biochar discussion group at
biochar at groups.io and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion list that I've hosted since
2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about a thousand people online and
some very knowledgeable and experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: people in biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenge with those listers or
discussion lists is always you have to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the question to get an answer and
sometimes you'll get answers from armchair
[SPEAKER_00]: experts who really don't know what they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a pretty high quality of
expertise and exchange on the list that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of ways by land or by sea of
getting the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we certainly welcome people to join us
at the International Biochar Initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a membership organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar Initiative which is basically just
an active community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure appreciate your work in promoting
this technology and renewable resource for
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be sure to put those links on the
podcast page as well for people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to staying in touch and
hearing what the future holds for biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly enjoy your participation and
promotion and so on of biochar and we
[SPEAKER_00]: think that everybody can benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love using it in our soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see such a difference in the quality of
the vegetables and other plants that we
[SPEAKER_03]: grow in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say enough good things about
biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think we'll ever stop using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well thanks again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will stay in touch and appreciate your
time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Tom Miles and you were listening
to the Cannabis Cultivation and Science
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget to check out the podcast page
at WWW K I S organics dot com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just click on the Learn tab then podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way we carry the black owl
biochar from biochar supreme which in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion is the highest quality most
researched and most consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially available biochar on the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've used it in our soil mixes for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now and also have it available by the
cubic foot bag or by the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for your support and happy growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
