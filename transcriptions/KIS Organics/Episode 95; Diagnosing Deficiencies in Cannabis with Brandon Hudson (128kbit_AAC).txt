[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My podcast this week is a bit unique in
that we will be discussing how to diagnose
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies in cannabis and how to use
the dichotomous key.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new document available on our
website at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just click on the learn tab and then blog
and it will be the first post.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will have the dichotomous key that we
reference in the podcast as well as images
[SPEAKER_02]: showing the deficiencies related to each
mineral we discuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to follow along to the
podcast with visuals, you can check it out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the website anytime as a free guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon is a second-generation cannabis
cultivator with over 35 years of direct
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up in East Tennessee with the
Great Smoky Mountains for a backyard,
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon can't remember a time that he
didn't love the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: His parents grew row crops and were
advocates of the 1970s back-to-the-land
[SPEAKER_02]: movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Building on fundamentals learned as a
child, Brandon has applied a controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: approach to cannabis cultivation starting
with his first plants his freshman year of
[SPEAKER_02]: college in 1986.
[SPEAKER_02]: He currently works for Kiss Organics
providing growers with everything from
[SPEAKER_02]: customer support to assistance with
nutrients and soil tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: A well-rounded and passionate organic
grower, Brandon's real passion is in soil
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, Brandon was the director of
cultivation and one of the four founding
[SPEAKER_02]: members of a minority-owned hemp flower
farm in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: He provided SOPs and oversight for all
aspects of cultivation from propagation to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest and cure including daily operation
of a large nursery facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this role, Brandon also performed
several federally funded hemp trials for
[SPEAKER_02]: HBCUs as well as research projects for
nutrient producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also worked with a group to develop
sterile gels for propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who has met Brandon knows he is
rarely as happy as when he is talking
[SPEAKER_02]: plants with other passionate growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a proud dad and husband who spends
his free time outdoors with his veggie
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens and chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Brandon, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's start off telling growers a
little bit about you and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to keep it brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that knows me has been victimized
by my chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep me on track if I go off script here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in East Tennessee, Smoky
Mountains with a twin brother and little
[SPEAKER_01]: sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent all of our childhood running
around in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a theme I hear with podcast
interviews actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like everybody that is on this
same track has always had some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: passion or love for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our parents were hippies in the 70s,
the whole back to the earth, back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: land movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing row crops and my mom was
canning and pickling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew up in the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is my real plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a professional horticulturist for
many years and maintained beautiful floral
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens still in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a little sister for Evergreen in
Virginia, the Carter Family Folds nurse.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got some funny stories about cussing
out Johnny Cash for parking his bus where
[SPEAKER_01]: she needed to move soil and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been around hippies and
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got into college and got into
Grateful Dead and that community really
[SPEAKER_01]: came full circle back into my life because
my dad grew, uncles grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: My entire family, they're that era,
they're that age where they were age in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s and they all smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 80s, that's the height of the Just
Say No era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody kind of took it underground and
got quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't on my radar, again,
in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like salt and pepper for dead heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just became a big part of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately, I was attracted to wanting to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal has that great quote about
how addictive the growing it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to concur with that
wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started trying and I had a little
astronomy knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first attempt home and my mom had found
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dead plants and the light in my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 years later, I just kept at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in those days, you had a couple of
books by Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Robert Connell Clark books.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad had a bunch of underground growing
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, you couldn't even take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Ohio State, I met a guy at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually hanging out with some
friends and a guy came in super straight
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody got really nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy started laughing and was like,
that's the real G.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody knows the G.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 history that was coming out of Dayton,
I got to meet that guy at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: He opened some doors for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard to get lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard to get a solid grip on
fertilizer regimens and that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: back in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me to a traditional cultivation
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in, not like a hydro store or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in and it looked like a mom and pop
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of nervous to say anything,
but I went up to the counter and said his
[SPEAKER_01]: password name was Bobby Brady because he
literally looked like Bobby Brady from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brady Bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I told him that Bobby Brady had
sent me, they sent a hippie looking kid
[SPEAKER_01]: out who took me into a back room and
showed me a bunch of grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was where I really got some of the
basics and just kept at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys really knew their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were conscious of IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew how to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just really lucky to meet those guys
and got the opportunity eventually to run
[SPEAKER_01]: a commercial facility in South Carolina
for four and a half, five years doing hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: flower on scale, knocking out 20,000
cuttings at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really got to fine tune everything
from propagation to harvest and cure on
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really great experience for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to work with a lot of local organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do some hemp trials for a HBCU in
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then eventually got to work at Kiss
Organics with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I am now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping clients and doing soil
reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to have you and you bring a
lot of experience to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to start off the podcast talking
about this idea of, from a grower's
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, how do you approach a grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you and I have had a conversation
about this, talking about limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you delve into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a great place to
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I do is answer a
lot of calls from not just beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, but growers who are getting
exposed to scale as cannabis has become
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of folks coming into it
without a strong tradition or traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomy background.
[SPEAKER_01]: To approach things on scale, it's really
important, I think, to start with a list
[SPEAKER_01]: of limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be your weak link
and that's going to be the thing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: slowing you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agronomy is so interesting, infinitely
interesting because it's not a closed
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's interactions with all the
different phases and interactions with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your PAR, your PPFD range,
your relative humidity, what's your water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, your irrigation events,
how do you water, what's the temp,
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM, pests, viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis growers are unfortunately
infamous for passing around viruses and
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the community is getting a
lot better about that and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to really understand that
quarantining and even things like tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: control and that kind of stuff are really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to dial in a metric for each one
of those limiting factors and nutrients is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky that it's not a closed system,
like I said, in controlled cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally controlled agriculture,
we can control a lot of the limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can optimize our production,
always looking at margins and input costs
[SPEAKER_01]: with one eye and your final harvest with
the other eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to optimize our growth because
we can control a lot of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me as an organic grower, the tricky
thing is the nutrients in your soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: organics, it's only been in the last 10,
15 years, but really 10 years where we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to get a basic NPK value for an
input and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made it really tricky for growers to
be 100% confident that they've got all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in that soil that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I know you do, I do,
I live and die by soil reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an experienced grower, I think it's
really important that you can physically,
[SPEAKER_01]: visually ID your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford to test every single
plant in a 12,000 square foot greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to read it visually
and determine if you've got environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, pest issues, pathogen issues,
watering issues, nutrients, and dial those
[SPEAKER_01]: things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can visually recognize them,
you can get ahead of them before it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast in particular is going to be
focused on nutrients and limiting factors
[SPEAKER_02]: with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a grower perspective, I think it's
important and I know when I go out and do
[SPEAKER_02]: consultations and things, I'm putting on a
detective's hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, I'm trying to figure out
what's the current limiting factor of
[SPEAKER_02]: growth because there's always something
that's going to be limiting the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned, it could be light,
it could be pests, it could be nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be water, it can be all of those,
any one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a grower, what I want to do is
eliminate as many variables as I can and
[SPEAKER_02]: then figure out which variable,
focus on one variable, the one that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is the one that's probably most key
to eliminating the lowest hanging fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially what the limiting factor is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once that's corrected, there'll be a
new limiting factor that I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe initially, for example, it's the way
that I'm watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm overwatering, I'm leaching nutrients,
I'm stressing the plant and killing root
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that's corrected, well, now I find
that maybe my light levels are a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit lower than they could be to be
optimized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm focused on raising my light
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after that, it may be something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always going through this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a nutrient perspective, something
that you and I have talked about quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit off air is if we're trying to diagnose
a nutrient problem and we know that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: indeed nutrients, it goes beyond just a
soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just take a soil test and know
everything that we need to know about a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a conversation with the
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know how did the plants
actually look because there are all these
[SPEAKER_02]: variables and genetics is one of the
biggest ones there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain plants that people are growing are
going to be more sensitive to nitrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or might need slightly more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no standard calculator that we
can use that's going to give us optimal
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can definitely point us in the right
direction, but it really is that
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with the grower or that the
grower needs to have with themselves to
[SPEAKER_02]: really figure out what's optimal for the
particular plants in their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want people to start thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then as we start narrowing it down,
then eliminating variables like I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to just using water,
clean water, rather than adding all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these other teas or KNF products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost done here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people will think, okay,
I want to get into KNF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start doing water soluble
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to take a step back and say,
does my plant actually need that calcium?
[SPEAKER_02]: If the soil is already high in calcium,
we may be compounding an already existing
[SPEAKER_02]: problem by raising pH, by eliminating
other cations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that conversation that growers need
to have in their heads or with a
[SPEAKER_02]: professional to really dial in their
cultivation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into what a dichotomous key is
and start talking about these nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they might display on a given
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we jump into that, I just want to
echo again what you just said about it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really important to take that holistic
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who lives and dies by soil
reports, I still know that there's no one
[SPEAKER_01]: calculator or there's no way to just put
your numbers into a spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick out what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is a favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have tons of calcium in your soil
and your relative humidity is too high and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to have any in your
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do have to take that holistic
thousand-foot view and look at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different factors and see what's your
target for that factor, how close are you
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do to move incrementally
towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to touch back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as a dichotomous key, like I said,
I've got 35, 36 years of active experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with cultivating that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to invariably start to learn
this is what wind burn on the leaf looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like or all the different environmental
and nutritional issues that you can run
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start to just know those just year
after year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got to the hemp farm and I had
people working for me and I wanted them to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to scout and trying to teach
somebody 35 years of memorization,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just doesn't work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted a path that somebody could
follow to make a decision and feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable about it that they were
dealing with a nutrient issue that they
[SPEAKER_01]: could narrow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dichotomous key is just, I think
everybody's used one in high school
[SPEAKER_01]: biology or on a field guide, but it
basically gives you a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go one direction or the other
depending on the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick scouting note, if it is
suspected that you've got a pest or a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, really first step is crucial is
getting that ID, having the right scopes
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of stuff to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular scouting and knowing where your
nutrient issue starts on your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first approach a canopy,
a quadrant, a cultivar, that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: issues I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see somebody's canopy and they'll
have certain number of plants of this
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar and a certain number of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really treat those as one
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to look at each cultivar as a
canopy to look for nutrient issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a dichotomous key, as far as
nutrients, the first thing, you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you need to determine is,
is that a nutrient issue or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either biotic, something living,
think pests and pathogens, or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: abiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got either a nutrient or an
environmental issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at a specific cultivar
or a specific area of your canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to see if you're seeing patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing an entire area affected,
you most likely have an abiotic issue if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one plant that affected and
then it jumps over to another one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably looking at something
that's biotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably got a pest that's jumped from
one plant, skipped over another one,
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped onto another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you've let a pest or pathogen
problem go way too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, if you're scouting,
you would know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've determined if you've got a
pattern or not, you can look at an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a dead area, like a necrotic
spot on a plant, it's just on one leaflet,
[SPEAKER_01]: on one leaf grouping, then that makes me
think, again, that you've got a biotic
[SPEAKER_01]: issue because it's not repeating
throughout the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you could fold that leaf over and
so you've got a marginal gallowing or
[SPEAKER_01]: necrosis or chlorosis, if you've got that
along the edge and that repeats throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, then you're pretty comfortable
that you've got an abiotic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either your environment or your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've determined that you've seen a
pattern and you know that you've got an
[SPEAKER_01]: abiotic issue and as a controlled grower,
you should have a pretty good idea of your
[SPEAKER_01]: targets for all of your limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're meeting those,
then you can feel pretty comfortable that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you would want to start
making use of the dichotomous key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the first step in the dichotomous
key is to determine if it's biotic or
[SPEAKER_01]: abiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next step would be to,
like I mentioned earlier, you really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to pay attention to where the
nutrient issue started on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it start at the bottom, the top,
or the whole plant all at once?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that's important is that
empowers you to know whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with a mobile element or an
immobile element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me if you want me to take a breath
here, but I'll just keep going through
[SPEAKER_01]: this if you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are looking at mobile and immobile
elements, obviously all elements are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be able to be brought into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about is can it be
translocated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the most important areas on the
plant are the apical points, the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tips and the root tips and the shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: For reproductive reasons and for growth
reasons, those are prioritized over the
[SPEAKER_01]: other tissue in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a mobile element,
you're going to see that show up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of your plant because it's going to
be sacrificed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be translocated to those
growing tips to keep them optimally
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an immobile element,
it can't be translocated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show up on those growing
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like calcium or phosphorus where
you need it for root development or flower
[SPEAKER_01]: development, you'll be able to determine
by looking at the symptoms on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: which ones you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could start with the mobile elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several of those that people are
very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen, obviously, is the nutrient issue
that we see the most in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily a bad thing, especially as
you're heading into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see your nitrogen numbers
taper down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really a deficiency that we
worry about, but that's a good way for a
[SPEAKER_01]: grower to know without a tissue sample
that his nitrogen is winding down as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're moving towards flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go through those mobile
nutrients, again, we've set it up as a
[SPEAKER_01]: dichotomous key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've decided you've got an abiotic
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've decided that the issue is started
on the bottom of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go with mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to start looking at visual
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of visual symptoms that are
going to be similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: A note as well, especially with a pH or
irrigation problem, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to just see one symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your roots are damaged, it's not just
nitrogen that's not getting into your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing a bunch of stuff going
haywire, check that pH first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing just some yellowing at
the bottom of your plant, some chlorosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nitrogen or phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty easy to differentiate those a
couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got leaf abscission,
meaning that if you give a lower leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: that's yellow, if you give it a little tug
or a little snap, it'll pop right off the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the leaf is just yellow and falling
off, you've got nitrogen issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant is a dark green and the lower
leaf yellowing begins to go necrotic on
[SPEAKER_01]: the tips and they don't pop off,
then you've got phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another phosphorus clue, don't be afraid
to pull a plant out of a pot, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: on scale if you're using smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop some out and look at those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got short, clubby roots,
you may have a phosphorus issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus, everybody is always talking
about how purpling has a sign for
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and sometimes potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to warn folks that that's not
always the smoking gun that it might seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to be based on cultivar, based on
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those anthocyanins can build up,
sugars can build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that can make that
purpling happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the chlorosis on the lower
leaves, you're looking at nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some ways to determine which one
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you were looking at lower leaves
and you get the tiger striping,
[SPEAKER_01]: the interveinal chlorosis, you get that
lack of pigment between the veins,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one of the easiest to diagnose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to prove it to yourself and remedy
it is with an Epson foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you don't want to spray
anything on a flowering plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in veg, you can go ahead and do a one
tablespoon to one gallon spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have results within 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really easy way to know that that
was a magnesium issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium, everybody's seen potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about the margin,
the edge of the leaf, if you see yellowing
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorosis coming in on the margins and
then quickly going to necrosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got as a band, not just the tips,
but as a band along the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edge of the leaf, it's really,
really solid evidence that you're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the potassium issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's once you've scouted and
eliminated pests and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you a really easy way to see
the bottom of the plant and those mobile
[SPEAKER_01]: elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I jump in real quick, Brandon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two thoughts I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first was with potassium, the other
clue I see is when I talk to a grower and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, man, my plant looks really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run this cultivar before and I'm just
not getting that bulking density that I
[SPEAKER_02]: normally see in a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when I see a soil test associated
with that, we find low potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy clue also to watch for with
potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I differ a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I push potassium a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I push potassium a little bit higher than
a lot of growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is I feel like you get a payoff
at harvest for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on board with that 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a lot of the PK boosters
that are marketed in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, it's really the K that's the
driver there more than the P in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and potassium I think are the real
secret to strong flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that phosphorus, but we could get
into that whole rabbit hole some other
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm following along here on the blog post
and folks can do that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about this at the beginning of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about for a canopy where you've
removed a lot of your lower leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking you've trellised your
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use for clues when you don't
have that lower canopy to look at as much?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously a very common practice
before a flip, before flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different names for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colloquially, we call it lollipopping,
but basically trim out the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to remove a lot of your lower
leaves, obviously, and that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to open up airflow and it's
going to limit the number of budding sites
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can get a more marketable
product and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience has always been that if you
have a nutrient deficiency, the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves on your plant, regardless of where,
almost like I was thinking about it in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of a perched water table,
it doesn't really matter where you move
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the leaf symptoms happening in those
bottom most leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's close to what I was getting
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've removed, let's say, the bottom
eight inches of the plant and all those
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, then essentially your nitrogen
deficiency, if it's showing up,
[SPEAKER_02]: would start or your phosphorous would
start with whatever that bottom leaf is,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's eight inches up where your
canopy starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to get that into the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minimum canopy I ever see is a 12-inch
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still enough to give you lower
leaves that you could use for visually
[SPEAKER_01]: sleuthing out a symptom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to let you keep going through
this, but I see a lot of people online
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about or having trouble
distinguishing between calcium and
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium in terms of leaf damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you maybe touch on a little bit on
how to distinguish the two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I would add that you can also do a
soil drench with epsom salt, since you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also do that with a salt drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium deficiencies in substrate growing
is something that I see a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways that you
can have a calcium deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have plenty of calcium in your
soil, but because it travels primarily in
[SPEAKER_01]: the xylem, if your transpiration rates are
messed up, high relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you won't get it into
the tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and magnesium differ in that
magnesium is going to show up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium versus calcium on the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the easiest ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is famous for that interveinal
chlorosis, the tiger striping,
[SPEAKER_01]: but again, at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some of that interveinal
chlorosis with calcium, but it would be up
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I see calcium issues on plants,
I see necrosis and distortion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is responsible for the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have it, like in tomatoes,
blossom inrod, or apples, you get apple
[SPEAKER_01]: scab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that is is just a lack of calcium,
so you've got a weak cell structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's grown a cultivar they're
used to, and then the next round,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're low on calcium, they'll get
almost this viney growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get really long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't support itself, and then come
flower, you've got lower flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's lowered flower,
they can't support the weight of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just kind of falling all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium, I also ... No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to add, it looks like ...
I'm referencing also between our
[SPEAKER_02]: dichotomous key, the one that you put
together and we're offering, also in
[SPEAKER_02]: conjunction with Paul Coxon's paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Paul on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: People should definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Characterization of Nutrient
Disorders of Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: From looking at his photos, it also
appears that calcium starts more at the
[SPEAKER_02]: base of the leaf, whereas magnesium,
you get more of an interveinal chlorosis
[SPEAKER_02]: across the entire leaf based on his
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another telltale sign that
you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where exactly did that chlorosis start?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got it more on the tip or on the
little serrations along the margin up top,
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately I'm going to start thinking
calcium, but if I've got tan speckling
[SPEAKER_01]: larger areas, I might be dealing with
manganese up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then calcium is kind of famous for that
windburned look where the edges are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go necrotic on you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron, one of its telltale signs is ...
Iron you can kind of see sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the entire plant, but typically
it starts up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody's seen it and maybe just
not even recognized what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when somebody contacts me about young
plants especially and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: my plants look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new growth is always really light
towards the petiole end of the leaf and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's iron usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing where it starts on the plant,
but then also on the leaf can help you
[SPEAKER_01]: dial in what nutrients you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can iron look like light bleaching?
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron can actually go ... That's one of the
symptoms of iron and especially in some
[SPEAKER_01]: row crops like grapes and things like
that, if you have an iron issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can go all the way to white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start off as chlorotic looking pale
lime green and then it goes chlorotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: turns yellow, but then if you've got a
serious iron issue, it can look like
[SPEAKER_01]: bleaching just because the tips will go
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole leaves will go white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to have a pretty severe
iron deficiency, but I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is another one that's hard to ...
Without chelators and that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: without humics and bulbics, you can have
iron issues, especially at low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: When diagnosing a plant, what you're
saying essentially is it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important to not only have a photo or take
a close look at the leaf itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also look at where that leaf is
located on the plant and also have a photo
[SPEAKER_02]: of the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way a person could really,
I would say, effectively diagnose a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: off of just one photo of a leaf on a
forum, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people post a picture of a leaf all
the time and then everyone writes Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it might be ... It happens all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This idea then is that we really need to
see the entire plant and then also know
[SPEAKER_02]: where on that leaf or where on that plant
the leaf was located to really start
[SPEAKER_02]: dialing in what the limiting factor is,
what the nutrient deficiency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I ask somebody when
somebody contacts me and says,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a plant and it has an issue,
the first thing I do is I send them a
[SPEAKER_01]: little questionnaire about limiting
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually not expecting to get
questions back to their question,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really helps us dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want photos and I want photos of
the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's on scale canopy, I'd like to see
photos of the canopy so I can look for
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really difficult to discern this
stuff in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disturbing it from photos, like Suzanne,
if you send her a grainy photo of what
[SPEAKER_01]: might be an aphid and ask for help,
you're not going to get ... You're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get scolded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're going to learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's to take really good, precise images
because that's how you empower that person
[SPEAKER_01]: to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody can note, first and foremost,
where on the planet it started,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then within that issue, did it start
at the petiole closest to the stem or did
[SPEAKER_01]: it start on the tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really important to help us
guide what the issue is because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to determine what the issue is
without being able to scope, without being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have tissue, without being able to
have soil reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to do the best we can for
folks and set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to the more
information they can give us, the better
[SPEAKER_01]: job we can do figuring out what their
issue is.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the keys, I would say, or clues is
if you have a soil report that shows that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have sufficiency of nutrients in that
soil, you've used good inputs to know that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have good biology in there that's
going to cycle the nutrients, and your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant still doesn't look the way you want
it to, well, then at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, it's usually pretty clear that
it's probably a watering issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that Don Marshall talked
about in his podcast that I like to remind
[SPEAKER_02]: folks of is just how important watering
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you over or under water, you're
having the same effect in the plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're killing root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you kill root hairs, the plant does
not have the ability to uptake nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: to the same effect that it would have
prior to the root hair death.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can display deficiencies even if there
is sufficient nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the first places I like to
start when talking about deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_02]: is make sure that the watering is correct
and you're not massively over or under
[SPEAKER_02]: watering because you can apply all the
nutrients in the world from an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, and they just won't be
available to the plant until we correct
[SPEAKER_02]: the watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an old greenhouse adage that the
most important person in the greenhouse is
[SPEAKER_01]: the person holding the hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I would bring somebody on and start
working them into a workflow, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing I would do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people would feel insulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give them a water hose,
with a water breaker head on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and explain the importance of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get good flow and you're not
compacting the soil and blasting spores up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the air and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they would expect me to just cut
them loose, and I would spend weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: standing there with them, watching them
water enormous canopies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it is the single most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what style of cultivation,
what form of nutrients you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not watering appropriately,
you are definitely going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number one reason for lost
crops in greenhouse growing, is irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not pests, not pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's operator error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your water dialed in and really
knowing your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same way that you're saying,
if you've armed yourself with a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: report and you notice a nutrient issue,
that's something that becomes experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are monitoring your water,
and most organic growers are growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: larger smart pots or raised beds so that
they have a bigger ecosystem that can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: up with the plant's needs, it's pretty
easy to put a blue matte water sensor or,
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say brands, but if you have a
water meter with a ceramic tip that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to measure that osmotic pressure,
you'll be able to dial in at this millibar
[SPEAKER_01]: metric, my plants are absolutely in
heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go this direction, they don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about data and being able to
associate those visual clues back to that
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some ways to, like you mentioned
with magnesium for example, Epsom salts,
[SPEAKER_02]: an easy way to see a visual change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we know that we are low in a
particular mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we go about, once we've done the
diagnosis, we know we're not causing a big
[SPEAKER_02]: issue with our irrigation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we go about correcting a nutrient
issue or mineral issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different ways you can
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways you can
go about it obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, you just said you've
diagnosed an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the important thing that you do in
all scientific experiments?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a control.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to verify for yourself,
that you have figured out what the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: is and that you can correct it,
you want to add that nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: that element.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's dealing with trace elements,
sometimes it's better just to add a one
[SPEAKER_01]: and done amendment, something like glacial
rock dust or kelp that's got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals in it as opposed to trying
to put that one trace element back in
[SPEAKER_01]: there because that's really touchy and a
lot of times you can do more damage trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to add an individual trace element back
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go that route with the trace
elements, but with my micros and macros,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really easy to get a sulfate of just
about anything and you can add that back
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for your nitrogen, your phosphorus,
your potassium, I would add a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment, usually something at fine
particle size with a lot of surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: that's more soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're suspecting something like
phosphorus, make sure you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus solubilizing bacteria in your
beds, in your pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're saying, you want to make sure
that whatever it is is available and that
[SPEAKER_01]: requires your microbes in your soil to get
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've determined whatever element it
is, you want to add that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: element and then wait for a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are faster than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that magnesium response is really
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus or potassium is a little slower
reaction usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium usually responds pretty quickly to
a foliar in veg and then ag lime as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to something slow releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give some people some suggestions,
like with calcium, you mentioned ag lime,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is very soluble, works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can raise your pH, will add carbonates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to think about a lot of different
things when deciding what to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gypsum, there's some water soluble gypsum,
calcium sulfate that works really well in
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of cases too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of potassium, if I need it
late in flower and I need it quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some really good potassium sulfate
options, 0050.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to give you a lot of potassium
and you can water that in really easily to
[SPEAKER_02]: a flowering crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nitrogen and phosphorus are a
little more complicated from an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, but there's some options
there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is the hardest to manage,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where some people may have issue,
but fish hydrolysis is stabilized with
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphoric acid, which is a very available
form of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, we just saw a soil
test where the grower had been using
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphoric acid in their greenhouse to
lower the pH of their water and we saw off
[SPEAKER_02]: the charts available phosphorus,
like numbers that I hadn't seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower had just switched from using
sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very obvious on the soil test and
I thought that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very available source of
phosphorus too, depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable using and if it makes sense in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just knowing, I think being educated as a
grower as to how available these nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are is also an important part of this
whole dichotomous key process for
[SPEAKER_02]: correcting any issue you may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like you mentioned, if I have an
issue with calcium, and I'm midway through
[SPEAKER_02]: flower and I put out granulated gypsum and
water that in, well, I may not be getting
[SPEAKER_02]: a noticeable effect in raising calcium for
the plant in a timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that folks have to make
those decisions, like with the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: workaround.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important that people know
that that's an option and you can maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: an OMRI certification if you do that
because it has to be an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: In there to stabilize the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are workarounds on certain things
and it really just comes down to what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're comfortable with and your goals as
far as how close you can move to
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to put in a note right here
on those same lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying, what should I add?
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing that somebody can add is a
shotgun approach where they start throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of different things at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The absolute worst thing they could do is
use an unknown product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product I see people using the most
and causing the most problems is very
[SPEAKER_01]: well-intentioned, but I see a lot of folks
that top dress with local compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: By local compost, I mean compost that they
produced or a friend produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that has not been tested for its
nutrients, hasn't been tested for tests
[SPEAKER_01]: and pathogens, something that hasn't been
tested for seed and weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some compost that somebody made
and it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brown and it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells good, but it could have heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have incredibly high sodium
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I really encourage people
to do is if you see an issue, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contact me and I'm not going to
charge you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everybody to be as well-armed and
as empowered in their garden as they can
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody can contact me and say,
hey, I've got this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about adding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell them, oh, that's a great idea
or I could tell them, you might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at this option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might work a little bit better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could cause an antagonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could start with one problem and
create a lot more problems by using
[SPEAKER_01]: unknown products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to add too, phosphoric acid is not
the only way to raise P. I don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: guanine.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we've had good
success with is mammoth P and having
[SPEAKER_02]: something like you mentioned that
P-solidizing microbes is a good way to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that P more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a good option if you
wanted to stay fully organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to make it sound like it's
not hard to get phosphorus into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to get it available to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using something like the mammoth P
eliminates that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep it in sufficiency for you
throughout the full term of your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I just want to touch on is
as a soil producer ourselves, from time to
[SPEAKER_02]: time, we do see people that are having
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like to do is go through this
process, the one we just talked about with
[SPEAKER_02]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's things that we know about our soil
because we've seen so many soil tests of
[SPEAKER_02]: our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that as a grower in a small
container, the first things that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to run out of is nitrogen and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense too because it's more
mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to be sufficient in phosphorus and
calcium even in a slightly smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the things you mentioned is
that a larger container just offers more
[SPEAKER_02]: buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can only fit so much nutrients into a
given volume of soil and that corrects a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there, just going into a larger
volume or larger container.
[SPEAKER_02]: But contacting your soil provider is a
good resource for you too because like I
[SPEAKER_02]: said, Brandon, and myself and Ben will
work with a grower to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any soil provider should be able to offer
you that same service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what some of these other
commercial soils may be high or low in
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to say our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know pretty well how our soil will
perform in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of all the tests I've seen
and we've been doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to suggest that to folks as a
resource that they should absolutely be
[SPEAKER_02]: utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every company should provide you with a
soil test, heavy metals, organic
[SPEAKER_02]: certification, whatever sort of
information you need to make the right
[SPEAKER_02]: decision about your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of offering soil in my
opinion commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to add,
Brandon?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to help and help people move
towards sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need a resource, like you said with
the soil reports, we've seen so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody says they think that they're
seeing a magnesium deficiency and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're running LEDs, then I've seen
a certain number of soil reports where
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium is low in flour with certain
brands of LEDs even.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many correlations and
relationships to environment and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to 90 years of prohibition,
we're now able to gather data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can write things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old joke in the lab is the difference
between science and screwing around is
[SPEAKER_01]: writing it down on a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take advantage of people who've been doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask them questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're getting qualified.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forums are a great way to exchange
information and pick other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two heads are always better than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that both those heads are
grounded in standard scientific practices
[SPEAKER_01]: and can give you action steps based on
data as opposed to just a gut instinct
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing because that's where you can
get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you go on a forum and you post a
question and you'll get 30 different
[SPEAKER_02]: answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll all fight to the death.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll all be different.
I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you get what you pay for with
forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some forums I'm in that have some
very intelligent people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Suzanne, for example, will answer
bug questions on occasion in some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: forums that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you can take that as gold,
but rarely do I see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you get what you pay for with
forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can definitely give you a new
perspective, but you still, at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day, are the one who is responsible
and liable for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to make the decisions based off
of good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that in mind, since you're the one
responsible, especially for on-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, if you have a stockholder that
you have to answer to, don't ever apply a
[SPEAKER_01]: new product to your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply it to a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things go well, then you can start
applying it to two plants, but don't ever
[SPEAKER_01]: jump with both feet into a new process or
a new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just protect yourself and ease into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you know what limiting
factors you can lock in and find that one
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're trying to adjust and make an
incremental change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always go in at half strength and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's sound advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all your time today,
Brandon, for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks will be able to check out this
dichotomous key on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also put a link to Paul's paper
available too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's freely available for folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, these will be good resources
for people moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrilled to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it can help some growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they need clarification or help,
they can reach out to me at KISS.
