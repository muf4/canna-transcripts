[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this week's podcast, I had the honor
of interviewing Dr. Nadia Sava,
[SPEAKER_02]: also known as Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the president and founder of Dr.
Greenhouse Incorporated, an agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: and mechanical engineering firm that
specializes in the design of HVAC systems
[SPEAKER_02]: for indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Sava has her PhD in agricultural
engineering from the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona's Controlled Environment
Agricultural Center, and she is a licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical engineer in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: For over 20 years, she has dedicated her
education and career to helping farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: control their environments, allowing them
to grow crops indoors, in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in facilities that would otherwise be
impossible or impractical.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this week's episode, we talk about a
variety of topics ranging from VPD to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant transpiration to optimizing your
drying and curing environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Nadia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always enjoy my conversations with
you, and I wanted to start off just
[SPEAKER_02]: chatting a little bit about what you've
been up to since the last time we talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I feel like so much has happened
since the last time we talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think the last time you and I
really, really talked was the last
[SPEAKER_00]: conference that I went to before the
pandemic started, which was the Indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture Energy Conference in San Diego
back in February of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a super cool conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great content, great people,
and great to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: with people like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, we've been doing pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with COVID and the pandemic,
since you and I saw each other in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego, we've hired two more engineers,
full-time engineers, so we are now a
[SPEAKER_00]: staff, including myself, of four
engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hired a marketing person,
and we have, you know, our admin staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are seven strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, so we've been growing over the
last year, year and a half, so that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are approaching, I think, 150 projects
since I started Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually celebrating our fifth
year, so we officially, January 1st of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022 will be five years since starting Dr.
Greenhouse, first as a sole prop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as a corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing to think that,
you know, I started by myself five years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and now I have a staff of seven,
and we continue to grow and work on
[SPEAKER_00]: projects all over the country and
spattering around the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in cannabis, as well as leafy greens
and berries and tomatoes and all other
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of plants you can think of that
people are trying to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended, you know, my first conference
in a year and a half live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Cannabis Conference last
month, and it was so great to see people
[SPEAKER_00]: and catch up with people, and it was,
you know, I like that event a lot just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's very educational and content,
a lot of great people, and we actually did
[SPEAKER_00]: a podcast we posted just a couple weeks
ago where I talked to people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit floor and asked them a couple
questions about the state of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they learned at the conference,
and it's really fascinating because out
[SPEAKER_00]: of, I think, what, the seven or eight
people that we talked to, everybody had a
[SPEAKER_00]: different response, had different
thoughts, and so I just love hearing all
[SPEAKER_00]: those different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's what we've been up to,
you know, just busy getting more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, a lot more repeat clients,
which, you know, is always a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means we're doing something right,
and just meeting a lot of great people,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's remote, but it's kind of
fun because you get to see people's fur
[SPEAKER_00]: babies and real babies, and yeah,
it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so wonderful to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I hear people talk about
HVAC, I hear your name come up a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: even by other HVAC experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's wonderful to have you back on the
podcast, and it's wonderful to hear that
[SPEAKER_02]: people are finding out about the services
that you offer and that you're expanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the things I just want to
touch on here and will have in the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: links is that you are doing a podcast as
well, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people should definitely check
that out, and I'll have that on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast page, and then you're also doing
these webinars that are free for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: listen in and learn about a lot of these
topics, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly suggest people check that out
as a great resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so beyond that, one of the
things you and I had just talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: prior to recording here was, you know,
VPD and how that's such a buzzword still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we talked about last podcast,
but, you know, I think reviewing it and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of expanding on it a little bit would
be a great place to start the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll kind of let you take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, vapor pressure deficit is
somewhat of a, I don't know, a difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter to wrap our brains around,
but it is so important in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: health of our plants, whether you're
growing outside or in a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant transpiration rates, plant quality,
their nutrient delivery is all really
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a nutshell, what VPD is,
is it's the difference between what the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure is inside the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're in an indoor grow room
and you have a specific temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that temperature and humidity,
you have a vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vapor pressure deficit is what is
the vapor pressure of the room compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the saturation vapor pressure at that same
air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're really trying to figure out
is sort of how dry the air is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to think about it is the
word is the key word, which is pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the vapor pressure is,
the more pressure we're putting on a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaporate water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with humans, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a high vapor pressure deficit,
if it's dry, let's say we're in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California and we're in a pool and we get
out of the pool and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel cool immediately because that
water is evaporating from our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we have a pretty high vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry compared to what the temperature
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were in, say, Florida,
you know, you travel 3000 miles due east,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity is so much higher that the
vapor pressure deficit is so much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: that that water takes a lot longer to
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the same exact thing with
plants is that, you know, at the stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: is liquid water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pulled water from its roots and it's
transported it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's up to the stem and it's up to the
leaf and into the stomata and it's liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: water and it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the pressure that the air
is putting on it, depending on how dry
[SPEAKER_00]: that air is, that's how quickly the plant
is going to then evaporate and transpire
[SPEAKER_00]: that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason VPD is so important is this
idea of transpiration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bigger the VPD is, the faster the
plant's going to transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the VPD is, the slower the plant
is going to transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transpiration is so critical to the
plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration helps with, of course,
transporting water from the roots all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that water are the nutrients coming
from the soil or from the substrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that water is carrying nutrients to all
the different plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't have transpiration,
there'd be no way to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those nutrients coming from these
beautiful soils to the other plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps cool the plant through that
evaporative cooling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also helps a little bit with
photosynthesis just because we need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of that, you know, hydrogen
molecule to create those carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, during photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transpiration and VPD are so closely
linked and, you know, if you have a low
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of transpiration, then what you might
see is that plants could wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis might be slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if your transpiration
rate is too high, if the VPD is so,
[SPEAKER_00]: so high that, you know, in the room or the
air is so dry, then transpiration could be
[SPEAKER_00]: so quick that if, you don't have enough
water at the roots in the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, then your plant will dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start to see your
plant will because there's not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: water for the plant to pull up through it
and then evaporate into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that you can get
nutrient deficiencies if the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: transpire too quickly, including,
and probably the biggest one is calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is transported with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the water literally is moving,
at a velocity too quick to carry this
[SPEAKER_00]: large calcium molecule with it,
then you'll see calcium deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is usually seen by sort of like
these brown edges along the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most susceptible to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, VPD and transpiration,
plant health, plant growth, all super
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love hearing, you know, I just
mentioned that I was at this conference
[SPEAKER_00]: last month and the number of people that
talked about VPD or that VPD was just in
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation, just in their,
you know, their lingo has increased so
[SPEAKER_00]: much since I started sort of preaching
about VPD a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just so, I'm glad to hear HVAC
manufacturers talking about VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers talking about VPD, monitoring and
controls companies talking about using VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: as a metric to, you know, to monitor and
manage the room environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely becoming part of our
everyday language, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be great for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that made me think about a couple of
different things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about transpiration,
you want it to be sufficient to where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not causing the plant to work too
hard, which would limit your plant growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also not too slow that you have water
or humidity in the air that could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially lead to pathogen issues too,
like mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when, when the humidity is
high, that means that the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that when the humidity is
high, that, you know, mold tends to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mold, you know, it has a high water
activity when, when the humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a stressed plant or you have
a drying plant, I would say that a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've chopped and are now putting in
a dry room, that that's a pretty stressed
[SPEAKER_00]: situation for that branch because it has
lost its, you know, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's, it's major body part
moving water through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as it's, it's desiccating,
as it's drying, you know, if we don't drop
[SPEAKER_00]: that humidity pretty low and we don't drop
the moisture out of that plant fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, then, you know, molds are gonna
be like, oh, hey, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like this, you know, really
stressed out plant that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: still has parts of it living as it's
gasping for its last breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take advantage of it and grow
there for a living plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, if the humidity is too high
and the vapor pressure deficit is too low,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what can actually happen because
there's not enough pressure to evaporate
[SPEAKER_00]: the water from the stomata, is that that
liquid water that the plant has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lifted to the leaf and to the
stomata opening can stay, can just sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have this exposed water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's not a droplet
necessarily, but you have this mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: that's open, ready to breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can now become a place where mold
can find, you know, a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if the VPD is so high
and the room is so dry, so you're afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of molds growing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're afraid of having too much moisture
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're afraid of condensation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And mold growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're like, okay, I'm gonna pull
as much moisture out of the air as quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna create a really dry
environment so that those molds can't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what ends up happening is that the
plant gets really strong and then it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you have a stressed out plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know, and I think
growers, cannabis growers inherently know
[SPEAKER_00]: this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of them will try to drop the
temperature, try to drop the humidity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last week or two of the flowering
plants life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're doing, whether they
realize it or not, is stressing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so it thinks it's going to die because it
is about to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that causes it, right, to create more
trichomes and terpenes and colors and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those, you know, beautiful aesthetic
things that we're trying to get out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do that too soon, then the plant
is stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now these mold spores are like,
hey, I can take advantage of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your immune system is compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, like there's not as
many places for me to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I do land and I do find,
you know, a nice spot, I'm going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growers don't necessarily realize
that it's not just high humidity that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be detrimental to their plants and cause
mold growth and disease, but it's also low
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity that can do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is actually really
interesting in that it actually propagates
[SPEAKER_00]: in or it actually transports its spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through dry air, the spores do need like a
moist surface in order to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they need it to be dry in order to
move from one location to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you manage, you know, I just imagine
imagine a cannabis, you know, grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really dry and you have all these
circulation fans that are blowing air
[SPEAKER_00]: around and creating air movement,
helping with treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration and help break up the
boundary layer across the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you just moved, you know,
mold spores, powdery mildew mold spores
[SPEAKER_00]: from one place to the rest of your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's just say you don't have the
best control as you switch from lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: to lights off and you get a humidity
spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just blew all those spores everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you created, you know,
inadvertently an environment where those
[SPEAKER_00]: mold spores are going to be super happy to
propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you don't just have a problem in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a problem everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I want, I want growers to know
that, you know, too dry can be just as
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental to the quality of your plant
and disease control as is too high of a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing you touched on there from a
transpiration perspective was this idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies showing in the plant due to
its ability to transpire either too high
[SPEAKER_02]: or too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I've talked about in
previous podcasts, like the one with Don
[SPEAKER_02]: Marshall that I thought was interesting is
the idea of root hair death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both too much water in the soil and too
little in the water soil causes root hair
[SPEAKER_02]: death, which creates the same symptoms in
the fact that the plant can no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively take up water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to present fairly
similar, even though the causes are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, both water related, but on,
on two extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just wanted to remind folks of
that because I think that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having soil, having a substrate
that's, that's overwatered, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You prevent oxygenation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is using CO2, but your,
your roots are, you know, are using
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have air gaps,
then your roots are going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if there's no water,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have this high VPD,
you have this dry room that you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are just going to wilt and
fall over because there's no water to
[SPEAKER_00]: transpire and lift them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that, that is one of the other
reasons why transpiration is so important
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for non non woody plants is that they
actually hold the plant up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what we're seeing when,
when leaves wilt is that there's no,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we're losing water in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the trunk of that plant is being
held up through the hydrogen bonds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water moving through that plant through
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there's no bark, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no wood that's holding that plant
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is water that's holding that plant up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first signs of, of not having
water is first, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves dry out, but if your plant
starts to fall over, you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've probably passed the wilting
point and you're not going to recover that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, you know, when you're,
one question I had is when you're thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about VPD, there's a lot of variables that
create the temperature and humidity in a
[SPEAKER_02]: room, which all relate to this ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your main variables that you're
looking at when we talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, controlled environment agriculture,
you know, really anything from say biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: to media, um, you know, bringing in air
and, you know, exiting air.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, how do all those relationships
work together and how do you approach
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, you know, as an engineer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every variable when growing a
plant is interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: With another variable or multiple
variables, you know, as, as an HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical engineer, we are pretty focused
on, you know, the aerial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment of the air around the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to control temperature and
humidity and favor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, so that we can control, uh,
you know, transpiration, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the air affects the leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which affects the rate of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, we, VPD is,
is not, um, mutually exclusive from
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity, and they're not
necessarily exclusive from themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're, you know, they all sort of
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and beyond that, the other
parameters that we're interested in to
[SPEAKER_00]: control plant growth, um, around the air
is it's carbon dioxide because plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can't photosynthesize without,
without CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as well as, as the light environment
and the quality of, of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the quality of the air includes,
you know, does it have pests and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, are there, you know, dust particles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Odor, um, is another air quality measure
that we help growers control and mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: through our designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and although we don't design lights,
uh, our HVAC designs are incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on the type and quantity and
intensity of the lights that growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: using, uh, to cultivate their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is the number one load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming that you're in a building that is
well insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an indoor facility,
then the primary load is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary load by load.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, heat gain to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is going to be from the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then your primary, you know,
dehumidification load is coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're in a greenhouse,
it's actually kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the lights, it's sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, solar radiation accounts for
65 to 70% of the total heat gain,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, you still have plants
transpiring and maybe you have water
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporating from from the soil,
from the media, uh, to account for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, if we can get pretty
much 90%, 85 to 90% of the way there with
[SPEAKER_00]: our HVAC designs and equipment selections,
if we know what the lights are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we know what, what plants you're
growing and how much you're going to water
[SPEAKER_00]: them and how frequently you're going to
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, light carbon dioxide and
temperature are three variables that are
[SPEAKER_00]: so essential to plant, uh, growth and
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually a lot of research going
on, uh, academic research specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: around lettuce plants and tomato plants
and all these other horticultural crops
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can study at the university level
that's getting federal funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to figure out how to co-optimize these
three variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it, it, because every plant
has an optimum, it has a curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, where as you increase the temperature,
photosynthesis increases and then it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: some peak and then it starts to drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you see a similar curve when it
comes to carbon dioxide, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the point at which all three of
those peaks intersect together,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the optimal point at which we want
to grow our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every plant has a different peak for
each of those three variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what you would see for lettuce would
look different than what you would see for
[SPEAKER_00]: basil, than what you would see for
cucumber, then what you would see for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably cannabis sativa versus cannabis
indica versus, you know, the thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and, and genetics, uh,
genetic crossbreeds that there are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and that's one of the reasons why
cannabis is so challenging is because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so many strains and cultivars
out there that it's hard to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what the optimal point is for those three
specific variables for every single one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think something that would help
this industry a lot would be to just find
[SPEAKER_00]: like five or 10 strains that everybody
loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody agrees on is available to
everyone and we could just optimize,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the control variables for those and
then start playing with all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, aside from that,
what kind of drives me crazy sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: when I talk to certain cannabis growers is
this lack of understanding of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the interactions between these three
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'll walk into a room and you know,
they'll have, you know, a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they'll be running their CO2 at
1500 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're trying to control to a
temperature of 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what they're doing is that
they're hitting the accelerator and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brake at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, say what you want to say about
the research coming out of Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we know it's a crappy strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's super old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and nobody grows this, this,
uh, this type of cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there is a study that came
out that said, you know, really the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal temperature for cannabis is around
80 or 82 degrees, but I rarely see growers
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know why they're doing it because if the
AC system went down, right, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at 80 or 82 degrees,
you only have a few degrees of movement
[SPEAKER_00]: really at 85 degrees, you know,
that the plant just shuts down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if, if you are uncertain about your
AC equipment operating when you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lamps and at 82
degrees and you're, you think that your AC
[SPEAKER_00]: system could break down, then yeah,
running your room at 75 degrees so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have sort of this 10 degree window to,
to make a fix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a temporary solution in there until
you can get a compressor replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I get that, that risk assessment,
but with the technology that we now have
[SPEAKER_00]: today, you know, versus 10 or 15 years
ago, um, we should have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence in our HVAC equipment to keep
operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if our temperature is at 80 or 82
degrees, you know, if, if, if every room,
[SPEAKER_00]: if these cannabis facilities were using
thousand watts, 80 degree temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500 parts per million, I mean,
I think the yields would, would skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they would be so much higher and,
and growers who I've talked to that are
[SPEAKER_00]: toeing that line that are trying to
optimize those three variables together
[SPEAKER_00]: are having really successful results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I want to say about raising that
temperature, if there's a grower out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like, okay, you know, I'm going to
play with raising the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing at 75 degrees and 50% relative
humidity right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to adjust to 77 degrees,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel comfortable at two degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: My AC unit hasn't failed on me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they raise the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also be raising the relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every degree increase in
temperature that, that you add to your
[SPEAKER_00]: target room set point, you should increase
the relative humidity by three to 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are growing at 75 degrees and
50% relative humidity, and now you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go up to 77, you should probably be closer
to, you know, 60% relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: 68, 70% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're going to hit 80 degrees,
this is a scary number for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but if you're at 80 degrees,
you should probably be closer to 65 or 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's scary, but that's a VPD of
one to one point two kilopascals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the sweet spot for healthy,
productive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want to stress your plant
and chill it at the end and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: depleted of water and nitrogen and all
these things that you do to stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at the end of the light,
at the end of life, yes, I get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lower the, lower the
temperature, lower the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it feel like it's, you know,
late fall and humble, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant is going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during your normal production,
target a higher temperature, target a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is going to be so healthy that
those molds that you're concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to have, you know,
a place to, to, to grow because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be healthy and it's going to
be able to fight those, those diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anecdotally, uh, a good friend of
mine, uh, Justin McGill, he had a employee
[SPEAKER_02]: who accidentally, uh, I don't remember
exactly how it happened, but essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: had a huge humidity spike in his room,
uh, for a period of time before he caught
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, his, his employee, but his name
was Buster, um, did this accidentally in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in this medical room and the plants
just took off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they, he started calling it swamp
mode because essentially that higher
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, higher temperature, uh,
in veg really led to, like you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: much healthier plants and they weren't
seeing powdery mildew take, or just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, relation to what you're,
what you're alluding to in this idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants are healthier too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't think humidity is
something we necessarily have to be afraid
[SPEAKER_02]: of as much as we have been, um,
you know, 15, 20 years ago when people
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing in their basements and
closets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think we have a better understanding
of it, but, but one of the things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about that I think I just want to
reiterate is this idea of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the massive genetic diversity that we're
seeing in cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about a commercial
facility, you know, they may have upwards
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, 20 or more different cultivars in a
given room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so trying to optimize that room for
all the cultivars is really impossible
[SPEAKER_02]: because of that diversity and each one
liking slightly different optimal points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to hit a target that work for,
you know, as many plants as possible in
[SPEAKER_02]: that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that could be specific to
each facility, but I think having that
[SPEAKER_02]: range is, is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, like being a politician,
if you're trying to make everyone happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making no one happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that's basically what
we're doing with these strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have half a dozen, half a dozen,
uh, different strains in the same room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a grower is, is probably trying
to find a temperature and humidity range
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of those strains can grow under,
but none of them are going to be optimized
[SPEAKER_00]: for any of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and, and that is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, there have been a few growers
that we've worked with that are strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to their grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they have two strains that have similar
physiologies and environmental responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've learned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they grow those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, because there is so much
genetic diversity, it is so hard to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what, what the ideal conditions are
for any of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's just not even growers who
are doing their own internal R and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any, and maybe you do,
and I'm sure there are some out there who
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking strains specifically,
you know, at light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're looking at temperature
and humidity levels as well in CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but probably they're focused on light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, when, when we work
with growers in vertical farms and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing say lettuce and arugula and basil,
one of the recommendations that I'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: them is I'll say, look, arugula is a cool
weather plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce is a mild weather plant and basil
is a hot weather plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why tomatoes and basil,
um, are good companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's several reasons,
but one of which is that they both like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sun and a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the tomato plant helps shade the
basil plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also produce chemicals that protect
each other, um, in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you might be interested to know that
Ted, if you didn't know that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but so, so here, let's just say we
have these three species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have arugula, lettuce, and basil,
and they like different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll tell growers is, look,
let's take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have the outlet from the air
conditioner start where the arugula is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it likes cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to move across the
lettuce plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after it's picked up all that
heat and humidity from the plants and from
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, it's then going to hit the
basil plant and that basil plant is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be basking in the warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you can literally, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can design this HVAC system to
literally have these plants like go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the flow, um, or grow with the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what, but with cannabis, it's so hard
because I don't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't know the difference
between, I don't know what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue likes and what I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super glue likes, and maybe they're both
because they're, they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you know, or what an indica
versus a sativa, uh, like, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've had growers say, well,
this indica, this is an indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it grows like a sativa or I have this
sativa that grows like an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like, Oh, what does
that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just talking about the
physiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they talking about how they water and
the nutrients they give it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they talking about the lights that it
like, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, there's, when you say one is
like the other, what, what is the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet it's different for every single
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so, you know, ideally,
ideally, again, we find these specific
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic, uh, strains that everybody agrees
on and we can start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if growers are doing their own internal
R and D, they're looking at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables and not just focused on one,
uh, to figure out, you know, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of their, um, cultivars and strains
like are like each other in all the ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a scientist and engineer, I can
understand your, uh, desire for
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency across genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but the challenge there, the
counterpoint to that is, uh, one
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial growers need to grow the high
cultivars, the hype strains that people
[SPEAKER_02]: want in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to sell your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing I would add to that is,
um, we don't really know exactly what the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal capabilities of this plant are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so exploring the genetic diversity is
really important at this stage of the
[SPEAKER_02]: game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that will continue,
uh, as we learn more about the entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect and what, how the terpenes and
flavonoids and all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: phytochemical responses create a certain,
uh, you know, effect for various human
[SPEAKER_02]: beings that are dealing with different
ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as nice as it would be to have everyone
grow, uh, Big Macs, I just don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: we're at that point in history right now,
like we are with other commercial crops
[SPEAKER_02]: due to some of these medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I get what you're saying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, just a couple of
thoughts about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, you know, for, for greenhouse
growers, uh, who do have control over
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment, maybe not as precise
and consistent as an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, greenhouses are,
are more susceptible to their external
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a cloudy day or a really hot,
sunny day or freezing cold day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you, you have, you have to
be able to live within a larger range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, um, or be able to cultivate
your plant and make those adjustments,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, necessary to, to keep your plant
healthy and productive, even when you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and I have been really impressed
with some of our clients and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that we've talked to who are,
who are looking for genetic genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: fit their environment, as opposed to
trying to force an environment on a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, you know, in Texas or
Florida, um, or, you know, somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's really humid, um,
finding genetics, finding strains that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, are less susceptible to mold pressures
in a high, high humidity environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is going to make your life so much
better and probably the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: installation and production a lot lower
because you're not trying to install air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioners or dehumidifiers or these,
you know, super power hungry pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to dry your greenhouse out,
to grow a strain that likes it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so, uh, you know,
but that's what breeding is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, we've been breeding so
many crops for 10,000 years, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're just scraping the surface here
with cannabis and, you know, maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 years we'll have like the very
perfect strains, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that, uh, we all, uh, can enjoy for
all sorts of, of, um, of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, you know, just in terms of
the medicinal qualities, uh, of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis flower of the,
of the plant, uh, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's similar to what we're learning about
other horticultural crops that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm again, I'm not a lighting
person necessarily, but of course there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of research around light,
but you know, the, we know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that par photosynthetically active
radiation is necessary for photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And photosynthesis is growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is fixing carbon dioxide to
produce carbohydrates, but that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily translate into the quality
characteristics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have been learning,
um, for all sorts of plants is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all those sort of in between wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the edge wavelengths that,
uh, are responsible for color that are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the, you know,
anthocyanin that's produced by a red oak
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what I love about that particular,
um, compound that plants produce is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only produced when that lettuce plant
is exposed to UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you never expose that plant to UV,
it would be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second, well, maybe minutes that
it's exposed to UV light, it produces the
[SPEAKER_00]: red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what scientists think is that the
anthocyanin is actually the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's protecting itself from UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we think it's a really pretty plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, learning about this
with, with cannabis as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the, the CBD profiles,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can produce from all these other
wavelengths of light that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily shown on the McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think the same is going to be
discovered with temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and VPD control with CO2 control that
maybe by dropping the carbon dioxide level
[SPEAKER_00]: to 400 parts per million, um, you know,
a joint veg, uh, maybe produces,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, a certain different quality
of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something that we know,
if you track global CO2 levels is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 naturally increases from spring
through fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason is because in the spring,
in the summer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are growing really quickly and
they're consuming the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they're dying, they're
actually, their respiration rates start to
[SPEAKER_00]: take over their photosynthesis rates,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to grow anymore in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dying now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that death is, is actually
releasing CO2 and there's less plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to absorb that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, I don't know, maybe a cannabis
plant wants lower CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it's young or in a middle
stage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: High levels early because you have these
high levels holding over from the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe lower CO2 levels in the
middle of its life and then boost it again
[SPEAKER_00]: in late flower when we already know that
CO2 levels are high in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just literally made that up right now on
the fly while talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but that, that's the type of,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the type of science,
um, that is so interesting, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing any plant, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and the fact that we get to
control those variables by growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and growing indoors,
um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's why I'm doing what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two main takeaways I have from what
we've talked about so far is one,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't look at any one of these
variables, uh, in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all relate to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we're talking about lighting
or we're talking about VPD, or we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about CO2, we really need to be
talking about all of these things in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then my other thought relating to
all this is when we look at research
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been done, we have to realize that
that research was done on a particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, strains, particular genetics and
that that may not appropriately apply
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly to our environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't say, you know, this is optimal
CO2 in this facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is optimal VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is optimal, um, you know,
PAR levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we need to take that data and
assimilate it and then try and extrapolate
[SPEAKER_02]: how this might apply to our personal
situation, I guess, or room for our plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and those genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if I were a grower,
I would probably pick my, my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you know, and what, what's a
favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super robust and, and, you know,
never gets powdery mildew or maybe it has
[SPEAKER_00]: low yields, but, uh, really high THC
quality or maybe just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people just love it, uh, for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, starting with those few
strains and, and if you have an R and D
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you know, try to find what,
at least CO2 temperature, VPD and light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are, you know, those combinations
work best.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and then, you know, and then grow
those plants, maybe even with all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: sister strains that you have there,
but now you've optimized the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for your quote unquote favorite,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the others, um, are, are, they're
going to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be fine, but they're just
not going to be optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ideally you're growing, you know,
one or two very similar strains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same space, which is an argument for
having smaller rooms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of having rooms that are maybe a thousand
or 2000 square feet, as opposed to a room
[SPEAKER_00]: that's six or 10,000 square feet,
where, you know, if you have 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of a flower room, you are absolutely
going to have a lot of strains that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to make it even more
challenging to find the sweet spot where
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those strains are able to,
to grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, you know, I, I want to make
sure that people realize too, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's, we're talking a lot
about the upper environment around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the leafy part of the plant,
but what happens at the root level is also
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by what happens, um, above,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, everything from, you know,
your, your nutrient levels and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how frequently and how much water,
um, to even how much evaporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you get from your substrate,
uh, that you're growing on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we have seen grower, you know,
growers are growing in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 or larger gallon, you know,
pots, fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's a large surface area of
exposed substrate and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, here they're watering once or twice
a day and you can very quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see like if, if they're actually
tracking temperature and humidity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, you can see a spike of water when
they irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can watch the humidity
decline over time until they, until they
[SPEAKER_00]: water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that water is not coming at that,
that humidity is not necessarily coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from evaporation from the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we've seen some growers who,
who sort of create like a cover around the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, but then you have to be careful
with that because then you might not get
[SPEAKER_00]: good oxygenation and breathing,
um, around the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, and then if we ask the
HVAC system to be really dynamic and
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidify more during a watering event
and then dehumidify less, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, later HVAC equipment,
it can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and it's not super responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it tries to respond,
but you know, you're, let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in like a 2000 square foot room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you have your sensors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many sensors do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you averaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you controlling based off of a peak
temperature or humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the bigger the room you have,
you know, you can expect to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but also your HVAC system can only
control to the inputs that it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, it's not going to
react really, really quickly, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why you see those, those spikes
when lights first turn on or when lights
[SPEAKER_00]: first turn off, because your, your AC unit
needs a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it probably needs about five
minutes, um, to actually respond to that
[SPEAKER_00]: change, which is why it's great when,
when growers dim their lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a sunrise, sunset type of schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or if they have a sophisticated
control system, they can, they can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually program, um, their, their,
uh, control algorithm to start ramping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ramping down, uh, depending on when the
lights are going to turn on or off to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of anticipate a big change in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, when it comes to
monitoring and controls, um, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really important to think about,
um, not only the capacity of your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and can it pull out all of that
humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it, can it control temperature and
remove all that heat from the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also how quickly can it respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to go into a defrost cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even tell you how many clients now
that we've had where we've helped them
[SPEAKER_00]: troubleshoot that all of a sudden their
system stops dehumidifying and it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that equipment went into like just a
standard defrost cycle for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they literally lose control for five
minutes of, of their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so then we're like, can we disable
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we change the frequency?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and just understanding what your
equipment can do and why it's doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does, um, you know, is, is important,
you know, if nothing else for just your
[SPEAKER_00]: sanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one of the reasons that I
like, uh, using the, the Blue Mat system,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, when they, where they make sense,
uh, just, just for the idea that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting, uh, water, uh, to the plants at a
lower rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's more consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't see as many as humidity
spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not for every, they're not for
every, uh, growing situation for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but at which I'm happy to talk about
with anyone who's, who's interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of irrigation system,
uh, cause we do work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, that is one perk to them that I
just want to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one other thing that you talked about
in terms of how, you know, the challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: around all this genetic diversity and
everything and optimizing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see the same thing with soils and
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to touch on that because
people think that there's like a best soil
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there really isn't, you know,
as someone who formulates soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, like I'm trying to come up with
one that's going to, it's almost like a
[SPEAKER_02]: shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to work in most situations?
[SPEAKER_02]: For most plants, uh, to create,
you know, their adequate, um, needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't see any issues with
deficiencies and everything will be at
[SPEAKER_02]: sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, one of the things that I
like to do with the growers that we work
[SPEAKER_02]: with is, um, you know, looking at all
these variables that we talk about is also
[SPEAKER_02]: from a nutrient perspective, then do
testing so that we can customize the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that we're sending them for
their media and, and, and their cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're running in their environment
as we see these tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So collecting that data, we can start
dialing these things in on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the nutrient side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it would be the same,
I assume on the HVAC side and the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental control side, um,
in terms of that data collection and
[SPEAKER_02]: slowly optimizing these targets,
uh, based off of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, free for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when thinking about soils,
I mean, how do you decide what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right water capacity or irrigation
frequency or irrigation methodology?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are you also looking at what's
happening in the environment around the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how, I mean, how, how do you see those
interactions playing out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll start by saying I'm still
learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're interviewing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I, I think, I think we're
still learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I try to do is stay, I think by
narrowing the range of variability in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of the media and water so that we
can keep it within a narrower range
[SPEAKER_02]: creates, uh, better outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by using, you know, blue mats,
for example, we're able to reduce the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuations in, in the water,
in the water, uh, in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, we, we tend to see
better, better overall growth and yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, you know, we have targets that
we aim for in our media, but as like one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing you mentioned is every media is
going to be a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the amount of like peat or if
you're using actual soil or cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever your, whatever your media is,
it's going to have slightly different
[SPEAKER_02]: water holding capacities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so all of those things need to be
factored in when we look at how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what a optimal, uh, soil
moisture level is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a complicated question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're still learning and I have a
pretty good idea for my soils or soils
[SPEAKER_02]: that have similar base, uh, materials,
but beyond that, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I think we're still learning and,
and I think that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, when it comes to,
to water, uh, you know, I was talking when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about VPD and when it's,
you know, the VPD, he's really high and
[SPEAKER_00]: the air is really dry that your plant is,
you know, there's more pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure on your plant to,
to transpire and to suck water through it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right from, from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you, if the water is not there,
um, you are more likely going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant start to wilt because it's not a
well watered plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so then you need to water more
frequently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, by the way, you may also need to
adjust your nutrient levels, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plant is going to be sucking
water so quickly that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might need to add more calcium,
uh, because you need to make sure some
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium gets to the plant so that you
don't have that calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or you may need to add more nutrients
because the plant is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing so quickly that it needs more
nutrients, um, to, to pull through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on the other hand, if you're,
if, if your VPD is really low and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is really high, um, then you
probably don't need to water as frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plants aren't going to be
transpiring as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, uh, you know, your,
your water frequency and your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels could actually be lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's kind of another way to think
about this is that by lowering the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit, by actually having a
slightly more humid environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can conserve water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what a cool way to conserve water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few topics that I'm going to
have to have you back on, uh, in the near
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to go part two because we
haven't talked about water use efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: and how you know, one aspect of
agriculture is that it uses a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking with Kelly Vance over
at beneficial and he was saying like
[SPEAKER_02]: something like seven gallons of water is
required to grow an almond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of these different
crops require a lot of water and we're,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're wasting water when we have drought
and, and, you know, it's such a water is
[SPEAKER_02]: such a huge issue right now, um,
for us as a society.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about resource use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we haven't talked about the benefits
of using different sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to talk to you personally about
living soils and vertical grow and airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: and biomass and the amount of soil and how
all those things relate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I want to talk to you about air
filtration with viruses and bacteria being
[SPEAKER_02]: such a hot topic these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all topics we haven't even
gotten to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one topic that I absolutely have
to get in this podcast though,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I get asked this question all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you might have some,
some good feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to know about curing and
optimal environments for curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there isn't a lot of research out
there on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you add to, uh, this topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sorry, I didn't prep you or warn you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's, it's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, what could you share about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and by curing, I'm assuming you also
mean drying because usually the two kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of go in hand in hand though they are
somewhat different processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding that, uh, one,
you know, one interesting anecdote about
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the market has changed from
wanting, you know, 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: these long cured, uh, you know,
cannabis flower to now it's about having
[SPEAKER_02]: freshly dried cannabis flower in terms of
preserving terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, all of these things are
going to slowly, uh, dissipate over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, you know, we're going to
lose, um, certain, certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we best dry cannabis from an
environmental perspective, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: in your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, in our experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for, um, the disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, we, so, so drying and
curing are slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we see them happening in the
same room, um, you know, in sequential
[SPEAKER_00]: days, sometimes there's a specific dry
room and a specific cure or product
[SPEAKER_00]: storage room, um, which we see that being
called that now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, with drying, our goal is to
suck out at least 50% of the moisture or I
[SPEAKER_00]: really, I should say 40% of the moisture
as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I say 40% specifically,
cause I made a comment very early in this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that at, at a 60% moisture
content, you have the highest water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of, of molds and spores and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can drop the water content,
um, you know, by 40%, then we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, really avoid the growth of those
diseases and avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of our growers are saying,
you know, help us to remove, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 to 50% of the total moisture content
we're going to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say that, you know,
the, the final moisture content that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to try to achieve is 12%,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between 10 and 13 or 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, uh, they want to get it down to,
you know, 40 or 50% in the first 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now doing that, uh, is pretty intensive
and, and kind of the challenges is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to remove 50% on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're trying to remove the
remaining say 30% over the course of the
[SPEAKER_00]: next eight or 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and just do sort of a slow
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day one is to prevent contamination and
the rest of the time is to preserve those
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and trichomes and the quality
characteristics that you just spent the
[SPEAKER_00]: last, you know, 16 weeks developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and we don't want to dry it so
quickly in the last, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight days of the drying cycle or whatever
that, that final period is, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to, um, we don't want to
vaporize the oil, uh, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: is in those trichomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to preserve that as part of the
drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and if we over dehumidify,
if we try to re if we try to remove,
[SPEAKER_00]: continue removing the same rate of
moisture that we did on day one,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then we're going to lose a lot of
those oils and, and terpenes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, you know, day one, 50% moisture
removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, if you can do it in 24 hours,
then you know, 48 and 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we're really pushing it if we go
beyond 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say pushing it in terms of,
you know, risk of contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the, you know, fine again,
you know, I had mentioned that HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment doesn't, doesn't respond really
quickly and doesn't really like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability if it can help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times we have a different
HVAC system that's operating on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we do the rest of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so, you know, because,
cause we want to do as much
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification as possible on day one
and then just a little the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is almost impossible to find an
HVAC unit that can go from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: zero to a hundred, um, in the blink of an
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's, that's kind of the drying
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will say that airflow is really
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love it when growers are using
hanging racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fairly easy for us to move air
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's vertically or horizontally
Baker's racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, what a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's worse than vertical farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I mean, you have such a
narrow gap of trying to move air through
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those, those flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just, I want those to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then when it comes to curing,
uh, you know, something that we've started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, cause there's this whole burping
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and what we're trying to do is,
you know, you've, you've, you've,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've trimmed the, the, the buds and now
you have them in these bins or these
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets or containers, you know,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they're, they're off gassing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're curing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that off gassing, we want,
we burp, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We burp that container to replenish it
then with oxygen, uh, with air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there must be an oxidization process
that we're actually trying to facilitate
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in, in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we replace the, the,
what's off gassed with, with air in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, and then we close the lid again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, 24 hours later,
we do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens if we never ventilate
this room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we never bring fresh air into this
room, is it possible that this room could
[SPEAKER_00]: become so filled with that off gassed,
you know, compounds, VOCs that when we
[SPEAKER_00]: burp the container, when we open these
containers, we're just refilling that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that head space with the VOCs that we,
you know, let out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so what we've been doing and working
with growers and sort of getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: permission and getting good feedback on is
providing a little bit of fresh air in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cure rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing a little bit of ventilation,
um, so that we are continuously removing
[SPEAKER_00]: those VOCs and exchanging it with fresh
air from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always filter this air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anyone thinking that we're
just bringing outside air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're, we're using high
efficiency filters to bring that air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely need, you know,
odor mitigation, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 95% of the time, because we are,
um, releasing those VOCs out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the outside, to the exterior of the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what our growers are telling us is
that they're getting good quality by
[SPEAKER_00]: curing with this bit of fresh air and just
keeping that air fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, the curing process,
you know, it seems to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I mentioned that, you know,
it has morphed some of our projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names have morphed into product
storage as opposed to, um, to a cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of that has to do with
the regulations and codes in your specific
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction and where you're located,
which is why we're seeing such a
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately you're, you're keeping it
in that same place until you package it
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those, those buds can stay in that
room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere from a couple of weeks to several
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and it's really important to
maintain a good temperature in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really when it comes to humidity,
humidity and moisture control,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, you know, by the time you
finish that drying process, if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: moved it into a dedicated cure room,
you don't want your flowers to either
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb or release moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about vapor pressure
deficit, this is where the science would
[SPEAKER_00]: really help is to know what is the right
VPD to basically hold that flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: stasis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't want it to get any more wet
or any more dry than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unless that is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we, you know, depending on the
client, depending on the project and the
[SPEAKER_00]: location, um, we might have, you know,
air conditioning as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification and humidification to,
to always be able to very precisely
[SPEAKER_00]: control the cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that we don't, we don't dry or,
or wet the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one question I have to all this is,
you know, you gave some targets like
[SPEAKER_02]: removing 40% of the moisture in the plants
within the first 24 hours and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, tailoring down from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, that's great for a
commercial facility or someone with an
[SPEAKER_02]: water activity meter, but what sort of
like, you know, I want to, I want to also
[SPEAKER_02]: speak to like that home grower or people
that don't have the ability to dial in
[SPEAKER_02]: their environmentals quite so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are there any pointers or targets
that you would recommend, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you alluded to the idea that,
you know, Baker's racks are not as good
[SPEAKER_02]: as, you know, bucking and dry hanging the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what other sort of things can we do
that you've considered to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: more optimal or best practice in relation
to dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think air movement, is super
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is why I don't like Baker's
racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard to move air through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like in, you know, in a,
in the cultivation facility, if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity, one way that you,
one way you can mitigate that high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is by blowing air across your
plants to help break up that boundary
[SPEAKER_00]: layer, help, you know, the water move away
from the plant that it's, that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: transpired and, and evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, rather than it just sort of hovering
around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the drying room is even if
you can't control to a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity is if you're
moving air and not fast, but just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you feel the air moving,
um, through that room and across those
[SPEAKER_00]: branches and flowers, then, um,
you're probably going to be in good shape
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want that air to be filtered if
possible and recirculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't want to bring anything in
because, um, again, we don't want to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: those spores around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if, if you can, if you can
target a temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want the temperature to be less than 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the temperature needs
to be less than 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some growers who are really trying
to chill their plants, but if you can hit
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 or 70 degrees, which most sort of
residential or light commercial equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: can do, um, then, uh, you know,
the, the relative humidity to target again
[SPEAKER_00]: is less than 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, somewhere between 50 and 60%
would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, you know, at that 60%,
you know, I talked about moisture content
[SPEAKER_00]: and water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the same is true for, for relative
humidity is that that is the moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, relatively speaking,
pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the moisture content of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so keeping the relative humidity below
60% is going to be, you know, helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, the best way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in some of our commercial
facilities, we, we do do it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, do do, we do do hit old
school, um, with, you know, just some mini
[SPEAKER_00]: splits and dehumidifiers and working
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still seems to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for a lot of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so air movement, temperature between
65 and 70 degrees and a relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if, if you can control
those variables, it'll be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be helpful for people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, we've been talking for a while
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know you're busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I would love to follow up with you
with some of these other questions on,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk about resource use
efficiency in general, dig in more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that water thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know, uh, at least here in
California, energy is on a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: minds because of the new 2022 code,
um, that was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know growers are worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, uh, anyway,
I think there's a lot we, we can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll look forward to the next
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I hope you have a wonderful rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I look forward to following up
with you really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chad.
