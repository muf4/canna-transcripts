[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week needs very little
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever studied lighting,
you've probably read some of his research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce Bugbee is a professor at Utah State
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is president of Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is internationally known for his work
with NASA to design food systems for
[SPEAKER_02]: people living on Mars and has been a
frequent speaker at conferences on indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: food production on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2011, he received the Governor's Medal
for Science from Utah Governor Gary
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has recorded several videos on
photobiological principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for Bugbee agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps his pinnacle achievement is
summarizing everything he knows in a TED
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk entitled, Turning Water into Food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be here, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start off talking a little bit for
listeners who may not be as familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: you and your work and research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professor at Utah State University
and specifically a professor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: College of Agriculture and more
specifically, my classes are plant
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology and plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things I teach and the
research I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: About close to 40 years ago now,
I got funded very early in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got funded by NASA for plants in space
and living on the moon, living on Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got my students and I into doing
photobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way before there was any LEDs,
but we still had different types of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to study the effects of
spectral quality on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's now become a big part of the
research in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for listeners who may not be familiar
with the term, correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photobiology refers to the effect of light
on organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like humans, plants, all living things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a broad term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo is light and biology is all of
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be effects of light on
microorganisms, effects of light on
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: My part of that is heavily focused on
light on higher plants and even more
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowly, effect of light on food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not studying ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a forest, my colleagues study those
sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my work is very heavily focused on
economic plants, which of course cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is an example of an economic plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when it comes to lighting,
everyone talks and looks to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seems like in the industry for research
and expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have quite that reputation of being
sort of that leading expert when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was really excited to get you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard you speak multiple times,
as well as online.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some great YouTube videos that
I'll put links to in the podcast page that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've put out with Apogee.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have a role over at Apogee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to touch on that too and
mention the company a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in 1995, I started to make light
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in my garage and I was
modifying voltmeters and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: photodiodes in them to measure
photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I subsequently started a company
and the company now has 30 some employees
[SPEAKER_00]: and quite a nice building here in Logan,
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still intimately involved with the
research and development in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my day job is at the university
and my weekend job is my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the company makes instruments to
measure light, not surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a spin off of my research
and different wavelengths of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroradiometers, quantum sensors for
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's given me an additional ability
to do research to help growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to spend the majority of the
podcast talking about, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: LED lighting and some of the research and
knowledge you have around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk briefly about the equipment
that Apogee sells and what some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tools are for measuring light in a growing
facility and how best to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ted, I might start this by just
saying, you can go for probably $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and buy a lux meter or a foot
candle meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are real cheap and they do give
you relative levels of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they weight the colors all wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weight green and not blue and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people buy those and measure lights
for plants and they can have very
[SPEAKER_00]: significant errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even beyond that, most of us,
most people think they can tell how bright
[SPEAKER_00]: the light is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at it and they say, that's
pretty bright and a little brighter over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the human eye, when the light is high,
the iris contracts to just a pinhole and
[SPEAKER_00]: it regulates the amount of light getting
to the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are inside and you look at a
very well-lit room and you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this brighter or about the same as
outside or less?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most say, no, no, no, no, it's a
little less in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take a meter and a well-lit
office might be 10 units of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the units we use are micromoles of
photons per meter squared of area per
[SPEAKER_00]: second, just like it was little invisible
marbles falling on a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be 10 in a well-lit office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside at noon on a sunny day,
it's 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000 divided by 10, that's 200 times more
light outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants respond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow almost 200 times as fast outside
as they would in a well-lit office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just stunning to people when
they've never measured light and they hold
[SPEAKER_00]: a meter and they walk around and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they just can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of times in my career,
I've seen that the light bulb go on for
[SPEAKER_00]: people and they go, my goodness,
I didn't know what I was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're measuring light everywhere
and the plants do see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of, that's probably the
single most common problem is people under
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciating the amount of light that
plants need and they don't provide enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they blame it on the fertilizer
or something else when it's just plain not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of thing is how Apogee
started was I recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started making low cost meters for
people and help people measure light and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically light for plants,
which we call photosynthetic radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, that people just get buying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've, the company got bigger and the
products got better and in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to get back to your original
question, you asked me something about how
[SPEAKER_00]: would you measure this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the simplest sense, there's a
single sensor that makes an electric
[SPEAKER_00]: signal goes to a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That integrates all the colors of light in
one sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we call it a quantum sensor because
a quantum is a mole of photons and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively low cost sensor, but it doesn't
tell you if you have red light or green
[SPEAKER_00]: light or blue light, it just tells you the
total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that you need a spectral
radiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the price jumps up to about $2,000
and depending on the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral radiometer, but that tells you
the individual wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for research, we're always using
spectral radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but for just spot checking things,
we're just using the quantum sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick summary of a lot of
different things, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of light meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to try and recap this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and please correct me if I get
anything wrong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about a light meter,
we want one that's going to be measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: par that 400 to 700 nanometer range,
because that's the range that is
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to know the intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the word intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the best
definition, the amount of photons that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be hitting the meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and that tells us the PPFD or
that longer term that you threw out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've always used PPFD just cause
it's easier for me, but being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: measure that as an important tool,
because when we talk about a grow light,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, we want to know how far away
from that light should we position our
[SPEAKER_02]: plant based on the, the stage of growth of
the plant, you know, how hard we're
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing the plant, you know, and every,
every light's going to be slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I think that's an important tool
in a facility to be able to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy, if I'm a foot away, I'm at 1200
PPFD versus two feet away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That light quality, that light intensity
falls off quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the one foot away, two feet away,
three feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's almost like sticking your
finger in, in orange juice and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and licking it and saying, Oh,
I think the pH is pH four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not measuring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an experienced person can make a
reasonable guess, but boy, given how
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive the plants are to the total
amount of light and how fast it changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can measure it and go a foot away and
it's a different number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just cannot see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot see that with our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where light meters come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gosh, in my experience, they're,
they're very underutilized in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, we have, we take what the sun
gives us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure it, but we can't change it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside, we can change it and to
optimize it, you got to measure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about light,
just as an overview, we're really talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about a few different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the intensity of the
light, which would be the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: photons hitting a leaf or a given point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the quality of the
light in terms of the range and spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: of that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're talking about the DLI,
which would be the amount of light that
[SPEAKER_02]: plants going to receive over the given
photo period when the light is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of talk a little bit about
those three things or if there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's a major component that I'm
missing here in the summary, feel free to
[SPEAKER_02]: add onto that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can, we can certainly break it
down into quantity and quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and both of them are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantity is underappreciated and quality,
people over worry about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be all thinking more about the
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantity of the lights that get and
less about the ratios of colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the quantity is a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the meters measure light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calibrated to give you a number
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all good, but what the plants
respond to is the daily light integral,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means the total amount of light over
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meters don't automatically give you
that you have to connect it to a little
[SPEAKER_00]: microprocessor that adds up the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best analogy is like a rain gauge
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know how much total it rained
in that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the total for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hook your sensors up to a little
microprocessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds them up and, and records the total
for the day either gives it to you on a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen or records it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the daily light integral is a step
above just measuring the instantaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: light per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, if you have electric lights,
it's possible to say, this is what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lights were on for 16 hours and
multiplied to get the baby light integral,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as the light is exactly constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in a greenhouse anywhere that has
variable light, you need to record it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, the PPFD that you mentioned is
stands for, I think you know this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the amount of light per unit
area, per unit time and amount of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try not to call it light because
usually the word light refers to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios of colors that people see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, in my papers, you'll see,
we rarely use the term light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always say photon flux because that's
more precisely what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though that sounds very technical,
after a while you get to use, you used to
[SPEAKER_00]: saying photon flux and then you're,
then you can impress people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People at parties because you didn't say
light, you said photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so that's quantity of just the pure
total that the plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality is the ratios of the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, to measure that you need a
spectral radiometer, little prism and it
[SPEAKER_00]: divides up the colors of light and
measures them all separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sophisticated instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee Instruments sells a couple
different models and Apogee is always
[SPEAKER_00]: working on better quality, cheaper
spectral radiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, now there's a fairly wide array
of spectral radiometers on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, if you get a lower cost one,
the optics aren't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolution isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I'm telling cyan from blue or
some, you know, some color, some
[SPEAKER_00]: discrimination of color that a human could
easily see that the instrument might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to do that in the lower cost
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we get ratios of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as everybody knows, we can manipulate
plant shape with ratios of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if this is a time to,
I could make a review of all of that here,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that seems appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it relates to a comment
that you made on one of your YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: videos and you touched on here too saying
that light quantity is more important than
[SPEAKER_02]: quality in relation to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, we do get caught up in
looking at spectrum when we look at bulbs,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we look at LED lights, but your
research is showing that that's not as
[SPEAKER_02]: important or you're not seeing as much
variability in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantity is more important than quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I think it comes from what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes are exquisitely good at seeing
tiny differences in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you go to a paint store and
there's, what is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to the six different shades of colors
of paint because we can tell all those
[SPEAKER_00]: colors apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell those colors apart better than
a plant can cause just because our eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: are so exquisitely tuned to see shades of
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our eyes, as I mentioned a minute ago,
our eyes can't really tell intensity very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you say, well, intuitively,
no wonder we're so worried about color and
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't worry about intensity because we
worry about what we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the plants, it's really the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity is what determines
photosynthesis and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the color for the most part determines
plant shape, meaning a tall skinny plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a short fat plant, those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we went through the colors,
there's really divide them into five
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, if we start with ultraviolet,
those are the photons below 400
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can barely see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're just not visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course humans think, oh,
ultraviolet is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put on sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we really ought to be thinking
is, some ultraviolet is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some ultraviolet is good for people
because it makes vitamin D and some
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet is good for plants because it
makes them tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can trigger chemistry that is
associated with flavors in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultraviolet, and now we have
ultraviolet, we have UV LEDs that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called UVA 360.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the peaks are 365 and 385
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell they're on, but just barely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we manipulate those to change
flavors in food and quality in plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the laboratory, it's been harder to
do that than we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, oh, this will be pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just shine these in and all kinds of
things will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not been as easy to do that as we
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next color up is blue and blue has
powerful effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight is full of blue light and it
makes plants tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They synthesize pigments that protect the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants make their own sunscreen and
protects them against UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But blue has always helped keep plants
short and that's almost always a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found blue photons can have a
bigger effect on some of these flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds than ultraviolet photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's contrary to the popular belief that
ultraviolet are really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But blue photons help keep plants short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons are in the middle and people
say, oh, the green photons, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why plants look green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just a tiny fraction that
bounces off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons are primarily valuable for
the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some green photons in the
lights, you can see the plants better and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can distinguish tiny insects and tiny
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases just when they're just barely
starting from the green light from the
[SPEAKER_00]: LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a huge advocate of LED fixtures
should have more green photons in them so
[SPEAKER_00]: that people can see the plants better and
better diagnose the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can keep going just a minute,
red photons are really well absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they're very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of photons you get per watt or
per joule of electricity is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most efficient LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're expensive to produce for a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LEDs, the red LEDs can cost five times
as much as a white LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't always put a lot of red LEDs
in a fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, they're
photosynthetically efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're electrically efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as more and more people are
coming to know all the time, there's far
[SPEAKER_00]: red photons, which are 700 to 750
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those we can barely see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a burner on an electric
stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can barely tell it's on,
that's far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard to read a book by that amount
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those have big effects on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly they increase stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really want tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in lettuce, they increase leaf
expansion, which is really a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly in lettuce, far red
photons really help the plants expand
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just went through five colors of
light from UV all the way up to far red in
[SPEAKER_00]: a fast overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to go back and ask some
specific questions regarding these various
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrums in relation to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you've talked before about dark
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people will use green lights
typically when they want to go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis broom during a dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done any research to really see?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they used to say plants don't see
green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's been disproven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you touch on that a little bit?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even call green light safe lights,
because you can turn them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants won't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that's completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants seek that green light almost as
well as blue and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, if you have to go in at night,
just use as dim a light as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the green light, the plants do see it
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some of our studies, they can see
it just as well as the other colors of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, which is sort of unfortunate,
because wouldn't it be nice to go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the green light and be able to see
the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants can't tell you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful about using green safe
lights at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's good advice, because I know I
bought a green light back when I very
[SPEAKER_02]: first started growing, thinking if I ever
had to go into the room or see the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I would use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like, again, you're saying
light intensity is more important than the
[SPEAKER_02]: light spectrum or light quality,
I guess, in that case.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have to use dim light,
make it as green light, make it as dim as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking about cannabis specifically,
then, you mentioned UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned far red.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did these spectrums affect terpene
production, cannabinoid production?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how important are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like you just stated, you don't
seem as focused on spectrum as I would
[SPEAKER_02]: have thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, these spectrums do have an
impact on the morphology of your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what recommendations might you make or
areas for research around spectral
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are certainly researching cannabinoid
synthesis full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also getting into terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got lots more data on
cannabinoid synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have not found nearly as big of
effects of ratios of colors as we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: we would.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that many other people,
this will go up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't say there was none,
no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just smaller than they thought
they would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one specific example that growers
often observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those red LEDs are electrically
efficient and good photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: many manufacturers put lots of red in
their fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real common now to have white LEDs
with a lot of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great combination of colors
because you get enough white so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a little bit of blue,
you put some blue in, and then you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that red, the fraction of red photons
starts to climb up above maybe 70%,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see white tips on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real striking because these big
flower buds and the top half an inch,
[SPEAKER_00]: the top centimeter doesn't have any
chlorophyll in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_00]: At best, it's light yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is a striking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people have reported this,
and we have done enough studies on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it only happens when the
fraction of red photons is very high,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe above about 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think is happening is the red
photons are like dessert, and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants soak them up and they love
them, but the plants don't make photo
[SPEAKER_00]: protective pigments when they have a lot
of red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are nice photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to protect ourselves against
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't synthesize photo protective
pigments, at least in the tips of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and then it causes photo
bleaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light degrades the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So empirically, we regularly see it with
high fractions of red, and we think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the lack of photo protective
pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants always have to synthesize things to
protect, filter the light and protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll, protect other things in the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a little sidebar story
about those white tips in cannabis flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: under high fractions of red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always thought that was associated
with too high of PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know cannabis can handle very high
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of leads me into one of my
questions, though, is transitioning plants
[SPEAKER_02]: from different levels of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that moving from HPS to LED
lights, for example, changing that
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum can have an impact on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just ratcheting up the intensity or
the photons on a given plant too rapidly
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to have detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any research on or any
information?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I thought plant bleaching was caused
by moving a plant that was under fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: low light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say 400 PPFD up to like 1,000,
1,200 overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would see that sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a common thought, that photo
bleaching is either too high a light or
[SPEAKER_00]: too fast to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have evidence for either one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown plants with very high light,
and all the flowers are nice and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lower level of light, but a higher
high fraction of red, the tips turn white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's far more related to the fraction
of red than it is to total intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a non-intuitive thing, because you
see bleaching, the light must be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really is is the red photon
fraction is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, relative to changing light levels,
that's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, sometimes lots of growers just
very carefully ramp the lights up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we have done studies with
photosynthesis, where we're measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate of the leaves,
they adapt to new light levels very
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly, like certainly within one day to
a change in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea to not change the
light too fast, but it doesn't have the to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, and our data indicates it doesn't have
to be as gradual as most people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone from a light level of 300
micromoles to the next day, 1200
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And provided there's proper water and
nutrients, the plants are just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They jump right up the photosynthetic rate
quadruples, the light quadruples and the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate quadruples right away
the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say rapid changes of light
don't matter at all, because I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but they just don't matter nearly as
much as people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna touch on that a little more,
because I remember from my botany classes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this was a little while ago,
so I'm a little shaky that plants would
[SPEAKER_02]: have shade leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the levels of chlorophyll were more
adapted to lower light conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would change over time based on
the amount of light that leaf was
[SPEAKER_02]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're saying though is that cannabis
can make these changes just pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a couple of days, it can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a shade leaf is a thinner leaf and a
sun leaf is thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a thin leaf doesn't just become thick
overnight, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chloroplasts inside the leaf
orient, if you can imagine, if you took
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand and held it flat in low light,
it'd be flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you give it highlight within
minutes, the chloroplasts turn on an edge
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't have so much light
shining on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the light penetrates deeper into
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an example of the change that
happens in minutes, and certainly within
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour, as a plant grows from low light
to high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, in high light, the next set of
leaves, which starts to come out a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days later, is a high light leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has a short-term adaption
that's rapid, and then a more profound
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term adaption to the high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen some really good growers
that inch that light up just 50 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, and I'm thinking they could go much
faster than that in terms of optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: production per unit area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you have the capability of
giving them high light, I would give them
[SPEAKER_00]: high light so that they can just ramp up
faster and start growing faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've always heard about 10% a day
was sort of the rule with LEDs in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: ramping them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we could maybe adjust that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question that had me thinking about
was, since we're changing the photo period
[SPEAKER_02]: so dramatically with cannabis indoors,
and that's not really something that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can change necessarily, how do we best
utilize light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be better to, say, ramp up the
light intensity, the PPFD prior to
[SPEAKER_02]: flipping to a 12-12 cycle while you're
still in veg, or is it better to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're using lower light levels in
veg traditionally in a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we make that jump, is it better to do
it before switching the photo period or
[SPEAKER_02]: after?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any research on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where instantaneous light,
micromoles per meter squared per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're always growing cannabis at
18-hour, roughly 18-hour photo periods to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it stays in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we switch to 12-hour photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you didn't change the intensity,
you're just cut the light by two-thirds,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from 18 to 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut it to two-thirds of what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that the plants perform based on
daily light integral, you can ramp it way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did the math, if you had roughly 600
micromoles for 18 hours, you'd go to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants would have the exact same
daily light integral, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the intensity, it's less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's common to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you could ramp the light up in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the plants will adapt just
fine, even if you don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping the DLI closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep the DLI the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so talking about light intensity
there, when you mentioned the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: micromoles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are you hearing is optimal for
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get asked this question a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear numbers around 1,000, up as high as
1,200.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize that some of your research has
shown that cannabis can handle much higher
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're talking about the cost of
wattage, and I realize that the value of
[SPEAKER_02]: the crop, what you're able to get for the
crop, what the cost of your electricity in
[SPEAKER_02]: your facility is, all of these things are
going to be factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have a general recommendation
for optimal levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we say optimal, we usually mean
an economic optimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the return on investment for a unit of
electric power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to be really comprehensive,
it's the return on investment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many fixed costs in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can afford to be suboptimal
electrically, but your overall return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment is better because the yield
goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for a standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would typically peak at maybe 500 or
600 micromoles, really fairly low level of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do grams per watt per meter
squared, because you have to calculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: area in there, now it's going to peak more
like 1,000 or 1,200 because the area is in
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, as I pointed out in previous
videos, is certainly a highlight crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, it responds just beautifully to some
real highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have pushed it in some studies
higher than that, pushed it to 1,600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yield keeps going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had 30% more light and the yield
goes up maybe 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a decreasing return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push it with higher and higher light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the capital costs go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy all those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of other input costs go up at higher
light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also depends on how optimal a grower is
able to keep the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients and water have to be just
right all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have much margin for error
in high light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive in a race car at 600 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you better have good tires and good
brakes and a good steering wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the other things have to be
co-optimized with that higher light
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's harder to get everything
optimal if the light input is real high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wanted to touch on that because
you've repeatedly said that in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: run higher light conditions, you have to
have optimal grow conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're referencing more water,
more nutrients, more CO2, I assume,
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to achieve this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clarify that a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you always want to be
enriching with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the effect is optimal at
1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little bit more to go to 1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just always want to be optimizing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lots of advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost is tiny to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, if you're watering with a
liquid fertilizer, you automatically get
[SPEAKER_00]: more nutrients when you go to higher light
because the plant will use more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you double the light, the water use
roughly doubles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your water always has the nutrient
solution in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you're watering with a nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put twice as much water on,
you automatically put twice as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a slow release fertilizer that's
coming in some of the ways, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you do have to increase the
fertilizer just because you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bigger plant with higher light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting it right all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All hours of the day, and especially
water, just making sure plants not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to run out of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I work with a facility that did a
trial, a lighting trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were able to increase their
yields quite dramatically by switching
[SPEAKER_02]: from double ended HPS over to a full
spectrum LED light.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they also were looking at using
HPS in veg and then flowering in LED and
[SPEAKER_02]: different combinations of such.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using LEDs for veg and then flowering
with HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got significantly different
yields on the final crop based on what
[SPEAKER_02]: that combination of lighting technology
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any information relating to
transitioning from lighting technologies
[SPEAKER_02]: one to another?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people say going from LED to
HPS is fine, but going from HPS to LED is
[SPEAKER_02]: a little trickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take the old days before LEDs
with cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the old days might have been like 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the old days weren't that long
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone always used metal halide lights
for veg and high pressure sodium for
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used the CMH lights,
which are popular again now because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot more options on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ask people, why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been done that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, what was happening was
metal halide lights have a lot of 30% blue
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, way high blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kept the plants short in veg,
which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But metal halide lights are not very
efficient electrically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you went to flowering where the
height was already mostly established,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you could use the high pressure
sodium, which are more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: electrically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can give them much higher light
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without knowing really the underlying
reasons, people were doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable, giving them a lot of blue
photons to keep them short, make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants short early, and then just using a
really efficient light later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our studies, if anything, high pressure
sodium is a near perfect spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 4% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got plenty of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good spectrum for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, of course, LEDs have passed up
high pressure sodium by quite a bit in
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've certainly been coming on
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really isn't because the spectra is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs with a high fraction of blue,
blue photons are not as photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient as red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to put more blue in your
fixture than you need, just enough to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants short, keep them making
photoprotective pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we're studying in
detail now on a range of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the minimum amount of blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's somewhere between about 3% and
maybe 10%, depending on plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of lights have 15%, 20%,
even 25% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not an optimal spectrum for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may keep the plants too short.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk about, since we're kind
of getting into this idea of commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: LED lights, but before we do, I had one
more spec real question for you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the 660 to 680 nanometers play a part
in the increase of anthocyanin production
[SPEAKER_02]: in plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is its level too high in current grow
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: The 600 to 680, those are all red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they do not uniquely enhance
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue photons enhance anthocyanins,
which are the red pigments in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that red pigment is one of the most
classic photoprotective pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do plants make red pigments?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to protect them against excess light
and too much, protect them against UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those photoprotective pigments absorb
photons and they don't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins, that's red because those red
photons are blocking some of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To more specifically answer this,
red light doesn't trigger them.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blue light does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why my purple varieties of tomatoes
grow so much slower than my other
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the price to pay for that nice
color.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, higher in antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposedly more nutritious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the trade off I was told.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about commercial LED
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you go about evaluating them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we've moved to full spectrum
lights with LEDs that we've moved away
[SPEAKER_02]: from that bluish purple color so we can
now see our plants again, which I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful for.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a grower, if I were to outfit a
facility what questions should I be asking
[SPEAKER_02]: a company that makes LED lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first one is real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's the cost per watt of fixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the last thing manufacturers want
you to know is what the fixture costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, for getting a 600 watt fixture
and a 300 watt, you can pay twice as much
[SPEAKER_00]: for the 600 watt fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a simple ratio, but knowing what
you get costs per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, it's the efficacy of the
fixture, which is measured in micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per joule, but it's really the output of
the fixture divided by the electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: input to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is explained in some of my papers and
some of my talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to think about this is the
micromoles per second out divided by watts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the electric input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixtures can vary quite a bit in that
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the manufacturer has paid to get more
efficient LEDs in there, the fixture is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth more money because the light output
is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, how many moles of photons
does this fixture put out and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: watts of electricity does it have coming
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's the cost of the fixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just very fundamental ratios in
considering a fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people still use high pressure
sodium because the fixtures are so cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just remarkably cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, after we're dollars and
photons out, one consideration that people
[SPEAKER_00]: need to think about is how much focusing
of the light do they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to make LEDs very focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a lens on the LED and they can be very
focused, almost like a laser of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good if you know exactly where you
want the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shine it on the aisle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely difficult to get uniform
light if your fixtures are that focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, high pressure sodium, we mount them
up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread the light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, well, some of it falls on the
aisles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wasted, but it's also real uniform
over the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something LEDs have been working on
is spreading the light out more,
[SPEAKER_00]: not making it less focused so the photons
get spread out over a bigger area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is more uniform light for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To summarize this, it's really cost of the
fixture, wattage output, efficiency or
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy of the fixture, and then beam
spread of the photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want focus photons or do you want
spread out photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about the application so that the
photons are uniform and they maximally
[SPEAKER_00]: fall on leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: To further complicate things, if I'm
understanding you correctly from what you
[SPEAKER_02]: were saying earlier, the spectrum also
influences the efficiency of the light if
[SPEAKER_02]: there were more blue LEDs in the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a less efficient light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I getting that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we don't put usually just blue
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue LEDs come from white LEDs,
but it's a blue LED with a phosphor
[SPEAKER_00]: coating that fluoresces and gives us white
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't usually see fixtures with just
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see white LEDs and reds, those two
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's becoming a very common LED fixture
and it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the ratios of the whites and the
reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ratio will affect efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more reds you put in, the more
efficient the light because the reds are
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient than the whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to probably be a dumb
question, but I'm going to ask it anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to photons and hitting a
canopy, I've heard claims that certain
[SPEAKER_02]: lights are more effective at infiltrating
a canopy as in penetrating deeper so you
[SPEAKER_02]: have less light fall off over a given
distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to see big variations between
different lighting manufacturers on
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's lots of claims at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two factors affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one people don't often think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light penetrates deeper than the
other colors because it's reflected off
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and it bounces around and gets
lower in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light is helpful for penetrating
canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger factor is the ratio of direct
photons to diffuse photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct photons would be like a sunny day
where the lights just shining straight
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffuse photons are like a cloudy day when
it's coming from all directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffuse light penetrates canopies much
better than direct light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from all directions,
let me use an analogy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have to be with a flower because
I can't really use BBs for this analogy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you were going to put a scoop of
flower on a plant and you just dumped it
[SPEAKER_00]: straight down, the flower would stick to
the top leaves and it wouldn't penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you took your scoop of flower and
shook it so it made a cloud of dust?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that came in all directions,
you would get more flower on the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That analogy is like diffuse light.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium then leads to quite
diffuse light because a lot of the photons
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the fixture sideways and
they're going into plants three rows over
[SPEAKER_00]: at a low angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those photons can penetrate the canopy
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then ones that shoot straight down from
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixtures that have a big beam spread,
spread the light out better, lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: better penetration of photons into
canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffuse light means light from multiple
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in sideways, it comes in straight
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bigger factor of penetrating the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color matters, but not as much as diffuse
photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm picturing these photons,
I guess, bouncing off of different
[SPEAKER_02]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you have a white wall, for example,
next to a row of plants or bouncing off of
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and possibly penetrating deeper
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I understand, the spectrum defines the
speed of the photon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not the speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wavelength of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all travel at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not as obvious as it might seem,
but it's the wavelength of the vibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vibration level, I guess I'm
picturing this agitation that allows for
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels of penetration into a
leaf or bouncing off of a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me use another analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a confusing thing, this frequency
of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had blue photons or hot photons,
high energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: High energy would be like a bunch of third
graders.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the wavelength gets longer,
you could consider it, by analogy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the photons are getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get out to red photons,
they're like a 70-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not moving as fast as the third
graders, bouncing around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of those get, that's an analogy
for energy of the photons, but the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't care what the energy level of the
photon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: One high-energy third-grader photon causes
the exact amount of photosynthesis as one
[SPEAKER_00]: low-energy, longer wavelength photon after
it's absorbed by photosynthetic pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's just a matter of absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue photons and red photons are very
highly absorbed right in the surface of a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bounce off, so they don't
penetrate the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons bounce off, and they rattle
around and they penetrate deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at what point, then, do we determine
that a leaf is a nutrient sink versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic benefit to a plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a certain PPFD, if we're using a
light meter, where we could hold it down
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, OK, we're getting down to 400 or
200 PPFD here underneath the canopy,
[SPEAKER_02]: these leaves need to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, people spend a lot of time
pruning canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we don't prune is those old
leaves automatically translocate their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and their carbon up to the
younger leaves of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't die and fall off and take all
these resources with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move it to the younger leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take those off, you're removing
nutrients and carbon compounds that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be used by the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we do prune when we have inadequate
air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For disease reasons, pruning really helps
move air and minimize disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many people prune thinking that those
old leaves are bad, or the plants get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we get very high yields without
pruning because those leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: translocating, remobilizing their
resources into the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut them off, they can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picturing like a fruit tree in the
fall where it sends its sugars back into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants itself for winter to make it
until the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that essentially what you're
referencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves that fall off of all trees,
not just fruit trees, have very many
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant took them back in before winter
and stored them in the trunk of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have so many questions, but I'm going
to narrow it down to just a couple more so
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't keep you on the phone too much
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're coming up on a little over
an hour already.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this will be fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So real quick, I'm seeing lenses on more
and more LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done any research with the use of
lenses to focus light in relation to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or indoor plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think of lenses as focus alike,
that can also spread it out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends if the lens is convex or
concave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a very general rule, I see more
fixtures where they're spreading the light
[SPEAKER_00]: out to get a more uniform amount of
photons in a canopy and also to help kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get those sideways photons penetrating
deeper in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a type of lens that does the
opposite of focusing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It unfocuses the photons and spreads them
out more sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how useful then is really changing
spectrum in light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some lights give you the ability to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other lights don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that don't, I hear the common
thing saying growers are more likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: screw things up than actually make any
benefit based on where our current
[SPEAKER_02]: research is on lighting spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuning the lights comes at the cost of the
total number of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes at the cost of fixture
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start adjusting them,
it always takes a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it's possible to change
the spectrum over time, and if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you can have benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gosh, for me, I would take a fixed
spectrum and I would take the total
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take an efficient fixture that
gave me a lot of light rather than one
[SPEAKER_00]: where I could change the colors that gave
me less light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a rule of thumb, I like fixed
spectra because you get more light per
[SPEAKER_00]: unit of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, research-wise is another matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change colors all the time in research,
but that's different than production.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my very last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What future research are you most excited
about right now in the world of lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we are continuing to investigate
ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of kinds of ultraviolet
all the way down to UVC using UVC
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially for short bursts of time,
for disease control, and also to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: plants short.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studies on the potentially beneficial
effects of UV, they're just understudied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a series of studies going on
with the minimum amount of blue light that
[SPEAKER_00]: plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing lots of work on light
pollution at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light can the plants,
can cannabis tolerate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is real sensitive to light
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the colors matter at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that's an active area
of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked about variable spectra
over the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more interested in variable
intensity over the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When can we put more photons on?
[SPEAKER_00]: When could be putting less photons on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another active area of research for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can imagine, you know,
maximizing or optimizing your light
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency would have huge ecological
impact on this industry in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of electricity that we're
potentially, you know, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting with the way we're growing right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gotten more efficient compared to
where it was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm excited to see what you guys come
up with on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a new crop, sensitive to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, it's so high value we can afford
to grow it indoors under electric lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take advantage of all the control
we have over delivering light to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I sure appreciate your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned quite a few things myself and I
know that others will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you've done a lot of good work
and research for the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant industry in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just really grateful for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might mention here at the end,
we are getting ready to teach a class
[SPEAKER_00]: called the science of cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be taught through Utah State
University Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an online class.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tuition is it's it's 30 lectures,
30 hours of lectures covering all aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of light and nutrition for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tuition is going to be $950 for this
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taught by myself and three other
faculty colleagues that that have done
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of research and lots of consulting in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing we're looking
forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not available yet, but we're getting
close to offering it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me know as soon as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be happy to share that out to the
audience, too, as well as a direct link to
[SPEAKER_02]: it in your pod on your podcast page.
