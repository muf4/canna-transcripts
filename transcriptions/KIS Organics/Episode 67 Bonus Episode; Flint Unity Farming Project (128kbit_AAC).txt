[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is a bit different
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a podcast on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we are facing unprecedented
times here in the United States and around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are suffering either from
economic hardship or the racial injustice
[SPEAKER_00]: that has bubbled up over the past couple
of months sparked by police brutality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not here to tell folks what to
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough of that going around these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I would suggest is that for those of
us who are fortunate enough to still have
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs and making ends meet, it's a very
good time to give back to your community
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a lot of good causes out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one that speaks to you and try to
give something back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along that vein, KISS Organics is going to
be contributing this year to the Flint
[SPEAKER_00]: University Community Farming Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder, Delmon Marshall, is my guest
this week and I was excited to have him on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show to share more about the
organization that he has founded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Delmon, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wanted to start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself and then we'll talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more about Flint, Michigan and the Unity
Project, but tell me a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well as for me, I'm an Army brat
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was in the service.
[SPEAKER_01]: His last post was Michigan, so Michigan
became our home, but we're actually from
[SPEAKER_01]: Vicksburg, Mississippi and Jackson,
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we had a farm, so farming was
just something that we were always around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but far away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a three sport athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was a tennis coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played tennis, basketball, football,
and sports is part of my life and
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture is like the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really into sports in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played in college myself and then it's
funny because most people don't associate
[SPEAKER_00]: athleticism with agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't typically go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're not opposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a funny that there is that sort
of gap there between where our food comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from and people that are really interested
in exercise and nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and it seems like they would go
together, but no, oddly not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with athletes, their optimal thing is
what they're eating in order to enhance
[SPEAKER_01]: their performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in agriculture, you're
growing what a person would be eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty much along those same
lines, like they go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our program, our youth gardening and
fitness program is to do just that,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to teach kids how to eat properly and
then exercise to fight child obesity
[SPEAKER_01]: because the overweight problem is one of
the biggest things in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: with kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to teach them how to be
responsible with their weight and with
[SPEAKER_01]: fitness at an early age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now you started the Flint Unity
Farming Project and I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, can you give listeners a
little background into Flint, Michigan?
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people have heard of the water
crisis in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like if you could just kind of
give an overview of what that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also tell us what it's like in
Flint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you know, through the water crisis
and even now, as you guys are still
[SPEAKER_00]: battling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the about
the water crisis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Flint, Michigan is probably one of
the third largest cities in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of problems that come along
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a communities of
people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from, you know, was raised here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, it is,
you know, bad things happen and that the
[SPEAKER_01]: community itself needs needs help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flint used to be a haven for NBA players,
NFL players, like back in the early 80s,
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s with Glenn Rice and Andre Risen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like since those star people
left, the city is still here and is in
[SPEAKER_01]: shambles, like is in economic shambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's to, you know,
who's who's supposed to blame for what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still people here and
everything is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the school system is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have enough money to keep the
schools open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just a real like messed up
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still have people who do not have
enough money to move away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those are the people that we're
trying to help the ones that here trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to inspire them through the bad basically
eight years of the Flint water crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take me back to the to started what in
April of 2014, Flint changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They began drawing water directly from the
Flint River for the 100,000 residents
[SPEAKER_00]: there instead of water coming from
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And residents started complaining of the
water changing and smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're reporting rashes and hair
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that like back in 2014?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would happen when it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I can't think of any other
term to use it except bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, you have people who have
no other ways of getting water or clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean water, because it was through the
whole city, through the whole pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was, it put people like you
would have to have lived through it in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to have seen it in order to know how
bad it has has been when you have kids who
[SPEAKER_01]: can't drink water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of their faucet, they can't bathe with
water that's running through the pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're five years in now, and it still
hasn't been cured yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it still hasn't been fixed
yet for the city on the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it pains me to think about,
you know, like some of the things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: saw, like from you, from working the Flint
Union farming project, I used to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: water into jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Arizona jugs to feed our plants in
Flint, because we can't use the water in
[SPEAKER_01]: Flint because the water was tainted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to bring water to feed the
plants and then bring water for some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the family kids of our kids that was in
our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just imagine that water, like you would
think clean water is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flint, Michigan hasn't had it for six
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it seems like a universal
human right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I've always taken for
granted here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really amazing water and have been
very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like from from reading
articles on this to refresh my memory that
[SPEAKER_00]: the water in the river was so caustic,
it actually stripped the lead out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: old plumbing systems and caused very high
levels, which doctors were seeing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood of children, you know, five,
10 times higher than what was known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe based on the on the levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so people were being forced to shower
and use these and then try and find other
[SPEAKER_00]: things to drink or find clean water to
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, getting back to your
nutrition thing, this is speculation on my
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was there a lot more people than
drinking soda and Arizona teas and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other really cheap yet unhealthy
beverages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, definitely, because you have to
find something to to drink because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: very unnatural to try to go without
drinking water, you know, like from a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural source, like you automatically
think you come to the sink and get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Flint, you had to learn different
ways of drinking or of getting water
[SPEAKER_01]: because clean water wasn't accessible to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people pick up and started drinking
cokes or drinking sodas or the 99 cent
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks since they like that was their
water, which I assume contributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity and diabetes and a lot of these
other challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this inspired you to start the Flint
Unity Farming Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how I found out about
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've started following me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're posting a lot of
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest people go, you know,
give it give him give him a follow and
[SPEAKER_00]: check out the Flint Unity Farming Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about what
that project is and how you got it
[SPEAKER_00]: started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flint Unity Farming Project is an army
inspired youth gardening and fitness
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, this was the idea of my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was in the service.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in Germany back in sixty five and
he was working and he had a vision of a
[SPEAKER_01]: garden gardening school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he wrote some notes down about it
and he came back, you know, was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: service and then he got out the service
and then he became a school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this garden thing was always
something that he did because we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: garden around that house like I couldn't
play the Atari video game unless I had
[SPEAKER_01]: logged in three hours of gardening time
with him outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone remember the Atari video
games, the twenty six hundred pole
[SPEAKER_01]: position, all of that, I just couldn't
play it until I got tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had to work doing out
agriculture to earn credits in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: play the video game because my dad was
just dead set on you need to know what my
[SPEAKER_01]: life was like growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the agriculture came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So December Christmas, December of 2015,
my dad, we were at McLaren Hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, do you remember I've talked
to you about that garden class?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want you to try to start it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want want you to quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to see how hard it's going
to be to set up things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from my dad and I talking in a
hospital, that's how the Flint Union
[SPEAKER_01]: farming project actually started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wrote down the core things that that we
wanted to accomplish with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually a business side to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we wrote it up, it was actually
for us to get everything that we needed so
[SPEAKER_01]: far as buying the trucks and getting
everything like on a big scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was close to seven hundred and fifty
thousand dollars like the starting in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get everything for us to have to
start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew no one was going to give us that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did was I scaled everything back
to where we don't even have a building,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to where we would be able to teach
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the business module that we
moved out out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how we got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we have been able to teach
upwards over over three hundred and fifty
[SPEAKER_01]: children free of charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just hoping to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need the resources in order to be
able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my brother, also a military
veteran army, he and I run the program
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm the more vocal focus one in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just comes in and work and then
leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we're that's basically our
program of teaching kids how to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow vegetables to help offset their
exposure from the Flint water crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for them to just learn how to be
able to eat and be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we were talking before,
you had mentioned how the there was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: an outpouring of interest in the community
when people found out about your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me about sort of what that
was like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you did some, you know,
you put up some ads and stuff initially
[SPEAKER_00]: for it, but you got a really good turnout,
you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what what did you teach the kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the focuses around the
program when everyone was showing up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, for our gardening program,
what the basis was to teach kids where
[SPEAKER_01]: plant life, what is plant life and then
how to grow vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept it elementary so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as how to what vegetables that that
we grew, because I taught them how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember the herbs,
but I thought chives and something else
[SPEAKER_01]: that was known to if you eat it,
it can all offset lead in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically taught them how to grow
basic vegetables and then how they could
[SPEAKER_01]: grow other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kept it in a one like like a ABC
format, and I tried to give them something
[SPEAKER_01]: to take home.
[SPEAKER_01]: The summer class was for eight weeks,
so I tried to have them with something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they could take home every week and
keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they could take pictures for the
kids to have phones to let me see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was basically my teaching
method was just teaching kids the basics
[SPEAKER_01]: of how to in NPK level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I teach them in NPK and I tell them
like a simple way of knowing what that
[SPEAKER_01]: means is up, down and all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I'm basically teaching them
gardening, but just doing it in such a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to where they can understand what they are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you mentioned that a lot of the
kids are were setting up gardens at their
[SPEAKER_00]: house or even in the abandoned lots or
houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of abandoned houses around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the plants that I gave kids,
they took them home and planted it either
[SPEAKER_01]: on their yard in their backyard,
or it's hundreds of vacant homes like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a house, then there's five vacant
homes and then there's a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could easily go and plant a
vegetable in a vacant lot and let it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was another part of our program
was to beautify the city of Flint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, that fell on deaf ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no one was really concerned about
beautifying Flint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was another thing that we wanted
to gear the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted them to get up to where to not
only feel good about yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but feel good about the community which
you are from and do things to better it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had mentioned that a lot of kids
didn't know about vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and it's just funny because if you
don't know, if you're not exposed to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the Amazing Grace Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was speaking at a church and I just
happened to ask the kids where the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, not even trying to be
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from Myers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, it where where does it
come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stuck at the store not even
understanding that green vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: green peppers come from the ground that
you can grow on from the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even make that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That our program was able to help kids
make that connection that you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: your own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's something that they don't even
think think man about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and living in this computer age,
everyone is basically thinking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer mind, mind frame, as opposed to
what they can actually do for them
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it just takes hard work to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a delayed satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can learn how to space it out
and do it, then you will be better off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you learn how to do it,
then you will always be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could always provide food if you
put in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals for the future with
the Flint Unity Farming Project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the goals is vast for what it is that
I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to basically get our program
sponsored or partnered with the NFL,
[SPEAKER_01]: the NBA and BBL with a base baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will want to have Flint Unity Farming
Projects in every city possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I spoke of before,
I had a friend that was out in Seattle and
[SPEAKER_01]: we were supposed to try to get one set up
in Seattle when he was there, but he got
[SPEAKER_01]: traded, traded to another team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weren't able to get that set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ultimate goal long-term is to have
this set up in 32 cities and have kids
[SPEAKER_01]: learning gardening and learning fitness,
sports training, because I want to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: them tennis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so tennis is going to be a part
of our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play tennis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played semi-pro tennis a couple
of years ago and my highest finish was
[SPEAKER_01]: third.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with coaching, but I want to
teach kids how to be able to play tennis,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to baseball, you know, basketball,
and also how to eat in order to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: better of a player and be in better
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that sounds like a very
ambitious, but worthy goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you're successful in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our part with Kiss Organics,
I'm going to send you a pallet of material
[SPEAKER_00]: from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shutting down our garden center
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a lot of extra gardening
tools and supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be sending that your way as a,
you know, sort of appreciation for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we sign off, I had a couple
more quick questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite vegetable to grow by
chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my favorite vegetable to grow
has been the bell peppers, because I cook
[SPEAKER_01]: with them so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them in like a lot of the things
that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bell peppers is my favorite thing to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must get some hot weather out there
because they're a lot tougher to grow here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no, and they're actually tough to
grow here too, because it doesn't get that
[SPEAKER_01]: warm in order form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to try my best to try my best to
grow the green, the organic green bell
[SPEAKER_01]: peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been having a success with them
and they taste wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because I grow a lot of stuff
that I don't even eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I grow strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am allergic to them, but the grandkids
love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to make a strawberry patch,
you know, for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our family, my father always plants a
garden that's way too large for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's his favorite thing to go out
in the community and share with neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his way of connecting with people
and his way of sort of giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives him a lot of joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the three years that we've been able to
run our program, the vegetables that we
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, I give them to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the families of the kids that's in
our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then any of the other ones,
I normally give them away to people or
[SPEAKER_01]: sell them to people in order for us to be
able to have resources to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the giving of the community,
knowing that you're helping someone,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving someone substance, giving,
you know, food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not any thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's better, you know,
than doing that for someone, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: this you know, today's climate and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it shows it's giving compassion
to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost seemed like that's like a
lost art of actually caring about someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now it's you just hit like on
something and then that's justification or
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, oh, well, I done enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hit like up on your post.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually you're doing something
to help another person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's life changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad, man, my dad talked to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And asked me to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do with myself,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it was inspired by your father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really cool that you have
that family part to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other last question I have for you is
when you and I were talking, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: you also have a role in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to mention that for the
listeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is area 72 botanicals on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, like that's my other job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do work in the cannabis industry and
I've started a kind of butter brand
[SPEAKER_01]: business in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been running it, you know,
for the past year and a half now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that there could be some great
