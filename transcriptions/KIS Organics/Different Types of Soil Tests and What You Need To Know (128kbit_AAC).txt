[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with KISS Organics and
I'm making this video because I see people
[SPEAKER_00]: posting photos of their plants online all
the time and asking what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see advice ranging across the
board from add Calamag, to add Molasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have a nitrogen deficiency,
but really we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where soil testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think soil testing is critical and
everyone should be doing it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most people are familiar with the
Logan Labs standard soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Malik 3 test and there's a bunch
of different tests out there in a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, but I'm just gonna explain the
comparisons between these two to keep this
[SPEAKER_00]: video short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Malik 3 test tells us everything
that's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll give us our cation exchange
capacity, our micro and macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a hundred percent accurate,
but it gives us some good range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the disadvantage of that test is it
doesn't tell us what's actually available
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where things like tissue testing,
a saturated paste test, or now this new
[SPEAKER_00]: kit from Soil Savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil test is something I've been
doing a lot of research on lately and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the entire kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a return envelope so you're not
paying for any shipping to send the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: back, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a scoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got simple instructions and this is
the whole kit right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in here is a special synthetic
resin or an artificial root.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is it slowly pulls up ions
over the course of five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells us what's actually available to
your plant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way you use a kit like this is
keep in mind everyone's room is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's growing different cultivars and
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's using different nutrients and
has different microbes cycling nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're having the best crop
you've ever grown two weeks in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you can take a Soil Savvy sample at
that stage of growth and that'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a benchmark for future growths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say the next time around you're
not getting the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if everything else is the same,
you can do the Soil Savvy test and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh well my manganese levels are lower this
time or I have too much iron and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make real-time adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to help increase your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to help with plant health
and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an all-around win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in combination with the Logan-Levin lab
test, which is going to give us everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the soil, with the Soil Savvy
test which tells us what's currently
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the plant, it allows us to
have a really good idea of the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: and mineral profiles of our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way you can use this test is
let's say you want to know how quickly a
[SPEAKER_00]: given application is actually becoming
plant available or how much of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's say for example you put out
some high P guano and you want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: when is that phosphorus actually becoming
plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you could do a test a week out and
say okay this much phosphorus is now in a
[SPEAKER_00]: form that the plant can take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really really easy simple and
fast effective way of testing your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be doing a full podcast episode
just on soil testing in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with the podcast
it's called Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Science and you can check it out right on
our website kissorganics.com and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: available on iTunes, YouTube, Stitcher,
all the major platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to say about this
soil test is we do have it available on
[SPEAKER_00]: our website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $30 with free shipping, regularly
$35.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to try this kind of
testing and compare the results,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also included a soil test of the
Logan Lab test and the Soil Savvy test
[SPEAKER_00]: right there on the product page of the
exact same sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the differences that you're
getting in these test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find it just go on to
kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in soil test into the search function
and it'll pop right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright thanks for checking out the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy growing!
you
