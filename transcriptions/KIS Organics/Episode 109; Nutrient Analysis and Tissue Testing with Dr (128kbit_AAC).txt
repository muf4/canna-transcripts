[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Dr. Carrie Peters.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the vice president at JR Peters and
the formulator of all products and
[SPEAKER_01]: development of new fertilizer formulas
that provide crop-specific solutions to
[SPEAKER_01]: growers' nutritional issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has too many honors and accolades to
list here, but I will put them up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie has a PhD in plant sciences and a
master's of science in agronomy from the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Maryland, as well as a
bachelor's of science in biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the third generation of Peters in
the family business, which was founded
[SPEAKER_01]: over 72 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Carrie, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know you've been on before talking
about JR Peters and Jaxx fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the formulation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I wanted to talk to you more about
testing and lab analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me a little bit about your lab
that you have over at Jaxx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things that I feel super
lucky to be able to have here in Allentown
[SPEAKER_00]: where we make our fertilizer is actually
the lab on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, like I was saying,
you need to come visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people that have been there,
they always kind of say like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the middle of offices is this
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is like the backbone of what
we do to manufacture fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, to make sure we are making what
we think we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also to get like really data driven
information to growers out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like any growers, not just growers using
Jaxx, but like people that are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how their plants are doing and how
to improve and optimize their crop health
[SPEAKER_00]: and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really depending on the crop that
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a pretty neat facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like smack dab in the middle of the
offices and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just completed a renovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the company was formed in 1947.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you knew that from before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our facility was built in 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lab was like a monster sized
tribute to the 70s chic, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this renovation, this renovation kind
of took us into the next, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 21st century, for sure, in the way of
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had all these state of the art
equipment and it looked like a 70s
[SPEAKER_00]: throwback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this new renovation has allowed us to
like utilize space better and really be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to increase the throughput of the
amount of samples that we do every day
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Jerry Peters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like Groundhog Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our results are out in 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you repeat that over and over
again for tissue testing, water testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: media, fertilizers, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much anything nutrient,
nutrient concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to, I want to dive into that
much deeper, but before we do something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you and I talked about in previous
off air conversations was the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: testing that goes into your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because part of our conversation was
about how, you know, when you get a label
[SPEAKER_01]: made, you have a guaranteed analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're guaranteeing 5% nitrogen,
you have to be above 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were saying within a certain range
of that too, in theory, especially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that all your inputs are free and
clean of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing not all chemical nutrient
companies have labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you guys found over the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of consistency, in order to
maintain consistency, what does that look
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wonder to myself,
like, do people know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifications their company, their
nutrient companies or anything in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like anything we put into our
bodies, what kind of testing goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: For our products, having the lab on site,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people always ask, can you send me
a certificate of analysis for your
[SPEAKER_00]: finished blends?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, can do, because that's what
everybody thinks that they need,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is super true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more important than that, we do a lot
of QAQC at the step before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we house so many different raw
materials and make so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: blends for ourselves and for others,
we look at the raw materials as input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as they're brought into the
facility, they go through a like suite of
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, one being as easy as is it clear
and soluble?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that sounds silly, but like you do
that two seconds later, if it's cloudy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just like reject that lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we look at each individual raw
material before it gets housed with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of them, because we have some large
scale containment facilities, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you put in if it's going to hold,
you know, 15,000 pounds of something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you put in 2000 pounds of a lot that isn't
wonderful or within spec, then you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated the rest of your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take it to the step where we're
doing these QAQCs at the beginning stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, you know, when it's blended,
we know 100% that it's going to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: spec in regards to heavy metal calculation
and additive value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all the different raw materials
for for the end formula certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we didn't have that on site,
I don't know what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you just like pray that it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the paperwork says it should be
this and you can't always go by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it makes me wonder as a grower
who's using, you know, mineral salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: what questions should I be asking my
manufacturer to assure that what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting is a quality product and
consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the certificate of analysis
is the number one key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if that needs to come in clean so
that your heavy metals are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: within the AFCO minimums, the American
Association of Plant Control, Plant Food
[SPEAKER_00]: Control Officials, gosh, that's what it
is, AFCO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be within their acceptable
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and you it's listed in many different
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look up fertilizers and see to say
I hear people say things are heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like almost impossible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to you always see some sort
of background noise by the time you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: a blended blended product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that end product certificate of
analysis is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other questions that I would ask would
be like, ask the technical support people
[SPEAKER_00]: like what type of grade material do you
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, a good example is potassium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, potassium nitrate is a super
important nutrient that's used as a source
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a great source of mineral
nutrients for plant growth in all
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different grades of that
material like and it's it's under this
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella of technical or greenhouse grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within that, there's like a B's
and C's of that that leads to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, heavy metal content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also leads to solubility and
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that affects pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can even see some variation in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could get some clarification
from the manufacturer on what grade of at
[SPEAKER_00]: least the macro nutrients that they're
using, I would that would give me a big
[SPEAKER_00]: boost of confidence as a grower,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my world, so I don't really have
any comments on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that's good to hear, because I
know there are people that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salts that listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure we're not just
talking to organic growers out there or
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing the concerns of organic
growers, because it's a science based
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, though, the main thing that I
want to talk to you about was these
[SPEAKER_01]: different methods of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just did a podcast talking about soil
testing with Bryant Mason, who's a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful agronomist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really we dove into the Malik
three saturated paste test and talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about what information on there and how
that applies to soil this media.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how does tissue testing play into
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why did you guys go that route?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a company, well, the whole
company started as this lab and the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to give us connections to
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we saw the problems that growers
had, that's how my grandfather was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figure out, my gosh, like I can
help them grow by bringing back these
[SPEAKER_00]: blends of mineral nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was back in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a long time ago, when when they didn't
even blend things together, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were just like putting down whatever they
want and had no regard for sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: or or anything, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we kind of based our whole
philosophy and and company philosophy on
[SPEAKER_00]: this scientific approach and kind of
having that connection to data that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can can show us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all started in the beginning with
soil testing back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like true soils with Malik three and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we moved into a fertilizer company
in the 70s, that's when they they really
[SPEAKER_00]: did a lot of the saturated paste extracts
and tried to understand the connection
[SPEAKER_00]: between the nutrients that were
immediately available in the root zone and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the nutrients that were concentrated
in the plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking that information and using
database decisions to formulate mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: blends to kind of optimize plant growth by
forming these like nutrient targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like they were back then
they were doing a lot of cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, how do we make the best
cut flowers so that it lasts longer and it
[SPEAKER_00]: blooms longer and it fulfills all of the,
you know, characteristics of this
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection of a cut flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, through the years,
all the different crops that we've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with from vegetative animal in annuals to
like just regular bedding plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: petunias to corn, soybean, cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested it in the laboratory and kind
of it gave us like this full picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: like what's going on in the plant,
what's the roots seeing and what gets
[SPEAKER_00]: translocated into the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there always a correlation between the
saturated paste, which is sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: what is in the media and immediately
available and what is in the plant tissue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it the same across various crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correlation the same across
different crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's useful to have a
database built where you can have long
[SPEAKER_00]: term data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because varieties change and like the
varieties, if you take a poinsettia,
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties from, you know, the 1940s to
something that you see today, technically
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still within the thing of poinsettia,
but it is slightly different according to
[SPEAKER_00]: these new traits that they have been
breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much similar to the things we're
seeing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're dealing with the idea of
what the original species that you had
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the, you know, 30s, 40s,
50s to the things that are even coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know, each year here as we,
you know, venture into this awesome crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to see some of the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've always been able to look at
correlations between saturated paste
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the view of our, how we build
nutrient targets, the saturated paste
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts gives you a really great like
snapshot on what's immediately available
[SPEAKER_00]: to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the nutrients and all of the
great stuff that's in the small and large
[SPEAKER_00]: pore spaces of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's immediately available to
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just saying that, that's what should be
able to be immediately taken up and
[SPEAKER_00]: translocated in the young healthy root
tissue, root tips, root hairs immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant, up the xylem and should be
for a nice healthy functioning plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translocated into the shoots, the leaves,
the growing tissues of the plant that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've always seen a correlation
between using that information and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in leaf tissue for plant
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to add that watering,
environment, transpiration, all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are going to affect how well those
nutrients are taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked that question because I have
heard a couple of people say that tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: testing doesn't correlate well with soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like what you're saying is
that there's actually a fairly strong
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation there that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things too, though,
is maybe people say that because you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have to take into consideration the
timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing immediately in the
root zone of the saturated paste isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be exactly what's in the tissue
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is like a time delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people like understand that and
they're like, oh, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally we do a tissue test is what
was in the media like five to seven days
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, depending on the crop too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the crop and the stage and
all of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some sort of time delay that
you have to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, can you give me a quick like 30
second, one minute explanation of how what
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual mechanical processes associated
with tissue testing, like what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doing when you receive a sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do like total concentration based on
leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people send us, you know, send us
several different versions of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy tissue that they're just trying to
figure out what's going on and then
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic stuff like burnt deficiencies,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like not healthy that
they're like, holy cow, what should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually send that in as like a like
fresh tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wet in a paper bag or wrapped in
towels or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we dry it overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is dried at 80 degrees Celsius,
kind of like a dehydrator type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get it nice and crunchy and really
get it down all the water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we grind that tissue into like
it's not a true powder, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty, pretty small kind of grind that's
like 40 mesh goes through a 40 mesh
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we weigh out a certain amount and
then it gets ashed overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ashing process really just removes
the carbon from the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's, you know, the purpose of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets ashed for I think it's like
four hours at like 450 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: something super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why tissue testing takes 48
hours, because there is like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and then the overnight drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that after that, it gets in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process that we do is we digest it
with a weak acid for 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that breaks down some of the,
you know, stronger bonds and materials
[SPEAKER_00]: even a little bit more into a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that gets filtered to remove some
of the bigger debris and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sample gets run on the ICP,
which is super useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an Agilent ICP at our lab here at
Jax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically gives you within 80
seconds a total nutrient concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't give you nitrogen,
but it gives you phosphorus, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and all the
micros and also silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum and sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's how it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm seeing more people talking
about sap testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about the differences between
tissue testing and sap testing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and why, why you have a preference towards
tissue testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I using the right term there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to call it tissue testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've always heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I, that's what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't a plant person, then people
get confused, but if you are, they know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people like at,
at our company, we do tech support to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize our products, but also to help
growers really get an idea of these
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient targets that they're trying to
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we run into some people that,
that taking to consideration sap analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, you know, we,
we always lean towards our version of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue testing because we have such a
strong background and knowledge on how it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to the nutrients in the root zone
and to what's being held in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and how to relate that to
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you do see people taking a
look at sap analysis to try and optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: plant nutrition at a specific time in the
plant's life, trying to understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you, you know, can they predict the
way nutrients are going to move?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that going to help kind of allow
the crop to hit its optimum before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue testing does have the limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we do is you're kind of seeing
things that already happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can, you can make really great
inferences of knowledge on the nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plant health, but it's kind of
like looking in the rear view mirror and
[SPEAKER_00]: making choices for the future from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the way of plant sap testing,
people are saying if you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can get that information correctly
and consistency, you might be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some database decisions right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I have yet to see that work
well in a, in a successful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility that, that I've
worked with yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I do hear a lot of people
are starting to lean that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, so the, the two main concerns are
one, there isn't really an existing
[SPEAKER_01]: database that would take in all of the
information that we would need because it
[SPEAKER_01]: is just a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess there's three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then how do we use that information to
make a data-driven decision moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then lastly, I would think
we would have to test quite frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: because that value is constantly changing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, in the cytosol, which is the
water inside the cell, the sap,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they, you want to try and get
an idea of what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have also juice or water sap inside
of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to make good database
decisions, I would think you really also
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay attention to how the
extraction procedure for the sap analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: is too, because you really would not want
to get the, the sap that's in the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall because that's not movable,
you know, water of nutrients, sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other great stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we want to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really only want to consider,
you know, the, the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to know how the labs do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually look at, looked at it several
times here at JR Peters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the, the extraction process
is something that can be compromised very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then you have data, but what is
that data going to give you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that it's not really giving you the
right information that you need to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision, but you're making a decision on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that decision going to be the right
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just hasn't been, it just hasn't
been around long enough to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, people definitely argue this
point with me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure people will hear this and be
like, oh, Carrie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say cytosol, is that
essentially the, the cytoplasm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same thing or is it something
different?
Yep.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sap testing is cytoplasm testing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, it's the water inside the cell,
the water consisting of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, sugars, organic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, amino acids, there's even like
remnants of enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those enzymes are the things that
catalyze those, the reactions like
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot going on in there
besides just nutrients, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like everything that makes the cell
go in liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this is a question for,
I think tissue testing or sap testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, mobile versus immobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you sampling on the plant and
how does that impact your results?
[SPEAKER_00]: For either case where you sample on the
plants, extremely important for what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we recommend getting a, the,
the leaf that's most useful is one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: most recently mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trying to see the state of
health, current health of your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to recently mature tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the oldest one, not the newest one,
the one that's basically just reached its
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then if you're having a problem
situation or you see like obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency or something, then you sample
from those parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just really trying to get
the like best status of, of your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: health, it's the recently mature tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That exact same, um, thought process would
apply to sap testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could make an argument that,
um, if you would take more of the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: from the newest leaves, the Mary stems,
the flowers, you're going to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient data that's showing movement
through the plant's phloem, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: different method than if you would take it
from older leaves or several different
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves in the, um, plant that is mostly
xylem fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like normally when you bring,
um, nutrients and water into the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes roots xylem into leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to move it around the leaves,
it moves through the phloem, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, not everything moves through
the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you get into mobile versus
immobile elements, but you can tell both
[SPEAKER_00]: of them from total tissue testing and sap
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, so, so what I'm picturing there is,
well, my brain was jumping around because
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever I hear the word phloem now,
I remember from my botany class that my
[SPEAKER_01]: professor was like phloem equals food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have that like equation stuck in
my head, a fake equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, what I was going to ask about
was I was picturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from like, in like grower terms,
the, the large, the most, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fan leaf that's like highest to the
top, that's the same size as your other
[SPEAKER_01]: fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, um, fully mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not talking about the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking about the bottom of the
plant somewhere kind of in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing middle to the upper third of
the plant that you get that like fully
[SPEAKER_01]: mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like your sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that is definitely your sweet spot
for tissue testing and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, when you see some ranges
from places, you'll see if they don't kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of say, okay, this is new growth or old
growth and they're just giving you ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always from that typical area of the
plant, regardless of the species or
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about tissue testing or just
doing more testing in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: How affordable is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how useful is that data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's say, well, I guess first
tackle that first question of
[SPEAKER_01]: affordability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, we are a full production
horticulture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get between, I mean, December and
January are one of our slowest because the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of December, I think people are just
enjoying life with the holidays and then
[SPEAKER_00]: back at it in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at that time we're getting like a
hundred samples a day, but in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thick of it all, like depending on
seasons, um, getting into like spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, typical spring we'll get up to
two 50 a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for us, the sample is $46,
um, for each sample for tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I always say, and that price has
gone up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I started, I think it was,
you know, I've been with my, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting paid by my parents since
2004, but you know, I've worked there
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but back then it was like 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's 46 and, um, but I remember
saying like, oh yeah, it's the best $46
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you'll ever spend to get your,
before you start for like, before you
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing a crop is to do a media
test, just a saturated pace to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your cocoa or, um, your living soil
or any combination of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to put together is making
sense and is hitting what you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see this with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many people get burned with
like cocoa that isn't rinsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a ton of potassium and
chloride in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you would do that $46 media
test, you figure that out in a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: super easy to remedy, but you have to
remedy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put, if you put, um, your,
your clones in there, they'll burn up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we always say like that $46 is the
best crop insurance you'll ever find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the thing with tissue testing is you
have to be ready to look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, and, and I don't know,
I guess I'm just one of those people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just not sample to collect data and
never look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try and figure out a nutrient
management program that has timed testing
[SPEAKER_00]: to points where decisions need to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for cannabis, obviously
they're, they're knowing what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important, but then taking
some samples at each stage of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: before you're making any adjustments or
changing your watering practices or your
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions or your light
levels, take some smart data points there
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can see what you're starting,
see where the plant is before you made
[SPEAKER_00]: that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two weeks after that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really at the end of the day for people
that we are really helping establish their
[SPEAKER_00]: own nutrient target, it might be 10
samples over the crop cycle at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they have their data kind of
dialed in, it can be down to like four
[SPEAKER_00]: samples based on how much effort they want
to put into looking at the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not overwhelming when it comes to
$500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives, that at least gives people an
idea of the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so let's say I get a test result
back on my tissue testing and we discover
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is low in pick your nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause that's a fairly easy one from
the organic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say your, your, your tissue shows
low in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I know it's low in potassium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I get that result back from you,
is it going to have some targets or what
[SPEAKER_01]: does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if every lab does our
lab has normal ranges that we provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's based on rolling data that we
collect here from the samples that are
[SPEAKER_00]: sent in that we do data based kind of
analysis over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it'll say, oh, this is outside
the normal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is normal limit or it's low or we
have a tech support team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people normally, when they get their
result, they'll give us a ring and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey, do you want to talk about my
results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say, yes, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of our tech support team,
you know, basically talks it through like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, why this is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something I should be concerned
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend a lot of time, which I'm sure you
do Tad too, cause this is what it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about is looking at ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is this balanced?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make a change in a potassium source
to increase potassium, is that going to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw something off that I don't want it
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting the results and looking at
them and going, Oh yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just totally wasted your time and
money pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to be able to look at
it and say, all right, this, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, I choose to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it a lot with people that have
problems too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they'll, and this is more like,
we'll take a, I don't know, a petunia
[SPEAKER_00]: grower growing like a billion flats of
petunias, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming back yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower will send all our things and
then I get the tests back and we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, let's help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's, you know, the pH is too
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's iron deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they're pale in the new
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk to the grower and go,
okay, well, this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll go, oh man, well,
I already leached and I already did this
[SPEAKER_00]: and I already did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you miss the opportunity to make
a database decision and you already did
[SPEAKER_00]: things to switch the, switch the scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, especially with a high
value crop of cannabis, it's like the last
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you want to do is be like,
let's see something starting and then have
[SPEAKER_00]: to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choosing a lab that can get you the
results quick is very important for your
[SPEAKER_00]: sanity and your non-gray hairs,
but also being able to utilize the data
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, oh my gosh, okay, so I would have
never expected this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And having someone to sit, talk it through
with you and make some recommendations is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to pay a consultant to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people should do this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That make products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do and I know we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of other companies out
there do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the cool thing about being
in cultivation of any plant is we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: here to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that doesn't happen and
there's more like competition and this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in reality growing plants should be a
community of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea that I don't know that it
works out that way in practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I, like you, I love it when
people reach out because we want to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with them and I want to know before they
do applications of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the hardest thing, like you said,
is when they see a problem, you talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem and then you find out they
already done everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I, when I see a problem,
the first thing I want to do is reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of variables in my garden because
then it allows me to figure out what that
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism is that's causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when we were talking about
potassium back there, my first thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was, oh, it's low potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe we have a watering issue
that's leaching out more potassium than we
[SPEAKER_01]: want out of that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that conversation I think can be really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not testing just for the sake of
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we want to make sure that that
testing is productive and allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a data driven decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, in our garden, ultimately,
cause that's the whole reason we test and
[SPEAKER_01]: not everyone can afford to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if you have a small garden
of 10 plants, five plants, or a vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, for example, it may not be
practical to do a bunch of tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other, there's other tools,
visual tools that we'll use in that case,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe, you know, you have a,
you have a pH meter, a good pH meter or a
[SPEAKER_01]: way to test your EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's other, other forms of testing
that don't involve lab analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to give you the same
precision of information, but at least
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, they're all tools that we can
use, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a, as a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if you don't, if you
discount any of that, the visual factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental factor, the whole
picture, you're really selling yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: short on how to grow an optimum plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think of this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now that I have, I use Waze on my
phone, you know, like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get around Waze, like Google maps or
whatever, when I drive around,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, if that app ever doesn't
work, I cannot figure out how to go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to be able to be really good at
being like, okay, I make a left over by
[SPEAKER_00]: that church, you know, and go back this
way and know the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of think of that all the time
when I look at people that really dive
[SPEAKER_00]: into so much specific nutrient information
and, and don't take into account the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: system as a whole and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do feel like tissue media,
water, nutrient testing as a whole is
[SPEAKER_00]: really useful, but if you're not really
plugged into your whole growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and everything together,
it's not going to work in to helping you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your optimum plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's all kind of pieces to a
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say this every podcast and I'm just
going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it'll just get drilled in
everyone's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the way to approach a garden or a
plant is to look at what as a detective,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the limiting factor of growth and
everyone blames the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, they blame the media,
they blame the soil, but if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: if your light levels are 500 PPFD and
flower, it's probably not your nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: program that's causing your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if your VPD is way off,
uh, as, as Nadia will tell us,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it doesn't really matter because your
plant can't translocate, uh, that calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: that it may need effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you have a massive pest issue,
as Suzanne talks about, um, those things
[SPEAKER_01]: can, all of these things can create plant
stress and manifest as nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really do have to be a detective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how many
conversations I've had with commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators where we talk about their grow
and they, not intentionally, but they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: omit information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll forget things that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our gardener applied this or, oh yeah,
we've also had a massive spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and these sorts of things are
important data points to be aware of when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really trying to look at the plant
holistically, like you talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Jax, I mean, the people that do tech
support, our tech support team,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were here and people that were
here in the past and moved on to other
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say that the most fun is
talking to people and being that little
[SPEAKER_00]: sleuth, you know, trying to figure out
like what could be the issue or how can we
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak this just a little bit to hit it
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the background, if people ask all
the time, like, how do you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing this type of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got my PhD and well,
my master's in soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned agronomy, you know,
from that side of it and then went into
[SPEAKER_00]: plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, you really just have to have
like a love for like science and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of chemistry involved, but a lot of
it's investigative reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need more of these inquisitive minds
to join tech support for people because,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a huge need for knowledgeable
individuals that aren't out there to like
[SPEAKER_00]: make a buck for themselves and just help,
you know, and that's, that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: about here at Jax, even though we do make
a lot of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why, um, you can't
really diagnose a problem from a photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a deeper conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's better if it's,
you know, accompanied by some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but we need that holistic picture to
really make a determination what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these people that, you know,
and I do this on my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I hope people, I say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use this as a diagnostic tool,
but more just a way to get your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about like, what could be a
possible source of this, um, rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: what the definitive answer is,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I think it's, it's,
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started with one with wind burn
that, uh, Nadia explained related to
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration and calcium movement,
which I thought was a really fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: plant physiology answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that's been a fun thing,
but it's not really a diagnostic tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, for our company, because tissue
testing traditionally hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've done a lot of our, uh,
recommendations based off of the saturated
[SPEAKER_01]: paste and the male like three,
and we've had good success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea though of adding in tissue
testing where, where people can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot that I'm excited
to learn around that side of things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really useful that universities
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been able to, you know, do what they are
able to do now and in their research
[SPEAKER_00]: settings, which isn't always like a
hundred percent applicable to like actual,
[SPEAKER_00]: like each growers is different,
but still being able to publish these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that have been, you know,
repeated and validated, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really good for the community to
be able to get true, um, verified data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single year you see all these
researchers coming out with fabulous
[SPEAKER_00]: things and I'm just blown away with the
science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it's getting every, like I said,
it's just getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about tissue testing,
how much, you know, you said you're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: a range, how much variability based on
genetics within cannabis do you see,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, on these tissue tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's another thing that
we should probably talk about a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That information for us is hard because we
don't, we don't always have, like when we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about customers sending in samples to
us, we don't have the information specific
[SPEAKER_00]: to that unless we're setting up,
um, research trials that we're collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: that information, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a, if a grower just wants to get
data for themselves, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: calling their sample names, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't have any idea what it is or
what genetics or much of the data that
we're collecting is going to be going to
be going to be going to get to the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to do much besides,
you know, Lumping it into this general
[SPEAKER_00]: thing of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make comments on the
variability because we really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can only do what we do with the samples
that we get here at J.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a grower, I'm just thinking out loud
here, we probably want to dial in some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our cultivars over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as we take these data points and say,
this is a, this is the, this is the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: we test with healthy plants is so if we
have like a target, then we can say this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is just vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yielded really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call this my target for this
particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we try and replicate that
essentially, or get close to that target
[SPEAKER_01]: approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we do with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll, you know, they have their
phenotypes that they're trying to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have their like, um, varieties
that are just like their number ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll dial in that to, you know,
try and establish nutrient targets to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the variability when we do
something like that still can be a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I was just working with a
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't even know if I should say
that what it is, but anyhow, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium concentration over time was so
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen this quite a bit in,
in cannabis that there's been many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many situations of like almost like
hyperaccumulation of calcium in the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, which is just like unbelievable
because you don't expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within like targeted and many,
many crop cycles of, of repetition,
[SPEAKER_00]: we still see variability from,
for these secondary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most NP and K are probably pretty
consistent from what I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less variable, but they still can
vary slightly, but it's in the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, calcium, magnesium,
and sulfur that we see the most like
[SPEAKER_00]: swings within these data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, it's just watching it over
time because these are healthy plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are hitting their yields and hitting every
single thing they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growers just trying to figure out
how to repeat that again, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see variability in healthy tissue
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes tissue just like,
sorry, one little aside to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me think like when I work with
growers that are like, I would like to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium in solution at 23.75 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, you really don't have to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do between 20 and 25 and you're
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, cause yeah,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had one last tissue testing question
before moving on to another topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was getting back to that
hypothetical of that tissue test that
[SPEAKER_01]: showed low potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we approach that in a organic
versus a hybrid versus a mineral salt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Program because that, I assume they would
be different because in my head I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, okay, as an organic grower,
I know there's more potassium potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the line from my male test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if I'm growing in cocoa with
mineral salts, I would think, or in hydro,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, I I'm out of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to just apply potassium,
but what, what do you do as an analyst on
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, and you have to remember
normally I'm doing mostly mineral and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic situations, um, like regular
cocoa too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but, um, we always look at the total
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see a tissue as low in potassium,
then we would immediately look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it, and it's not like, it's like low
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, we can't figure out why
this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would look at the, the root zone,
make sure that there's no like
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental situation that's holding
potassium kind of hostage or back or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bound with something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure the pH is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they are hitting the
moisture content so that they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a nice soil solution to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also look at the nutrient
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're using a fertilizer or a nutrient
solution, like, do you actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium in there that you think you did,
but now you really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for hydroponics, it's, it's a little
bit quicker because you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can almost eliminate certain things
and grow directly back to your nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, what are we doing and why
isn't the plant able to get the potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just backtracking to see
where in the, in the system, there could
[SPEAKER_00]: be some issues of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm wrong in this, but as an organic
grower, I just want to be aware of what my
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs into my media were at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I added, not that I use this
product much, but granulated came eggs,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, a potash, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, and it was grand in your granular
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't immediately available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not seeing it in a tissue test
yet, but I will know that it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably being broken, broken down by
microorganisms by water and that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might want to be a little more
conservative with adding something like a
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble potassium sulfate that's going to
be 50% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I don't want to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess would be my concern there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have such the potential in every
situation to react and overreact that can
[SPEAKER_00]: almost cause more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the case that you're saying with
the granular SOP sulfate, a potash,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that is, is a factor of like surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the particle size was slightly bigger
than they, they were used to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're saying it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just taking longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there, but it's just not following
the same release pattern that maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: last time you had more surface area and it
was like quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's why consideration of
everything is so important before making a
[SPEAKER_00]: rash adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can't take back, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had two other topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the next one being bricks testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm aware of bricks testing in,
um, grapes and other crops where,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the sugar level of a crop
provides greater value to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm hearing claims in cannabis
around bricks testing being useful,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, higher bricks means that you have a
plant that's going to resist pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if, if Suzanne was on here,
she'd be shaking her head and saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not true, uh, based on what
entomologists are finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll throw that out there, but there's
a lot of claims around bricks testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like pancia for like optimal
healthy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: You raise the bricks, your plants
healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's, what's really going on there
or what do you, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, unfortunately I wish I had
more like to contribute here, but as a
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulturist that does mostly nutrient
testing, we don't really look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks testing in consideration of like
trying to devise the most optimum nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, obviously when you're thinking
about what, what is the cytoplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that, what is the cell filled with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cell filled with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the cellular water components?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sugars is a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, sugars, organic acids,
aminos, enzymes, they're all in there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having them balanced together is what,
you know, boosts a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is that something that a bricks test
can, can say, okay, if it's a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks test, then your plant is,
has a more functioning metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a human, you know,
do you want your boosted metabolism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be a healthier plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel that for just making sure the
plant can complete its life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: really having a grasp on the nutrient
concentration of the plant tissue is
[SPEAKER_00]: super, super important because if you
like, you go back to your limiting factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have one of those essential
elements as missing, the plant won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to complete its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case with sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but it, they all obviously
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't know if that was the
answer you wanted to hear, Tad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't have a, I don't have a
perfect answer on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always open to learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, the way I hear from you is it's
important that we have sufficiency for
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal, um, plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, as I understand it from long
conversations with Suzanne and then with
[SPEAKER_01]: other agronomists is there's no fertility
target from a bricks perspective with this
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, it doesn't exist to my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there are, there are people making
basing all of their decisions,
[SPEAKER_01]: management decisions around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bricks levels, which at least from what
I've seen may not be, I mean, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: working for you, great, but it may not be
the best management tool compared to these
[SPEAKER_01]: other tools that we have, like tissue
testing, soil testing, um, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, plants have been grown for a long
time plant and high value crops have been
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely important in the history of our
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from the spice market to,
you know, the beginning of our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our history here in America to the stage
of what we're in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and it's, I feel thankful to be able
to be involved with, with a crop that's
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting and has all this energy and
passion into its cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cannabis has really been fun and
energizing for, I think our whole green
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do feel somehow like we get down
these wormholes of like just making it
[SPEAKER_00]: more difficult than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when in reality, like database
decisions, science, quality, consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being able to repeat what you do
and eliminate your variables of problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how you're growing will lead to
a more optimum grow a like higher quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product because you're putting the time
into consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that means you want to go down your
pathway of figuring out these little
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks and this and that, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, sometimes I feel like it's a
little more complicated than it needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as a scientist, I see it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because it is a high value crop,
uh, because it is a medicinal plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and B because people care so deeply
about how they grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we see two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of marketing that you and
I've talked about that may not reflect
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily the quality of the product or
the necessity of a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also we see, um, we just see folks
that want to do a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you think, okay, well,
my plant is this healthy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I add to make it even more
healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I think that ends up
being detrimental, but you get these like
[SPEAKER_01]: highly complex feeding schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that are product based around,
you know, I said, like, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: buzzwords out there nowadays between,
uh, amino acids and ferments and enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and these things that,
um, maybe over complicating the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's, that's my concern is,
is it's not so much that you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a healthy plant, which can happen,
but more that you're just, you're spending
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to spend to grow this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I told you before the show that I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking to a grower and he was so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just started this new facility at this
new facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, going to be using a combination of,
um, Jacks and, and actually beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he's, he sent me a text saying
that they're, they're going to save over a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred thousand dollars on their
fertility program this year, which blows
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not just the scale, but also just
that, that massive amount of costs that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're spending for essentially the same
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, which is one of the reasons I always
push against bottled nutrients is because
[SPEAKER_01]: why are we paying a company to add water
to our product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when we can do that ourselves,
you know, we're shipping and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping water around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, from a sustainability
perspective, not just for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, in shipping water,
but also for, um, our, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our, our pocketbooks, it's just not very
practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate, you know, even though I'm
organic guy, I appreciate that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: companies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are looking at more sustainable ways
to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to, to help people grow
their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's going to come down to
because we all need to improve and think
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably and, and, and not in a
wasteful manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy that even though Jacks is a
fertilizer company, we do spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time in formulation to, to, to deliver the
ratios that are not wasteful and not snake
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, like truly scientific base to try
and, you know, deliver what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people always say, well, why would you
make this fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, because of its efficiency,
you're, you know, cost and use is like
[SPEAKER_00]: three cents per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only using one bag and whatever
3000 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you did it differently,
you could sell more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, we have, at the end of
the day, what, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just have a little different kind of
mode of operation here in Allentown PA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so last topic and we're already kind
of going long as I knew we probably would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to touch on heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have time for that real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy metals, as you know, there's the
APCO standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, and we'll see those in the WSDA,
ODA, OMRI, CDFA, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll follow this standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: States, however, with cannabis do not
follow that same standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, they, they have a tighter
standard regulation in a lot of cases
[SPEAKER_01]: around heavy metals in, in flour and final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears we don't really know exactly
how much is too much arsenic or cadmium or
[SPEAKER_01]: lead in a media or in a fertilizer program
to cause a fail because of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: variability, whether that's, you know,
like we talked about lighting environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: watering pH, all of these things are going
to affect heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question, how are folks doing in
Jack's fertilizers in some of these more
[SPEAKER_01]: stringent states?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we, how as a grower,
do I avoid potential risk around heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metal failure?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool thing about, you know,
just being able to have a watchful eye
[SPEAKER_00]: over our manufacturing process is that we
get to really, you know, make sure all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our blends are as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the growers that use Jack's,
I feel like we get the comment quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have a little less stress on
their lives because they know we're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: so much attention to our inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a global market where we're
getting all of our raw materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and as COVID life really put a
strain on, you know, the timeline to get
[SPEAKER_00]: things, the sources that we could get
things from the supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even still today you're running into
some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's still COVID life,
but maybe some of the Russian Ukraine
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict that is still causing some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what for Jack's, the Jack's customers,
you know, we spend a lot of time in
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifying these raw materials to get as
little heavy metals as possible into our
[SPEAKER_00]: raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have a wonderful supply chain
person on staff that's been here for three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank goodness she came before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of took over from one of the
longer term employees and was able to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of really understand how important the
quality of our raw materials were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just wonderful because,
you know, we, you could get sources from
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different places all over the
world that looks like great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matches your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred percent with in spec of the
nutrient that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you went by their paperwork,
you would be like, great, this looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no heavy metals in this
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't test it yourself,
we test everyone in outside labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test it in our lab and an outside lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've come back with things with like
15 parts per million of lead in a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my goodness, if we would use,
you know, our micronutrients as a package
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, you know, eight different things
at a minimum, if every single one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: had 10 parts per million lead in there,
you would be over in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's super important to kind
of qualify those raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I hear a lot, just circling
back to that, is that the Jaxx growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: happy that they know that we're paying
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had many, many successful,
you know, end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been fun to be involved with
people being happy with their success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we have had people fail and
it, you know, we've helped them go down
[SPEAKER_00]: the path of like, is it the nutrients or
is it other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you hate to point
fingers anywhere, but we just try and help
[SPEAKER_00]: them figure out where it could be from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question or did I
answer one of your questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no there's no perfect
answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a grower in Massachusetts recently
that failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing in seven gallon pots
using our soil and also using a cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were adding they were
feeding on top of that with another
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, a part B nutrient, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an organic one, but they they
failed on some of their crop and the
[SPEAKER_01]: variability on the test results was all
over the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first of all, like people
automatically blame the fertilizer or the
[SPEAKER_01]: media because it's a very common source
for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do, like you said, you have to be a
detective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we got on we got on a call with
them, a long call going over all their
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went back and we start testing
all their inputs, because at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, like and no offense to you,
I shouldn't take Jaxx's word on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be testing my product because
it's it's it's I'm the one on the hook as
[SPEAKER_01]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say the same about Kiss Organic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when people tell me they've tested my
product, I good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's let's talk about the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they're high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they're low?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is this going to impact a crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it's a good conversation because
especially in organics, we're we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have heavy metals probably in levels
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely in levels higher than you
can in mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about management.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are we how much is being taken
out by the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are we putting in initially?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we're reusing that media,
what what can we add to stay below the
[SPEAKER_01]: withdrawal rate of the plant and still
pass for whatever the regular regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: body is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just even since the last time I posted
on social media about this, we found out
[SPEAKER_01]: that the pH down product they were using
was actually causing or being a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: contributor to the overall failure of
their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen this twice now with pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to caution folks on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the other one is something you don't
think about, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard that with some pH down
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the one we see quite a bit
is gypsum sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that add in gypsum as either a soil
soil stabilizer or as a source of calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: and sulfur that doesn't change pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sources of calcium sources of gypsum
are, you know, it's a function of the oh
[SPEAKER_00]: my gosh, I'm blanking out the home
building industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, drywall, you know, drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drywall is made of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever that's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drywall, wall board or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously I'm not like
renovating anything in my house here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, so it's a function of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that market doesn't care, you know,
really about the low levels of cat is
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly cadmium, cadmium and arsenic in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but then when you take it in those
fine particles, you know, and that's back
[SPEAKER_00]: to like particle size and surface area,
you can see a significant release of those
[SPEAKER_00]: materials into a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen that in like nutrient
charges and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all of these mined products,
anything coming out of the ocean is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some heavy metal load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just all about managing it
really and keeping it lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and keep in mind, too, like if I if I
register my product properly as a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer with the WSDA with CDFA and
then you can go online and look at those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, that's that's the
manufacturer submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a test that the WSDA or the
CDFA did that was independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lab test that I sent in to a lab of
my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent it back as a certified analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sent that on to the regulatory
certifying agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's really checking that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of taking your word for it,
which is scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately is a little scary, depending on
how much you trust the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've definitely seen levels that are
different than what is on the test that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're that's been submitted,
I guess, to the CDFA or what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: showing on social media versus what you're
seeing in, you know, from from the
[SPEAKER_01]: certifying agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and that's that's a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you know, you have to choose to do
business with people whose character
[SPEAKER_00]: should be reflected in their their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's the same for fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of offsite testing and we send
it into different states, all the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to register our fertilizers and
all the different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they post the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it at an offsite lab and then just
send that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how we would mess with
that, but I guess you could if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just something for people to be
aware of that a lot of this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: self-reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ODA, Oregon Department of Agriculture,
does do some independent testing that they
[SPEAKER_01]: publish, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The WSDA has done a little bit of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're testing like one percent of
the market maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not really seeing everything
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, I I really appreciate you
talking a little bit with me about heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals and soil testing and tissue
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else you wanted to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you're really excited about
upcoming in the next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having conversations with you,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know that I feel that sharing
information and, you know, talking from
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspectives really helps
everyone kind of broaden their knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing any type of crop, you know,
and contributing to horticulture as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from Jax, I mean, we're on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly looking at ways to
deliver the most efficient science based
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral fertilizers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, like, I can't wait in life
till I get to go down the path of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: more organic thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like, you know, I have a garden,
my house, like I do things a certain way
[SPEAKER_00]: here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being the chief scientist for my
family's company, it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, blinders on moving forward in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just it's been it's been a
great 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't even tell you, like,
I feel like our whole company is just so
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic to, like, see the wonderful
things that are going to happen in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate this time to chat
with you and anyone that's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love I love these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I think it's wonderful when we can come
together as a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, we all are super
passionate about growing plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully that, like you said,
shines through over all the other stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I love the idea that you're looking
into organics down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would I would love to collaborate with
you on something or figure out ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring more science to the organic
community as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of potential out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, this is
something that just would be a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: to get our brains going in that direction
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure we'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
