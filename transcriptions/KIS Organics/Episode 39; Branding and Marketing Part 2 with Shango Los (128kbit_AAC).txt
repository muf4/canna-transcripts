[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to warn listeners that today's
podcast is not about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some great guests lined up soon
for more interviews on growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but today I want to discuss another
important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone growing cannabis as a business
or working in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that having a great product or
growing top shelf cannabis is only half
[SPEAKER_00]: the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half is shaping your message in
a way to effectively reach your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, I had the pleasure today of
interviewing my good friend, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_00]: who has had his feet in both the marketing
and cannabis world for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango is the founder of Shaping Fire and
the host of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't had a chance to check it
out, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His YouTube channel features exclusive
how-to videos and expert interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango is also the founder of Vimeo,
the medical cannabis entrepreneur trade
[SPEAKER_00]: group on Vashon Island here in Washington
state, where he lives that is now involved
[SPEAKER_00]: into a patient outreach and educational
organization, hosting some of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis speakers in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to put myself in that category,
but I did have the honor of speaking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Vimeo event and that video on living
soil homegrown cannabis can be seen on his
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango has been working in brand strategy
and marketing for 25 years and since 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: has been helping cannabis entrepreneurs
bring their products to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are jumping back in with the second
half of my interview with Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of a discussion on
branding, authenticity, and creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: message in your marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually taught kind of like,
I guess like a Ted talk kind of thing at
[SPEAKER_01]: the first Green Flower Entrepreneurs
Summit about this and distilling that 20
[SPEAKER_01]: minute talk down to like a thumbnail for
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key I think is to not put up a plastic
version of what your company is,
[SPEAKER_01]: like who you are ideally, instead actually
be yourself authentically on your
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, referring back to Jeremy,
Jeremy sharing that his, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's wife or girlfriend, but his partner
was going in for the hip surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allowed the customer base to be
supportive of him and throw good vibes to
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also he's sharing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I always tell folks is when
they're developing their social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: if your company gets a new van,
take a picture of the van and put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: your social media and talk about how proud
you are of your new damn van, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's got some artwork on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a small business, buying a van
is a significant purchase and something to
[SPEAKER_01]: be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is an office dog, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a farm dog, you know, have the dog show
up occasionally in your social media
[SPEAKER_01]: because your followers will get into
relationships with the dog and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just about everybody loves
animals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So animals are an easy way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's got a birthday party at work
and maybe you guys all have barbecue
[SPEAKER_01]: sandwiches or maybe there's even a
birthday cake or whatever, you get
[SPEAKER_01]: together at lunchtime and you give a
little celebration for that coworker,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a picture of everybody smiling on the
team and put that on your Instagram or
[SPEAKER_01]: your social media of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of this is to, you know,
the corporations are not doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the large corporate agriculture
companies that are coming in, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is so polished and so formal that there's
nothing for us to lean into and to love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you do all of this human stuff
on your social media, people are more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to embrace you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that you said about
messaging, making sure you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: your messaging is really important too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna use an extreme example,
which is advanced nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, I don't take money from
synthetic bottled folks like that on my
[SPEAKER_01]: show because it's not within my values,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a living soil guy and I love talking
about regenerative agriculture with my
[SPEAKER_01]: guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not all that, but you know,
that's mostly where I go from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Big Mike, you know, the guy behind
advanced nutrients, his whole thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, exotic yachts and
helicopters and TNA and parties in LA with
[SPEAKER_01]: bikinis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it is a side of cannabis that I
absolutely do not embrace, but that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: dude who knows what his message is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those of us who don't like the sexual
objectification of women to sell cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that we have a different message.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key point I'm trying to make is know
where you are with your message and stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up for your own values, whatever they are,
even if they're values that other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, aren't going to embrace,
be true to yourself and it will come
[SPEAKER_01]: through your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we were talking about thin
slicing before, you'll find your market,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much any value that you have,
there are gonna be other people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: that value as well and they will start to
follow your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all great points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had also mentioned a couple other
companies you wanted to talk about as
[SPEAKER_00]: examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to touch on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mammoth Pea was one that you had
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yeah, Mammoth Pea is another good
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I wanted to mention Mammoth
Pea, which is a product from Mammoth
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes out of Colorado, is they did a
couple really good things early on with
[SPEAKER_01]: their brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one, you know, a lot of people,
they set up, you know, they've got their
[SPEAKER_01]: product idea, whatever it is, and then
they give it to some of their friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: their friends come back and say,
oh yeah, I loved your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like stacking the deck with your
focus group, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only let your friends trial your
product, you're not getting even answers
[SPEAKER_01]: because they want to be supportive of you
and they want you to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably want you to like them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not getting really clean
answers from your immediate peer group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're a great place to start,
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what Mammoth Pea did or what Mammoth
Microbes did is before they went to
[SPEAKER_01]: market, they took their Mammoth Pea
product and, you know, they trialed it
[SPEAKER_01]: locally with some of their friends,
but then they just spread it out all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado to people that they knew,
people that they didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave out samples all over the place
and they said, all right, everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's hear what you really have got to say
about our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was trialed all through Colorado
and they got some feedback from people,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they didn't understand how to use the
product or they were concerned about the
[SPEAKER_01]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally across the board,
people were all like, this is a damn good
[SPEAKER_01]: product that makes my plants thrive more
and I want to use it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was after they gathered that our
M &D over a broad group of people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily their friends,
it was with that confidence that they then
[SPEAKER_01]: put their next level of investment in and
started to push out nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting things about
Mammoth Microbes is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: while we all expect they will be putting
out more products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Mammoth Pea is just their flagship
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their big deal was not to grow into a
large company, meaning we employ all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these people, or to say that they're a
large company because they have all this
[SPEAKER_01]: different product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a big company because they are
all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in hydro shops in every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find that product everywhere in
all the major growing countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's through their reach, their sales
reach of availability that makes them this
[SPEAKER_01]: significant company anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really thoughtful way to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when they eventually do bring
another product to market, they've already
[SPEAKER_01]: got all those channels made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give Mammoth Microbes a thumbs up
both for growing in an inventive and
[SPEAKER_01]: metered way, and then also for being smart
enough to focus group their product with
[SPEAKER_01]: people who aren't friends before actually
going to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a little bit on the fence in
regards to samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this case, I totally agree with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked really well for Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern is that when people get
things for free, they tend to not value
[SPEAKER_00]: them as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I found with samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how many times have you come back
from a trade show with all these samples
[SPEAKER_00]: of all these products and you don't end up
even using them, which has a cost to the
[SPEAKER_00]: business that provided them to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you think maybe a little less of them
psychologically because they were free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to take that one step further,
it's kind of interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was specifically talking about
like at the focus group stage of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they could get R&D feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Microbes now gives away far fewer
samples of Mammoth Pea than they did at
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, I recently reached
out to them for an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, send samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, we don't do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the early days, they did in
Colorado and then nationally just because
[SPEAKER_01]: they were trying to get the feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you that when I'm,
you know, honestly, I go to enough trade
[SPEAKER_01]: shows now that I don't usually take
samples of stuff because then I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry that crap home with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll grab samples if they are
something that I'm already going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in 2015, I would just take
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, you know, take it all and put
it in my bag and have this heavy bag that
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would say that you want to
make sure that your money is well spent if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's your company and you are deciding
whether or not to give samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to make sure that you think
that it's part of your business model
[SPEAKER_01]: because I do agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so often the sample size
are so small that you're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be able to tell very much from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you get a sample for an A
plus B kind of thing, because you run
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro, you know, they're probably not
going to give you enough of it to really
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a small package of compost tea,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That I might be able to make, I don't
know, 10 five gallon buckets out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's plenty for a home grower and
that's probably enough for a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grower to run a test on a subset of their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really think it depends on the nature
of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost of the entry into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you use compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: My challenge there was, well, if they
didn't have a good brewer or they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have our brewer and I'm sending them a
compost tea sample, they're probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the results that I would want
them to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, a two or three hundred
dollar brewing system is not something I
[SPEAKER_00]: can sample out due to the cost of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are definitely some challenges
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the cost of your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that speaks a lot to the
problem with compost tea as a product
[SPEAKER_01]: category is that in my experience,
almost nobody uses it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's this new new to me
anyway, delineation that I learned from
[SPEAKER_01]: from column at Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said they break their cat,
their products into two categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost tea, which is brewed and then
compost extract, which is soaked out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tea bag into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one, you actually use a brewer and
you're aerating it and it's bubbling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the other one, you're just throwing
it in still water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you happen to have an
aquarium pump there, go ahead and bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: it if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it's you know, it is just supposed
to soak out of the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not supposed to actually be brewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find with especially with home
growers is they either don't have the know
[SPEAKER_01]: how or don't have the brewer themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are taking compost teas that
are designed to be brewed and using it as
[SPEAKER_01]: a compost extract and just soaking it in
water and using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it doesn't you know,
it doesn't it doesn't hurt the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it sure doesn't give you the benefits
that the product is designed to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some challenges around compost
extracts, but I don't want to I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get off the branding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, I totally agree with
what you're saying regarding samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's interesting that mammoth
pea is now sort of slowed down that
[SPEAKER_00]: process now that the the product is out
there on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems really strategic to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's worth highlighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're at it, while while while
I'm talking about stuff that Colin told me
[SPEAKER_01]: in in in an interview back a while ago,
he also said that, you know, as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up a company goes, their retailers
asked them to stop giving out so many
[SPEAKER_01]: samples because they were they were being
starting to be experienced as a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's an important thing that
that mammoth microbes was willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to feedback from their hydro store
retailers, take it to heart and to excuse
[SPEAKER_01]: me and to and to work with them to meet
their needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of the a lot of the
larger, you know, corporate nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, they don't have that
relationship with their with their retail
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the key is how do you get the
samples into the hands of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to have the product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Influencers do work, but I think you have
to be very clear on what an influencer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, if the rock was trying
if I hired the rock to sell compost tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to increase my profits
because no one believes that the rock
[SPEAKER_00]: knows anything about gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it has to fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get the product to the people
who are actually going to use the product
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because word of mouth marketing is by far
hands down been researched to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective form of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to trust your buddy who's a
grower a lot more than you would some
[SPEAKER_00]: random person, even if they're a
celebrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get the product into their
hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought this was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonah Berger and contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep talking about this book,
but it's because I'm listening to it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: third time right now just because I love
it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things he talks about is
how he gets books all the time from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, authors on on marketing and on
branding and what makes a product stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular book actually sent him
two or three copies of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, no person needs two or three copies
of the same book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that package, it said, hey,
here's a copy of our book for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like it, will you pass it on to two
or three of your friends who you also
[SPEAKER_00]: think would like this book?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's using or that this particular book
company was using him as a marketing tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an influencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to know other influencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he likes my book, he's going to share
it with these other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought that was brilliant as a
way of getting your product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't work quite as well with,
you know, a fertilizer or a product like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people would like to do that
because people are more likely to just use
[SPEAKER_00]: both samples, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is an interesting take on this idea
of word of mouth marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you've mentioned that example,
I actually think that I did listen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: contagious book because if I remember
correctly, it's about viral marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that go viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't think it's I don't think
it like that book just came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think I've listened to it because
I've I'm familiar with that example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, that particular one is
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I like your questioning of what
an influencer really is, because being an
[SPEAKER_01]: influencer is more than just having an X
number of followers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly having a lot of eyes on you
certainly increases your likelihood of
[SPEAKER_01]: being an influencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people that I follow who
have got, you know, 20 or 40,000 followers
[SPEAKER_01]: or more who I would never take their
advice on what to buy for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think they're funny.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so especially with the popularity of
cannabis memes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we probably most of us are following
one, you know, meme maker or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that that just because
they've got all these followers that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would want them to, you know, you know,
that I would want to pay them for some
[SPEAKER_01]: product I was bringing the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would want to choose an influencer that
people respect for using good products and
[SPEAKER_01]: then and then have them say, you know,
they curated this product and they like it
[SPEAKER_01]: because they, you know, they used it and
it worked for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, choose your choose your
influencers carefully, because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that that that word is is thrown around
way too, way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I wanted to mention,
again, regarding Gro Kashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this you have this Facebook
group called Pro Attic Farmers Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is what the name of it is right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started as a beta tester group,
but it's grown to 20 or 30,000 members
[SPEAKER_00]: that Alan was one of the founders of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that they talk about
in the book is how being part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: community is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I find most times is when people
ask what's the best Bokashi or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what should I be using in my
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan's not the one posting about Gro
Kashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, 30 or 40 other people in
that group that feel part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic community that are doing
probiotic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've created this term, probiotic
farming, and you've created a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: community around that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are just so excited to
share that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, so people like to feel like
they're, they have a secret, like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: part of a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York, there's this, there's this
hot dog store where you can go into any
[SPEAKER_00]: time and get any type of hot dog,
you know, anything from a breakfast dog to
[SPEAKER_00]: an old Chicago dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this little tiny hot dog store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the back of the hot dog store,
there's this old fashioned bright red
[SPEAKER_00]: telephone booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to walk into that
telephone booth and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dial the number to you, someone would pick
up the phone on the other line and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a reservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're, you're in the back
of a hot dog booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turns out what they did was they
created this bar where the only access is
[SPEAKER_00]: through this red telephone booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the name of the bar is called Please
Don't Tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this high end cocktail bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super hard to get reservations,
or at least it was at the time of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Jonah Berger writing this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, it broke every rule of marketing
in the sense that it wasn't letting people
[SPEAKER_00]: know where they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did was it created a sense of
community and it created a sense of a
[SPEAKER_00]: secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first, the first thing you want
to do when you hear a secret is you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see aspects of that with this
Facebook group in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a private group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to ask to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're a part of that community,
that community sort of functions and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitors itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it also promotes, you know,
certain products of which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gro Kashi is one of the primary ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that you shared that,
that phone booth story with me,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I forgot that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really is, they're doing it the
opposite way, you know, as a, as a form of
[SPEAKER_01]: guerrilla marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and really that's preserving one
of the values that they offer their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things they offer their
customers is being elite and that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: in the know and that this is not something
that just anybody knows about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's actually, that's really
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing, another thing about Alan and
your example that, that while he certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: teaches about Gro Kashi, you're right,
that it's usually one of his fans that is
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching, you know, in whatever thread on
how to, how to use the Gro Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think that goes back to what we
were saying earlier about being authentic
[SPEAKER_01]: in your messaging, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Alan's got people who just like
him as a human, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, he's an entrepreneur and
he's got his hustle and he's trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: support himself to like, you know,
all of us entrepreneurs are, but he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it in a way that's honorable,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, the show that,
so he, he was on my podcast and it was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the least marketing related shows I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was, he was talking about,
you know, Roman history and the use of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, lactobacillus acid to calm
soldiers who were coming back from war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh my God, this is so wildly
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're only tangentially even talking
about his product, but I get people who
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about that episode all the time,
like, oh my God, this is such an epic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, historical science episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's very, just very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, I think that it creates
in him a following that want to see him
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed and who are excited by the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're happy to, they're happy to jump
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, I actually hear that
about you too, Tad, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: being a podcast guy, I often get people
coming to me because they want to tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: about what their other favorite podcasts
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it is, it is not at all
uncommon for me to have people talk to me
[SPEAKER_01]: about you and your show or, or a recent
episode and they talk about you just like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, you're, you're one of their
friends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never met you and they've,
you know, they, maybe they've never even
[SPEAKER_01]: been to Washington where we both live,
but, but they feel like they know you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you share enough about yourself,
especially on your, your Jeff Loewenfels,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, the first one that you did with
Jeff, you know, cause you and Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Loewenfels are old family friends,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned, I learned a lot about you
and your dad and your family history from
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to that interview, which even
though you and I were already friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: it made me feel more familiar and friendly
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, like hearing you talk about
old family stuff with Jeff Loewenfels,
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like, like I was overhearing an
intimate conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be amongst friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it increased my, my connection with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody who is launching a new
company, you want to engender that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace from your target audience so that
they, they, they are interested in your
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They read more about your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they go and they purchase your
product and hopefully they become a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go and they tell their
friends and they put it on social media
[SPEAKER_01]: and they stay around and get, you know,
engage with the brand and, and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit it cause there are some anti-marketing
people who might be listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are like, you're manipulating people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and okay, maybe I am helping guide
them to an action that I would like them
[SPEAKER_01]: to take, but there's a difference between
manipulation where generally you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a situation where you're trying
to limit somebody's options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to go in your direction
versus sharing with someone openly open
[SPEAKER_01]: heartedly and giving them a new option
that is nearly irresistible because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so attractive to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they buy your product,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that is at marketing at its
best is increasing the consumers options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they feel more freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you are, you know, trying to buy
out your competitors to create a monopoly
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can do price fixing,
that's manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm, and I'm not as interested in
that kind of marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, if you can market with warmth,
stay on message so that your customers
[SPEAKER_01]: decide to choose in and participate,
you know, and then buy your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for me, I am not a marketing person
by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to try and educate myself over
the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not even a business person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's all new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from a background in special
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got my master's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't in all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, I'm, I'm taking
horticulture classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I was fortunate enough to,
well, eventually Mary recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: a marketing guru, a pretty high level of
marketing executives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's been amazing and helpful for me
in learning about marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's taking, that's taking your
recruitment very seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gives me a hard time a lot of
times about about marketing and my
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but I've, I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that came about
of this was, you know, I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: actually at Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, look, these guys have this
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all these things that they're
doing and they're doing a great job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never compete with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already have this established
following on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not, I wasn't looking to do the
exact same thing that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized, okay, maybe books are
becoming a little outdated and it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work to write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the information I'd want to
put in the book is actually stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from people in my world that I just
happen to know, like Jeff Lowenfeld,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Clackamas Koo, like my buddy Jaya and
Nelson and all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of where the idea of this
podcast came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was thinking about the
podcast, I thought I, I found,
[SPEAKER_00]: I made at least five episodes before I
ever launched and I got them where I want
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the five people that I
thought not necessarily were the most
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific, but were the five most
influential people in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, so when I got those interviews
done, I, I took them and I, as part of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go-to-market strategy,
which is a term I had to learn from my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife, essentially was I sent out to all
the people that I considered influencers
[SPEAKER_00]: and Chango, you were one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, I'm launching this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I had talked about the podcast
of launching this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what, this is who's going to
be on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be willing to share this on your
Instagram page?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I included, I learned this from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included the, you know, an example,
Instagram posts that they could edit or an
[SPEAKER_00]: example, Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very easy for them to share
the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not everyone did,
but enough people did that it got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was huge for getting
this, this whole podcast started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using the podcast as a,
as a branding tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really selling anything on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, this is sort of my platform as a way
of getting my brand out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will learn about kiss organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully if they want to support
me and there's products that we carry that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to use in their garden,
they can go on our website and purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, what I've done is with
products that I believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, I'd been using blue
mats in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, rather than, you know, going to them
and saying, Hey, do you want to sponsor
[SPEAKER_00]: this new podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, Hey, can I build this
relationship with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I sell blue mats and make just this,
you know, a small amount, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small percentage every time someone buys
them through me versus directly on your
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they were excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've done that with a lot of my
guests, but I seek out the guests around
[SPEAKER_00]: products that I believe in rather than
allowing, I've gotten a lot of requests
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to either put ads on my podcast
or to come on the podcast and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: their nutrient company or about the
products they're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always turn them down and they may
be great products, but for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be something that I've used that
I believe in, that I've researched because
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast is sort of my identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a way for me to share my belief
system with growers that are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, learning about cannabis and
science and, and these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great example of you
being very clear about what your message
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like we were talking about earlier,
you know, where you are going to draw your
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries about what you are willing and
not willing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, even though I do have ads on
the show on, on, on my shaping fire
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, weekly, I get people asking,
how much does it cost to be a guest on
[SPEAKER_01]: your show?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I always say is you cannot buy
your way onto my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, if you want to reach my audience,
I can sell you a commercial spot and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, the advertising sales team and
the editorial choices are separate
[SPEAKER_01]: departments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and what I'm glad is that no one's
asked me so far, but, but wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the advertising sales guy and I pick
the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but as a very active podcast
listener, I may not listen to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis podcasts, but I, you know,
I'm listening to four or five podcasts a
[SPEAKER_01]: day in, you know, science and philosophy
and, and, you know, news and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: other kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, if I let people be able to buy
the, becoming the guest on shaping fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: the show will feel different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is outside my boundary for
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do a show that's about,
that's intelligent and is about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, healthy cannabis, you know,
technique and growing and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if I was just saying,
okay, you give me your five grand and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can be on my show, I would suddenly just
have all these well-funded products on my
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are already shows that are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather put a little bit more
effort into targeting the advertisers that
[SPEAKER_01]: I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then reaching out to them and saying,
Hey, I love your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to have you as a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a sponsor of my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, very often I will get
people, invite people to be on my show
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and then they will eventually become
an advertiser, but it isn't, it isn't what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they were on my show and they
liked me and they liked shaping fire and
[SPEAKER_01]: they got good reaction from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all like, dude, I,
I want to be on your show continually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happens with happened with a true
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben Cassidy from true terpenes was on
my show and we became great friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once he saw the shaping fire
community, he's all like, my company wants
[SPEAKER_01]: to be associated with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've been, you know,
they've been a long time sponsor now who
[SPEAKER_01]: keep on buying new packages of commercials
because you know, our, our values and
[SPEAKER_01]: authenticity match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but it, but it wasn't that,
Oh, Ben was on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was tied to a purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was generally once people were on my
show, they tend to like me and the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they want to stay involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think that's a, I think that's
a fair way to go and, and a lot cooler
[SPEAKER_01]: than, you know, the, the, the incoming
sales queries that you and I both get
[SPEAKER_01]: where people just want to bully and buy
their way on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about some of the
mistakes you're seeing in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: here before this, before we get too long
winded on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I think we've,
we've hit a few of them already,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but I'll, I'll go through like a,
um, a top list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, uh, uh, choosing a name that
people cannot remember or spell or say,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta, you, you know, if the,
if people are going to be hearing about
[SPEAKER_01]: you for word of mouth, you've got to make
that word of mouth easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, we've already talked about,
um, if you've got a product that people
[SPEAKER_01]: actually use, you've got to focus group it
at a wider range of people than just your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends who are going to tell you they
like it probably no matter how crappy the
[SPEAKER_01]: product might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, third would be not having enough
capital to market your product after
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen plenty of people
already who they spend all their
[SPEAKER_01]: investment capital or their saved capital
on, on making the package, manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they've got cases of it and they
don't, they didn't leave any money to go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and, and do marketing or they spend
their, they spend a big portion of their
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing budget to sponsor an event.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and in most cases, sponsoring an
event is going to be your lowest bang for
[SPEAKER_01]: your buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do way, way better with,
uh, boosting an Instagram post,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and then geo locating it and targeting
it based on interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do way better spending
your money that way for a very targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people than you will,
you know, having a banner, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at some cup, um, that calls cost you,
you know, at least five figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so, so, you know, make sure
you save money to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, and then as oddly as it is,
uh, you want to make sure you don't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to control your marketing because
there's a cashflow issue that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, all product related
companies, but, but we hear, we see it a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot with, with small cannabis companies
where they, um, they are growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding so fast that they end up being
cash poor for when they need to go and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, manufacture their next round of
product or expand, um, their product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so generally it's a good idea to get
somebody in the mix who knows how to scale
[SPEAKER_01]: up companies because, you know,
certainly when people scale up wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: the company will kind of lose its soul
and, and they lose their original customer
[SPEAKER_01]: base.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with somebody with some experience who
knows how to scale up a company so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't burn out all your money and so
that you don't burn out your original
[SPEAKER_01]: followers, it can be done elegantly and
very nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last thing that I'll
mention here is, um, uh, do not put all
[SPEAKER_01]: your chips on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of folks are selling their stuff
through Amazon and Amazon has got so much
[SPEAKER_01]: trust from consumers and, and so many
people have got Amazon accounts and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: from there, but Amazon is really
difficult, uh, to work with it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: vendor, their vendor relate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they, you know, they,
they have a reputation of treating their
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors difficultly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and also there are foreign
competitors that if your product becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, they will do a knockoff off,
off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they'll even steal the copy
that you wrote on your page and they will
[SPEAKER_01]: use the same copy for a visually similar
product and put it on Amazon, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: at a lower price and you'll lose,
you'll, you'll lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another challenge with Amazon is that,
um, sometimes they'll change their
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithm by how people are found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could have a very successful
company and you're selling all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever widgets on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make a subtle in internal
algorithm change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now suddenly you're not getting the
traffic and the amount that you're selling
[SPEAKER_01]: just plummets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying don't use Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Amazon is a, is a, is a great way
to reach people, especially crossover
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is don't put all your eggs
in that basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're diversified and Amazon is
one of the ways that you distribute your
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's, that's a, that's a,
that's a, that's a quick list of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that I see people doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for specifically for cannabis growers
that are looking to improve their branding
[SPEAKER_00]: or start a new cannabis company,
uh, cannabis is becoming so popular in
[SPEAKER_00]: states that it's legalized in that you'd
really need a way to differentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to command a higher price
point in the market or make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: product is always selling, uh,
branding and marketing is, is key to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of challenges around
what you're allowed to say and do as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company, um, in terms of your
marketing, but it is something to be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something you need to start
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talked to growers in Oklahoma
about, you know, how they're setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: their growing process, I also mentioned to
them, like, what are you, what have you
[SPEAKER_00]: done on the marketing side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause even though you haven't broken
ground yet, you know, you're just looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at where, where to source these,
you know, soils and nutrients and build
[SPEAKER_00]: your greenhouses and all of these aspects,
you should already be thinking about your
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and have some of those things locked
down because it is, it's crucial to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to differentiate yourself from every
other product on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at the end of the day, cannabis is,
is subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the wine industry to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important that people are able to
create that differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that, you know,
to highlight a few people that I've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, I know I talk about gold leaf
gardens and layer at Kanigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you want to go on their Instagram,
I'll, I'll put links to it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are doing amazing job as well
with, um, visually showing a lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: around their cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, their, their slogan is grown
with Aloha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you these guys all buy in
fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it is very authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, that's so important in
this process is that, that your marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: is authentic to who you are and the
community that you're looking to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, phantom farms is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Eddie really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've done a wonderful job in
marketing their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've talked with Steve Cantwell over
at green fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't worked with him, but I can say
that just from following his Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: posts, they're very unique and,
uh, some are educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some are just showing his operation
and everything that they're doing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the last one I want to
highlight on Instagram would be freshwater
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relatively new canvas facility,
uh, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an influencer, Joshua Steensland,
who a lot of people in the living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: world know who works with them as,
as their main grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, their photos are really
interesting because they have these living
[SPEAKER_00]: beds with a cover crop that they're
posting on scale, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and their big push is that everyone said
we can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet here we are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's really fun to see these
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approaches to marketing that are all quite
different in what they're promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're all around cannabis,
but they're all very authentic to the
[SPEAKER_00]: company and that, that company's belief
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you nailed it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authenticity of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just giving us a bunch of bud
photos, which you can get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that you mentioned has got a
story and a message that's unique to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in social media marketing,
we would say that they're all creating
[SPEAKER_01]: original content and putting it out,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, uh, you know, the, I mean,
the, the Lyric Hanigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, I think they've developed the best
cannabis lifestyle brand that we've got so
[SPEAKER_01]: far in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just gorgeous and it's a good feed to
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a quality product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they, you know, between both the,
the, the high end product vibe,
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also since it's all done in
cooperation with Goldleaf, you get that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, you know, made with Aloha vibe,
which just feels good in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is a cogent message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the other examples that you gave,
um, do it solidly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to take a chance to plug
my next episode actually of shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually interviewing, uh,
Joshua Steensland tomorrow and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I'm doing a, my, my, my Christmas
show, if you will, uh, is going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, uh, probatic indoor gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, his, his, uh, poly culture
indoor beds floored me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and, you know, I, I met a lot of
conventions that Joshua is also at and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I, and I met him because he was asking
such damn good questions of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the living soil and microbe speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, who is this cat?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started following them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found my way to the,
the, the, his company website and I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the pictures and I'm like, wow,
this is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so yeah, I'm, I'm very happy to be
interviewing Joshua tomorrow and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and his episode will be coming out,
um, uh, right after I get back from
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't wait to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I don't know Joshua all that
well, but I, I started following him on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube and, uh, he's actually been using
our soils this whole time, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically created a brand around
himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just started putting up his grows on
YouTube and talking on these gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these episodes are really long
and they all showed he was very
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent about everything he was doing
in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, freshwater farms reached out
to him and hired him because he was
[SPEAKER_00]: showing these wonderful photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, let's do this on
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got in with freshwater,
uh, along, along the same lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting how he used
YouTube as a way of becoming this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis influencer around
probiotic gardening and living soils and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, building his own personal brand in
terms of his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's allowed him to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To move forward in the industry,
uh, just based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Chris Trump is another one of
those folks who, you know, Chris Trump
[SPEAKER_01]: knows a lot and he's got a lot of good
info to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but until he started making YouTube
videos, he was just kind of like one voice
[SPEAKER_01]: in the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as soon as he was on YouTube,
everyone could learn from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, um, you know, he's pretty much
the, you know, skyrocketing on that K and
[SPEAKER_01]: F tip right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can be afraid to share
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't feel like you need to keep it
all to yourself and keep it proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by sharing information, you are
establishing yourself as knowledgeable in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Chris did was he took,
well, he had success at his farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii, but he essentially took
information that he had learned from Korea
[SPEAKER_00]: that was inaccessible to a lot of people
in the United States, just cause they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know about it or they weren't able
to really research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he became the voice to where,
when you, when you think of K and F now,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's one of the main people that everyone
talks about because he's one of the few K
[SPEAKER_00]: and F followers that's willing to talk to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of been his little niche
that has been really powerful for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, uh, he has been on my show as
well, and he is such a good teacher too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's a lot of folks that are
into um, you know, some of these more
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced cannabis techniques, um,
but they don't have the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: personality which allows them to calm down
and teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris is a really good teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that really helps out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the direction that the
industry is going, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, um, you know, uh,
the, the number of people who are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to massively increase as,
as, as home grow becomes more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think that the number of plants
that's going to be the average grove is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as there's, there's more and more
people growing, you know, let's say three
[SPEAKER_01]: to 10 plants just, you know, in their
backyard during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I think that it creates this
incredible opportunity, not only for any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of education based product or
service, but also all of the tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those people are going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, and it creates a new niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily have to be talking
to the commercial growers to sell a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're going to, maybe, maybe you
don't need to sell so many five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: batches of your product to a commercial
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can sell, you know, instead 104
ounces to a hundred different people and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're making the same or similar
margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but you're, you're doing it to
regular citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular people who are at home growing
their, their handful of plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not trying to target a big commercial
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, I think it's going that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's another good thing to
point out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned, you know, how, how both
Joshua and Chris broke through on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's amazing how much more valuable
soil science and cultivation science is
[SPEAKER_01]: now than it was back in the day,
we would, we would, the only things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we would get would be high times,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd have to read the high times
articles and discern as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then rumors from like uncles and
neighbors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then the internet showed up,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, and we started, you know,
having forums and being able to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and fight a lot online and,
and, and start to learn things that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and now we've got this, this new push
of both products and information sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, where people can, uh, you know,
like it's a next wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for example, there's that,
uh, there's that traveling soil science
[SPEAKER_01]: conference that's going around,
um, Joshua Rutherford from Dutch blooms
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on it's that, uh, regenerative
organic cannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so he's, he's taking this event
across the country, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts in Humboldt and then it goes to
like the Canada and Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main, and the idea that,
that there is a cannabis related soil
[SPEAKER_01]: science traveling education circus going
across the country with like really kick
[SPEAKER_01]: ass speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them like, like, uh, you know,
Kevin Jodry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wow, what a great thing for,
you know, folks in Michigan to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get Kevin Jodry in person, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the fact that these types of
things, um, are legal enough to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that they can take soil science on
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's just good, good for
everybody, especially if it gets people to
[SPEAKER_01]: move towards living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was another one called the
living soil symposium with Chris Jagger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually came on my podcast and we
were talking about it, um, among other
[SPEAKER_00]: things around hemp farming, but,
um, the living soil symposium was held
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Oregon, but he was looking at
maybe establishing small communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like Ted X talks where where local
communities could host this living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: symposium, you know, in their area and
then bring in experts to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or even people in the industry as a
way of creating discourse around a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these organic and regenerative
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but one thing that you, you kind of
brought up or popped into my head
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding all of this is there is a lot of
marketing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different, um,
experts and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an abundance of resources now
and information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone has a different way of
cultivation or, um, different way of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really, really challenging
before, like you said, it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the problem of sifting through
all of this information and sifting
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of these experts and figuring
out what, what is really accurate and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found with, you know, having a
cannabis potter, a podcast that's focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on science, there's a lot of people using
the word science, um, incorrectly or not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what science really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of pseudoscience out
there too, where people are couching
[SPEAKER_00]: things in a way that seems scientific,
but yet doesn't really have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, uh, methodology around it,
but the claims that they're making sound
[SPEAKER_00]: really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to caution listeners to,
you know, do a little research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't accept things, uh, from experts or
from people, uh, as at face value,
[SPEAKER_00]: because at the end of the day,
they're marketing themselves, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: branding themselves too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, if we're talking about
speakers, but if we're talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: product too, like their goal is to sell
you that product or their goal is to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: you their method of cultivation or,
or whatever we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all marketing at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to just be aware and do our own
research, um, around these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't get taken, you know,
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have seen, I'm seeing that at its
most ugly, uh, in the CBD isolate market
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to see, to see some of these,
uh, CBD from fiber hemp companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, marketing their products, uh,
you know, intentionally using words like
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum in accurately and,
and feeding lines about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system that are just
factually untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's no, no enforcement about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say that, you know,
anybody, whether, whether you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're consuming information to grow or
consuming information to buy a,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to, um, to buy a product, you know,
make sure you do your homework and all
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing is trying to influence you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be unduly influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear a claim that sounds crazy,
it probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I heard one, uh, I just heard a couple
the other day that I want to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a soil company claiming that,
um, essentially if you use their super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, um, you would, you would not need to
use any fertilizer and, um, you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in any size container and, uh,
it'll end up, you know, it'll end up
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that claim to me was just crazy
because there's so many other factors
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in terms of your lighting,
your watering, all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their thing was just, Nope,
you use our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a great crop every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one I heard recently was
that if you get the biology right in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, you no longer will have to deal with
weeds and you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't need to have any other
inputs moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the, you know, your, your bacterial
to fungal ratio is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me was another one that's just
illogical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's no, uh, actual science
behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just have to be really careful with
what we're falling into when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: information and sort out these claims is
all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that it's really funny that,
that you and I just did, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our podcast on marketing and how to do
it and how to do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're ending the show on a quick
discussion about not believing marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: and making sure you're doing homework
because they're all a bunch of liars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, you know, it's, uh,
I think that, I think that's why we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to remain authentic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, have people, um, uh, trust us more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're more likely to take our word
for it and to, uh, you know, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do marketing, especially
aggressive marketing, uh, do it with honor
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure you remember that you are in
service to your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in service to your customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not about the hustle to create a
win-lose relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always be looking to create a win-win
relationship with your customers and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and you'll keep them coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the perfect place to,
uh, sign off on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I really appreciate you taking
the time today to share a lot of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these tips and pointers and give some
structure to people who are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about, um, branding and,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you, um, do you have any
recommendations for resources to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: end, end this off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, actually the, the resources that
you've already dropped that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to give links to, I think, I think are,
are going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, so, so I don't think I'm going to
give that, but, uh, I will go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: plug the links where people can,
uh, watch the videos and the interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've done on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you know, when I go around to
conventions, uh, I often moderate panels
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and speak, but any time I go,
anytime I'm in the room, I record the
[SPEAKER_01]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a whole bunch of really
great, uh, living soil talks and Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowenfels and, and, uh, oh my gosh,
there, I think we're up to like 120 videos
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and a lot of them are me recording
stuff at conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then a lot of them are me talking with
people outside after they're done talking,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and asking them some other questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the continuing to educate
yourself tip goes, um, I recommend that
[SPEAKER_01]: folks check out the youtube.com forward
slash shango lows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can also, if you just remember
shaping fire and you don't remember my
[SPEAKER_01]: name, you can just, uh, search shaping
fire in YouTube and it'll take you right
[SPEAKER_01]: to it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course the podcast,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I put a lot of work in it and,
And, and you're going to get clean
[SPEAKER_01]: information that respects your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't, I don't spend time on the
show, you know, getting high and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about what I'm smoking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, I figure that if you're listening to
my show, you are, you are busy,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably an entrepreneur or at least a
hardcore cannabis enthusiast and your time
[SPEAKER_01]: is worthy of being respected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you, you get out, you listen to
one of my shows, we get it, we get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point, you learn some stuff and we're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, you can check that out at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll have all the links to all of this
on the podcast page for people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you haven't listened to it,
one of my favorite shaping fire episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: is the one you did on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I found that to be fascinating and
I was just telling someone about that last
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they haven't checked out your,
your podcast, it's something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for having me on
the show, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been great to spend some time
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
