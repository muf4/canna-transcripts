[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and drawn top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're enjoying these podcasts,
please take a moment to subscribe to our
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter on our homepage to stay up to

[SPEAKER_00]: announcements, and videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this week's podcast was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my podcasts can get more technical
or science focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for this podcast, I wanted to
talk directly with a grower to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: hands-on experience and knowledge from
someone in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the honor of sitting down with my
good friend, Nate Gibbs, owner of Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf Gardens, a tier two producer here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold leaf is an excellent proof of concept
for living soils and this style of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known for having some of the top
shelf flower in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast was my first attempt at a
video podcast and we shot it in origins
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop, which is right next door to
origins cannabis shop, a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: store here in Washington state that is
taking a unique approach to selling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis by focusing on the customer
experience and selecting the right product
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the CBD to THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start by saying I'm not a tech guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last podcast, the volume levels were
off and I'm constantly making improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: to the recording process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that this can be a learning
experience too, but I apologize in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: for the echo as the empty coffee shop
added an echo to this particular podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I haven't been able to get the
audio and video to sync properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to make a short YouTube video
with photos and video from Gold Leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens that is available on the kiss
organics YouTube channel or on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: page for your viewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're local to Redmond,
Washington, you can swing down to origins
[SPEAKER_00]: in Redmond on four 20 this year to meet
the gold leaf crew live and see the new
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop and cannabis store.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they will be having a luau from four to
seven PM and you can check it out for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to see more of what gold
leaf is doing, you can check out their
[SPEAKER_00]: website at www gold leaf gardens.com or on
Instagram at at gold leaf gardens for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to see the inside of
origins, go to www origins cannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom of the homepage,
they have a video tour of the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today with Nate Gibbs doing our
very first live video podcast here in
[SPEAKER_00]: origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're opening a new coffee shop right
behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not open yet, but it'll be opening
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a recreational cannabis shop
next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new way of sharing and showing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take you guys over there with the
camera afterwards at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching on the YouTube channel
now, Nate here, is a tier two cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows organically and is someone that I
met quite a while ago, but what Nate's,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're known for is with gold leaf
gardens is having the highest quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: a top shelf cannabis here in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some samples here,
which I'll zoom in a little bit of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Nate, can you talk a little bit about
your history and tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you got into growing cannabis
originally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're grateful for where it's come to now,
just to be in a place like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: out here in public with amazing,
beautiful stores, our products displayed
[SPEAKER_02]: on the shelves and on TV screens,
and just to have the sort of environment
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to showcase the work that we're
doing at Gold Leaf Gardens and Polar Ice
[SPEAKER_02]: Tracks and Lyric Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long, unimaginable way away from
the dingy five foot high basements that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were starting off in a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about when we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I met you, it was working in
collaboration on a potential project that
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend of ours was looking to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, at the time, had a 100 light
facility on the medical side that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you talk a little bit about
that process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to skip over a lot of details,
but starting from just the early
[SPEAKER_02]: grassroots cooperative patient to patient
care provider model here in Washington
[SPEAKER_02]: state, one person growing for a couple of
patients in their basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sort of moved from there into opening
our own dispensary, where we worked with a
[SPEAKER_02]: collective of growers and a larger
collective of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, we outgrew our home grow
operations and moved into our first
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse, which, like you said,
was about a 100 light warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a big step.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time, Washington state laws were
still a little bit ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were taking a sort of progressive
interpretation of the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, nobody knew day in,
day out if you were going to get shut down
[SPEAKER_02]: and have everything seized, or if you were
positioning yourself to become part of
[SPEAKER_02]: this burgeoning legal markets that was
beginning to become legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we met.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, we were looking at how we
were going to transition from the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: days, the medical model, into the
recreational model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody was ambitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future was very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of big money going
around to finance very large, ambitious
[SPEAKER_02]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we were working on something
that was probably 10 times as big as we
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up landing it with now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the best thing that happened from that
was really meeting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were beginning to come into our own as
organic growers, following that path from
[SPEAKER_02]: just figuring it out on our own to
starting to realize that was the direction
[SPEAKER_02]: that produced the best products and was
most in line with our values.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't really know what we were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit more about how you
learned how to grow at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, there wasn't a lot of
information available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your source of information?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was not a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time, we were nervous about even
logging onto computers to search for info.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it all felt that illicit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, I'd go to the used book
stores and get these old tattered copies
[SPEAKER_02]: of Ed Rosenthal book, How to Grow
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a small network of people that we
would share ideas about what worked or
[SPEAKER_02]: what didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the local hydroponics
store, which was sort of this hub of where
[SPEAKER_02]: growers would go and cross-pollinate
ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, you couldn't tell anybody what
you were growing, what everybody knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you sort of had this little dance you
had to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I remember I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, if there was a new product on
the shelf that offered to boost my yields
[SPEAKER_02]: or boost my flavors or fix my mites or
anything, I think I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was about the time I ran to keep
it simple, which was sort of the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite philosophy I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was keeping it complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny, because we had
completely different upbringings in ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we ended up around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I had no experience with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with my parents owning a nursery
and landscaping business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was around plants my entire life,
but never cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I had never been to a hydro
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I walked into a hydro shop,
I was like, what are all these products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really intimidating for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never seen fertilizer was like a bag
with a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and three numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no hot chick in a bikini or
these fake monster plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen the word bud so much
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my dad and my mom sold their nursery
and leased the land out to the company
[SPEAKER_00]: they sold it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did that, my dad decided he
wanted to start a compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was way back in 1999 when that
whole industry was just starting out with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had this compost tea business
that was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came back from Australia and started
helping him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd get these phone calls from guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, yeah, I got 20 tomato
plants in my basement that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, these guys really like
their pasta sauce, before I figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were actually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started googling compost tea and
found some forums online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with the forums, you're right,
there was a lot of misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of that, it did feel a little
illicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little scary what direction the
industry was heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I'd been working and
learning about soils and just getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis myself and started working with
Jaya Palmer in regards to testing out
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil recipes and seeing how we
could grow the plants more organically and
[SPEAKER_00]: without all of these other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jaya was really instrumental in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun getting to learn about
an entirely new plant and learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow indoors is totally different than
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the higher value of the crop allows
you to really experiment with inputs that
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't make sense if you're actually
growing tomatoes or you're growing cabbage
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it opens up a whole other
realm of, well, if we can absorb these
[SPEAKER_02]: input costs, how to really maximize this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A 10% yield in a cannabis harvest could be
thousands and thousands of dollars,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's part of what drives
that cannabis nutrient market of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: always sell you more and more,
some of which works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of which doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we originally were working on the
soils that I thought was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting was the goal initially was not
a commercial application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to create a product where a cancer
patient or a medical patient could walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into a hydroshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than getting hit with all of
these bottles and nutrient lines and this
[SPEAKER_00]: craziness, they could just take a bag of
soil and walk out the door and just water
[SPEAKER_00]: their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jaya was able to start figuring
out some of these commercial applications
[SPEAKER_00]: on scale, which was when we met you and
you were doing some of our first trials
[SPEAKER_00]: too with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there was a learning curve
there and it didn't work quite as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were skeptical just because it
was such a different thought process than
[SPEAKER_02]: what we had been accustomed to in terms of
buying a lot of bottles off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you remember we had a really
complicated recipe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had this piece of paper, I remember,
that had like five milliliters of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: three milliliters of this on the fourth
day and then on the eighth day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the craziest nutrient I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plants were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were really good growers and I
think that's an important aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think what was happening,
because it was, we were successful at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you couldn't tell me that I wasn't
growing the best cannabis then,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had so many things going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would talk to all these people
and they'd say, oh, the secret ingredient
[SPEAKER_02]: is Roots Accelerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: The secret ingredient is this Bud Booster
or this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my logic was, well, if I take
everybody's secret ingredients,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's just going to have to be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you end up coming out with pretty
good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because we weren't very scientific
about it, we couldn't tell you what it was
[SPEAKER_02]: that was leading to that and what was just
more things we're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I was spending a lot of money and I
had a very complicated recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you taught me, there's a lot of
bottles of things I was greatly overpaying
[SPEAKER_02]: for because it might have been,
now I look back, it's guano suspended in
[SPEAKER_02]: water, but it's $50 a bottle instead of
the dry inputs you could buy for dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think five of the bottles you had had
the same seaweed product in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did some trials with living soils
and then decided to commit your new
[SPEAKER_00]: facility to that method of growing with
the goal of reusing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle after cycle with minimal amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what your
facility looks like now and how you set it
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember when I was kind of
modeling out the new facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was more than twice as large,
just taking our nutrient costs and putting
[SPEAKER_02]: it on paper, taking the way we were doing
things, ended up being very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was starting to have to think about
the scalability of our processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really opportune when I met you
and Jaya and you said, here's this way of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing plants which is going to let the
plants dictate what they need instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: as much of the growers manipulation of the
nutrient systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that would allow us to tend to
thousands of plants because we're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: short period of time, in a few years,
we went from a few dozen in our basement
[SPEAKER_02]: to we have four or 5,000 in our garden any
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do the same things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't give each plant the same type of
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was where the light bulbs
started to go off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also as we were going through these
trials with sort of that as the end goal,
[SPEAKER_02]: we realized we were growing some of the
best product, better than we had been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your yield wasn't necessarily any larger
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was significantly larger,
but it wasn't worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the quality was better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also too, we just found the overall
health of our gardens began to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just tack in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of being very hands on with the
nutrient regimen also meant we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: hands on with our IPM program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spraying a lot of things and
treating the soils and treating things
[SPEAKER_02]: above the ground and running to a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we really built a good living
soil environment, the plants became
[SPEAKER_02]: happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think their natural immunities began
to become fully actualized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just found ourselves fighting a lot
less problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot of emails about a blog post
I put up with actually a photo from your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility on reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a bunch of plastic pallets in,
like blue plastic pallets, which is great
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're a lot easier to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to harbor disease
like a wood pallet would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had a custom built fabric
pot, I believe, made specifically for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're on racks, so they're
raised up so you're not bending over the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about how many
rooms, how you have them set up?
[SPEAKER_02]: So our soil beds, which might be kind of a
modified version of what you and Jai have
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of designed, they sit on food grade
pallets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, we had GeoPot
design us a fabric bed that fits exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: on that pallet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the great thing about pallets,
for anybody designing a large facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there a lot of material handling
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warehouses, pallets, racking, forklifts,
everything sort of knows how to... They're
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not recreating the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not recreating the wheel,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of use that as our standard
unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, we have a soil bed with
kiss soil that we re-amand each round.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never throw it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each bed will plant six plants,
and then they'll have sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: independent trellis system per bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll use sort of a Scrog type of
training for those same six plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: share that bed and that trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just for your flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're vegging in a separate room in
smaller containers and then transplanting
[SPEAKER_02]: into the beds for their final... Yeah,
so we have one room that's a 400 square
[SPEAKER_02]: foot room that's dedicated to all of our
propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll spend a couple weeks in there in
smaller plastic pots, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: move into one of our seven production
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each room has 50 beds, and we'll plant six
plants per bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so about 300 plants,
and then they'll live the rest of their
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle in that room for about... We'll
give it about a week of transition time in
[SPEAKER_02]: that room, just because they're going
under slightly more intense lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that that's a good amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, when we harvest, we try to turn
that room over and get plants in there
[SPEAKER_02]: within a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for reusing soil, we had to really
figure out how we can thread the needle,
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest our plants, get our inputs back
into the soil, transplant in there within
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours, and then move it into the next
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when you were first doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to play around that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to put all the nutrients
back in right at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, and it was just causing the soil to
heat up from the amount of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activities going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you guys figured out was,
okay, we can put some nutrients back in
[SPEAKER_00]: then, and some organic matter,
but then we'll also top dress nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the cycle to allow you to get
that immediate 24-hour return when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start planting back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really... If you have that
downtime to let those nutrients heat up
[SPEAKER_02]: and cook in there, you lose that
production time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we loaded up the soil all the way
and transplanted, we noticed there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of transplant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found we re-amend a little lighter,
and then we'll use top dressings,
[SPEAKER_02]: water in a few things, and put some things
into the compost tea as we brew them so
[SPEAKER_02]: that they can be integrated into the
plant's life cycle throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just doing water,
you're doing other things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do other things, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of compost tea, some foliar
applications, micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some top dressing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're always experimenting with new
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that I really
like to encourage with growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one thing that you and I, you always
tell me too, is you're always trying out
[SPEAKER_00]: new things and seeing how they do with a
control, and I think that's the important
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually see, is this one
change making an improvement, or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: making things worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth the amount of time and money
I'm gonna spend on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the nice things about growing
at scale with a lot more plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more beds, everything being uniform,
the rooms all being uniform, is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: allows you to dedicate a small amount of
your canopy to these experiments without
[SPEAKER_02]: really impacting your overall production
as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was only growing 15 plants,
if I wanted to try something to five
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, enough for a decent sample size,
and it didn't work out, it really impacts
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if we wanted to try and experiment
to one or two beds, if they maybe don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get quite the returns or the results we
wanted, we're still able to absorb that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hopefully leading to improvement
year over year, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the challenges with the style of
growing that you're doing, with reusing
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, is the fact that you're not able
to fully sterilize the soil or clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so insects and diseases are,
I think, you're at higher risk for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the criticisms that I
hear from traditional agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture with this style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the ways that you guys deal with that and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your experiences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to ask you a question
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on an outdoor farm, in a greenhouse per
se, unless they're in containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're also not removing the entire
field, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this seems to be something in
respects to a container type of system
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess overwintering outside,
we don't have that going on indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, there is definitely that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we don't have the we don't
wipe the slate clean in between rounds
[SPEAKER_02]: where everything's removed and sterilized
and started over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, you do keep your facility
very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're disinfecting the room, just not the
soil and the beds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not messy when you go into gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as much as being able to have
soil, it's not like a laboratory level
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics facility like some of them
I've been into.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have we're still trying to
promote a very environment that life is
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferated and encouraged on the soil
level, robust microbial environments
[SPEAKER_02]: around the leaf surfaces as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sterile is definitely not our end goal
at any point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cleanliness is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with with, you know, with,
you know, perpetually reusing your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does force you to, you know,
really think about your environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sustainability of it over time and
your your modes of your modes of pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't you know, you can't
apply any type of product that's also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to damage the beneficial,
you know, microbes and insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we use a lot of beneficial
insects, for example, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a horticultural spray that's meant to
knock knock out pathogenic insects is also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to kill our good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to, you know, you know,
what I think, you know, we're ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: working towards is is just the the right
balance of of, you know, biology in our
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms that, you know, you're never going
to eradicate something all the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're going to you're going to keep
it under under control to where there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and when you kind of have
the right pieces in place, you find that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the gardens are sort of tend to
themselves and do as Mother Nature
[SPEAKER_02]: intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you compare it to outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about being outdoors in a
field is you can still get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this these pathogens where they
overpopulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always around just like they are
in an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that say they're mite free or I
just I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really, really hard to
achieve and maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you are able to maintain them
at a low enough level through a good IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: program to where they are very manageable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having those beneficial insects there,
I think is huge in protecting the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and having good microbiology in the soil,
you know, on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about outdoors that's so
nice is you have that diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: predators that already are naturalized to
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indoors, you just don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the ability for these pests to
really proliferate across a monocrop in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment is a lot greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about greenhouses or like
horticulture operations, I've gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: see more and more of those over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are running, you know, they may have
a thousand different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties of plants and things
that all have different insects and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they feel like the only solution is to
spray some pretty heavy pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But well, yeah, with like, for example,
our beneficial insects, we found,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think everybody's still trying
to learn how to, you know, these worlds
[SPEAKER_02]: converge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabis is so new.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we found that some things
that work on other crops for that same
[SPEAKER_02]: pest just aren't really taking hold,
you know, developing breeding populations
[SPEAKER_02]: and things in our rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it becomes sort of economically
unviable to keep using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found other things that just sort of
take root and get established.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just become part of the, you know,
the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so that's just been a lot
of experimentation, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite insect or why do
you like to add your room that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: share with listeners?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, the rove beetles,
right, you know, they're a little
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive on the front end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, you know, I don't remember the
last time we reintroduced them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you scoop up a handful of our soil,
or I mean, they even crawl, they crawl
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find them, you know, all over your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have them in the, in the old
compost too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are they coming from the old compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, those, you know,
they seem like apex predators as far as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, bugs go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I think, you know,
definitely if you don't have those
[SPEAKER_02]: established in your organic soil facility,
you know, those, those are, those are good
[SPEAKER_02]: partners to have in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and just being very prophylactic and
proactive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think kind of wheeling it back to those
early days, it was get a problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: look for a solution, try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to a bigger gun until you're pressing
the nuclear option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and now, you know, you have to
be extremely cognizant about not letting a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, you know, flare up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're constantly screening your rooms
and looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Constantly screening your rooms and you
know, one of the hardest disciplines I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is to, for example, spend money on,
on IPM for problems you don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet it's, you know, when you go back
and study all of, you know, your notes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you realize you spend much more once you
have a problem and you have to fight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and then you, you don't even think
twice about spending the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crop loss or it's spend, you know,
hundreds or thousands of dollars on a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when, when things are going
well, you know, it seems a little hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: say, oh, do I really have to, you know,
be disciplined in order my, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of dollars of beneficial insects
and keep introducing them in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you realize we haven't had a
problem in six months or three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and so, you know, I need to keep
up with that, you know, and, and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that once you're able to get from a,
you know, sort of a knockdown or a
[SPEAKER_02]: combative, you know, cycle into more of a
maintenance cycle, that's when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it gets, it actually does get
much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, so less stressful,
less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got, you got to keep, you got to keep
investing in that part of your gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, if you're going to,
especially if you're going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a reusing soil, you know,
keeping mother plants that are never,
[SPEAKER_02]: never clearing out your mother room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're always going to have,
you know, some, some plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's, there's so many aspects to
cultivation besides just growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you and I have
talked about more recently is the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: idea around lean farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have a lot of experience
with lean manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, read this book by Ben
Hartman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've sort of embraced that in your
facility a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that
experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I wouldn't, I don't know if I
would, he might be giving me too much
[SPEAKER_02]: credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been interested in the subject
and just always thinking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, running, running a production
business, you know, looking for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the right strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I've always, you know,
been very interested in how, how to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of take these methods at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've given, you know,
like Toyota this great advantage over its
[SPEAKER_02]: rivals and, and apply that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always had a hard time connecting
the dots, you know, and always kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ideas made sense on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you gave me that book by,
by Ben Hartman, I was like, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, somebody, somebody smarter than
me finally connected the dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been, you know, so we've been
going through a process at our place of
[SPEAKER_02]: removing waste, you know, and then just
really analyzing, doing a lot of deep
[SPEAKER_02]: reflection on, on every step, every touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it add value or does it not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's amazing once you sort of
take inventory of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how many things you do in a day that
aren't adding value to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to your customer at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say, why are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's a transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a transformation process that I think
is going to be going on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I, I think it's,
it's really the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially as this industry becomes highly
competitive, you know, now, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the prices of cannabis here in
Washington state and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from what we've seen in other states,
you know, are falling, getting much closer
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, representing their
manufacturing costs, not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this sort of, um, artifact of what they
used to cost in the, in the medical market
[SPEAKER_02]: or on the street before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I mean, we grow some of the,
you know, um, highest end cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_02]: market, but you know, an eighth of our
flower doesn't cost much more than what I
[SPEAKER_02]: was paying for, you know, in college 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be efficient and there's no
room for fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not taking that money home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well that's even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the customers paying the same thing
we were 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get, we get a third of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, it's, you know,
it really, you know, I think if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: running a lean operation, a very smart
operation, um, then it is hard to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I think, I think, you know,
that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yeah, it is a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it at my, on my farm,
you know, getting an employees to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on paying attention to what
they're seeing around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can keep the property cleaner and
how we can improve our processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of what we do is just so time
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we, I know we can do a better
job and I know we haven't even thought of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the ways we can do a better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not so much an end goal as
it is just a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really, I'm really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's definitely changed the way we run
our farm and my, and our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that it's, you know,
yeah, it's a Kaizen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, that improvement, you know,
that 1% improvement, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not, you're never going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to try to constantly,
you know, carve away at what doesn't need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be there and aim towards this,
this purity of, you know, uh, pure value,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, is more of a, you know,
something to aspire to than probably
[SPEAKER_02]: something you ever actually achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, in that pursuit,
you end up becoming, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming better at what you do and,
you know, um, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the, one of the traps, I think
we've seen like in, you know, probably all
[SPEAKER_02]: farming and it's starting to apply to
cannabis is that, you know, one direction
[SPEAKER_02]: people take it is to just grow larger and
larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet you'll see large scale operations
that have taken on a ton of debt to get
[SPEAKER_02]: there, not necessarily being more
profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that seems, that seems
interesting, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas that economy of scale,
but I think, you know, these type of lean,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, methods can be applied to a very small
operation or a large operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But either way, you need to, you know,
you need to be very disciplined about how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know for me, I've been a lot happier
since we started implementing this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because the mental cost of all of this
waste was just weighing me down,
[SPEAKER_00]: like walking around and seeing project
after project that need to be completed or
[SPEAKER_00]: just mess after mess that we left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it was exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just getting the stuff off the property
was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still, it's a constant battle,
but it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing directions, we've been talking
about cultivation so far, but as you well
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that's just one, one aspect of
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, you could be the best
grower in the world right now here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state and still be failing just
because there's so much more to creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and market share and interest in
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you, I want to talk a little bit
about your, uh, sort of your company
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy and the morals that you guys
stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, can we talk a little bit
about the branding and marketing aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you know, I mean, it's,
you know, everything's important now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all tied together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things are really close for what
you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I think we were a little
bit ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: In, in, in just realizing that,
you know, cannabis is going to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: turn from this sort of, you know,
anonymous, you know, anonymous commodity
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, something that was going to
look a lot more like, like products you
[SPEAKER_02]: see on the shelves in other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, kind of early on we stuck
our neck out and came up with the name
[SPEAKER_02]: gold leaf and started branding our
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um, at the time and say the
medical dispensaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you usually go in, it was kind of like a,
like purchasing books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supplies, you know, at an old general
store, you know, you have these jars and
[SPEAKER_02]: here's some, some strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily know who grew them
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so we came out kind of with a jar
with our logo on it and it said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is gold leaf weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is, you know, for better or
worse, this is, this is where it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and so we, we kind of rode that
into, you know, into the, um, the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, now of course that's how all
products are sold, but, um, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the, the, because now in
Washington, for example, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the products need to be sealed and
kept behind a, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually behind a glass counter or behind
the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the customers, um, you need to
really develop a trust with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, you know, having strong,
you know, branding and marketing to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of reinforce that those company values is,
um, is essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can be an incredible grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most coveted strains and it can just
fall flat for you because you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: that piece in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of growers in Washington
right now are producer processors as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called here are struggling to get
into new stores and get their products
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I know you guys can't even keep up
right now with the number of stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want you and want to carry
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is due to customer
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have come to, you know,
signify certain traits with the brand gold
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I want,
I want to touch on that some more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think such a big part of that is
your, the culture you've created there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the community that you guys
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you talk a little bit about sort
of, so I know I have a little background
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of unfair, but I know you guys
are for the, it started off like a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of Hawaiian guys coming out of what Kauai,
I think you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I'm from Oahu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our, you know, all of our growers
are from Kauai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, we, we have a, we have a,
it's, you know, we kind of identify as a
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously we have, you know,
we have all sorts of folks there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a, you know, we embrace that
spirit of Aloha, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of where you're born from or,
you know, what your ethnicity is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's, that's our value at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know, what,
what, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the word has a lot of different
meanings, but it means love, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and so, um, just from the love of the
plant, to the, you know, the love of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, each other, the family you work
with and your community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, growing up in, in a,
in a, you know, unique place like Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had real tight communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was a social responsibility and
that, that sort of, you know, manage how
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody interacted with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, it just seems to,
you know, it's just how we live our life
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, uh, organic growing kind of
falls in line with that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, you know, that's, that's sort
of how we run our thing, our company
[SPEAKER_02]: internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it is struck a chord with,
with people up here, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it sounds really, you know, it sounds
cliche, but you know, there's people want
[SPEAKER_02]: to know the story behind the brand and you
know, the, yeah, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, you know, I think there's
substance to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, people, you know,
you, you have this dollar in your wallet
[SPEAKER_02]: to spend and you can choose how you want
to spend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there's some folks who,
Hey, give me the most potent weed for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cheapest amount of money I can spend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've, you know, there's nothing wrong
with that, but that's not the customer
[SPEAKER_02]: that seems to be supporting our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's other ones who say,
you know, it's a good product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also too, I just love the way that,
you know, you, you guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: run your business, you know, are good
responsible members of the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give back, um, you, you grow things
responsibly when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no rule that says you have to,
but you know, we, we trust, we trust your
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know you take care of your,
your employees and, um, and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at the end of the day,
I mean, that, that adds up to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to those, um, those, those sales,
you know, which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your guys are passionate about what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, well, you know, so,
so my growers, you know, and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give them credit because,
you know, it, it all starts with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, without them, then the rest of the
businesses, you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation and, and they're almost all,
you know, brothers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, that's, that's where
they came from, where they were really
[SPEAKER_02]: relying on their land, you know,
to provide for their families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, you know, now, you know,
they've kind of, you know, migrated up
[SPEAKER_02]: here and, uh, you know, the fact they're
sort of able to do that, but in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this different market, I think is
something they're very proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and it's, and it, you know,
shows in the product, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but they take a certain pride in the
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I know this is a cultivation
science podcast, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just, there's this one thing I
haven't been able to, to sort of like
[SPEAKER_02]: quantify scientifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this, this, you know,
just this love and this passion for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for being for your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, it, it shows up in the flavor
and it just shows up in, in, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: product at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I don't know how to
replicate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know we have something really
special and, and, um, we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: let the world, you know, kind of see it
and, and, and, you know, decide if that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's for them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing we haven't mentioned
either is that your facility is fairly far
[SPEAKER_00]: south of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the guys live in Seattle,
even, uh, I think in, in North Seattle in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases and are driving all the way
down, uh, to the facility, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many miles is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's in Olympia, Washington,
and you know, it's about a 60 mile drive
[SPEAKER_02]: each way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I mean, we have most of our
employees and they make that drive both
[SPEAKER_02]: ways every day, you know, in traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spend hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're getting up at, you know,
crazy hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the opportunity to work and be a
part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, everybody has a shared,
shared, you know, sense that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: building something special and,
you know, to, you know, to come from a
[SPEAKER_02]: small place and be able to make your mark
and, you know, go into these stores and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, you know, hear the stories that,
you know, there was, there was people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were, you know, genuinely had their,
their day or their lives improved by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, by your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that, that's the kind of thing
that makes that drive worth it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, so yeah, we're just blessed
and, and, you know, we wouldn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the things that you
do, uh, at Goldleaf, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for, or with your employees that help
build that sense of community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we, I mean, even, even something as
simple as, you know, on Friday,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, you know, we, we all stop work a few
hours early and barbecue and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: become this tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I don't know how it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as long as I can remember,
we've, you know, we, we, we break a little
[SPEAKER_02]: early on Friday and we, everybody has a
potluck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um, yeah, that's kind of a
Hawaiian thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, you know, everything,
you know, kind of, you know, orbits around
[SPEAKER_02]: food and community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, it's just, you know,
it's a special time where we're able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, just reflect and,
and, you know, have your team together and
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's not work related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean,
it's, it, you know, it's the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the barbecue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they, you know, it's, it's such a
small thing, but yet I think it just helps
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody remember that like, yeah,
we're this, you know, it's this team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a, we have a greater goal and,
and, you know, we're happy to work
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started running a kiss,
we would have staff meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not all working at the same time to
where we can do these sorts of barbecues
[SPEAKER_00]: and things, but we're working on more team
building events and those opportunities to
[SPEAKER_00]: be together outside of the, you know,
outside of the workplace and not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, my, our farm manager's birthday
was last night and you know, over half the
[SPEAKER_00]: staff was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, other people, the guests were
leaving and like the staff was there
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out cause they enjoy each other's
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like some of the, some of the people
have taken trips to Iceland together or
[SPEAKER_00]: live together or have moved across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like those moments of community,
I think are so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started looking at staff
meetings, I was like, Oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calculating out how much this was
costing me per hour that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there and you know, people are
asking questions and I'm like 20 man
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is a lot of money that we could
be spent doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I matured as a leader or as a
business owner, I realized just how
[SPEAKER_00]: important this aspect was that people feel
like they're being heard, that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not spent being, you know,
stressed or working and that everyone gets
[SPEAKER_00]: along and likes each other is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and work environments can go a lot of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know there's a lot of places
where it's like, I don't want to see you
[SPEAKER_02]: till Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get out of there fast enough on
Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, but yeah, you, you nailed it dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's, um, I think it comes
down to a sense of purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and like, you know, you have not
every job at gold leaf is, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is, is glamorous as the others,
but I think that it's, it's important to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, sort of develop that
in everybody that says, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like the, there's this, um,
you know, uh, quote for the stone masons
[SPEAKER_02]: and it says, you know, we cut humble
stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone must not forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building cathedrals, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, even if you're
just trimming and I totally butcher that
[SPEAKER_02]: quote by the way, but you know,
whether you're trimming or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging or you're delivering,
you know, everybody realizes that this is
[SPEAKER_02]: all part of that, you know, that,
that customer experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think, you know, there's so much
to be learned from, from every person who
[SPEAKER_02]: works there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you and I, we both, you know,
wear a lot of hats or running our
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not always down in the
trenches, you know, at least for myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say, you know, I can't,
you know, I'm not always, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's, there's weeks I'm not even in
the gardens as much anymore because I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other things to attend to and,
um, and yet I'll find, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the person with, you know, maybe one of
the most homeless job, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: at our, at our farm will have insights
into that part of the process that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't be able to come up with,
you know, and allowing them, empowering
[SPEAKER_02]: them to say, Hey, you know, okay,
why don't you make this a process?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's not about me telling
you how to do a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's me find the right
people who want to improve this company in
[SPEAKER_02]: any way they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so giving them some, some liberty,
which, you know, it takes a certain amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of trust, but you find, I think you find
overall that when people do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that gives them a sense of
purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've improved this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've helped my company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, everybody benefited from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that, that's sort of really,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had told me, uh, another time we're
talking about one of your trimmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of told me that you have a,
you told me a story around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to share that with the
listeners?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that, uh, which one was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's probably, it probably has to
do with, you know, Sono and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's our longtime trimmer, but,
uh, and you had offered him other
[SPEAKER_00]: positions in the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, well, yeah, I mean, I've had a,
you know, an awesome kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been trimming for me for just years
and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I, you know, he's definitely
earned the right to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: move into like, you know, different jobs,
but he just kind of has this, this old
[SPEAKER_02]: soul and this, this, um, this,
you know, uh, desire, this, this,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, how should I say this affinity for
kind of, you know, there's one,
[SPEAKER_02]: the craftsmanship, you know, and this one
little thing he does, he takes his one job
[SPEAKER_02]: of trimming, which, you know, if you,
you know, trimming for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is, you know, some people think
it's like dishwashing in the restaurant
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's where you got to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, you know, he takes so much pride
in trimming a perfect flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, what he's told me
is that, you know, I mean, these growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they put in so much time and energy from,
from taking a clone and all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through it's, it's growing life and,
you know, the harvesting and the curing
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, he, it's his job to,
to give it that final manicure that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's, you know, your customers
are going to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, that pride he has in that one
simple task really embodies, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just how, you know, how we try
to do everything we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, he, he's, I don't know,
he might be a trimmer forever and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, it's, it's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he enjoys what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, he has purpose in his work
and, um, and he's quite talented at,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's good at what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even simple tasks can be part time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay him well to do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you know, I'm going to continue to
promote you, but you can still be a
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's earned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take care of folks, but if his,
you know, calling is to do that one final
[SPEAKER_02]: detail, it's like detailing a car before
you put it on the lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might not sound as cool as the guy
engineering the car, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the day, that customer is
going to want to see a nice shiny car and
[SPEAKER_02]: that might be what, what makes him
purchase it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he understands that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think that's sort of,
that's, that's definitely a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: an example for how we try to do everything
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about,
uh, where we are and sort of a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about, uh, the coffee and some of your
products and how you guys brand your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff for listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the, uh, where do I start?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're here at, you know,
origins coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's adjacent to origins recreational
cannabis shop in Redmond, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've worked with them for a long time
and we love that they sort of are thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: outside the box with how people are
interacting with cannabis as a whole and
[SPEAKER_02]: with the brands, um, in general,
you know, and it's, uh, it takes a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of creative thinking to be,
you know, to make in this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you guys partnered on this,
this coffee and can you talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about where we're starting, you know,
at the actual origin of the coffee itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and then why you're, why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it's the two things we
consume the most of is coffee and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as well, uh, get in business with both.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, um, I was, I've been
thinking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I drink a lot of coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, there's a lot of restrictions on
how I can, you know, really market and
[SPEAKER_02]: advertise my cannabis brand, you know,
just sort of what's socially responsible
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, um, you know, it's, it's an
adult product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and even the state sets some
limitations on how, how and where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: advertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, obviously, you know, I'm thinking
about our brand, you know, eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: moving into, you know, possibly other
states and, you know, internationally one
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do I begin to export that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I can't ship my, my products
across state lines, you know, and so the
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee just seemed to be something that
sort of embodied a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, similar, similar, uh,
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we, we partnered with, um,
a roastery on the big Island and there,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they work with a cooperative of,
of Kona coffee farmers, other coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers in Hawaii, you know, small farms,
small family farms, organic, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: same values we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so hopefully now, you know,
if you get a buyer or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a bag of cold gold leaf coffee and
it's excellent too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we made sure that we made
sure, Hey, if we're going to put the name
[SPEAKER_02]: on it, it's gotta be really good,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully, you know, you,
maybe you try the coffee and, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you say, wow, you know, what, what's
behind this brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, they also grow,
they also grow urban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a, just a different way of
thinking about the brand as a whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eventually, perhaps it expands
beyond just cannabis into more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle and, you know, culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys are known for your
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what's you've sort of,
uh, staked your mark on, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: produce other products as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond, uh, the flower, you're also,
can you talk a little bit about the layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of Canada guards and some of the other
products you've created to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify in this market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, we, you know,
we start off pretty much strictly selling
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we, we partnered eventually with a
concentrate maker, polar ice tracks,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we do solvent free concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, hash, rosin, um, and, um,
that's been really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been winning some awards
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just a very pure process that
involves no chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, we figured, why are you going
to grow your, your, your flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: organically and then, you know,
process it with, with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrocarbons and, you know, other
solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, uh, it's a solvent free,
you know, um, uh, concentrate processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we put them all together into
the Canada guards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is actually one of the smaller
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call this the Canada Rillo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it is a, a, basically a cannabis
cigar and, um, it's, it's our flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's wrapped in a layer of the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we take the fan leaves from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of a tobacco rap, it's,
you know, each leaf is meticulously,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, placed around that and cured and
dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole process takes months and you end
up with this, you know, kind of work of
[SPEAKER_02]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, I'll post some photos and stuff
for listeners on the podcast page,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also, um, I'll show some of the
videos that you've shared with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one of the things that I just want
to mention while we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing branding, that's so important is
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branding is not just a t-shirt or a hat or
a coffee bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of, uh, a collection of all of
these things to create an identity and a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture around what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, people have an idea of
not just where these products come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how they're grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you really have to marketing and
branding is, is a holistic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not as easy as just running
out and buying a hundred t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create that social media
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create that understanding of
what you're doing and that recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, so when someone sees that t-shirt
or that coffee or that hat, they can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that signifies this, you know,
quality community, you know, Aloha,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, whatever you're going for with
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's something that I know that
origins has worked really hard on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will, uh, I will do a video tour
in there that we'll have on YouTube as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that we can share with people so they
can see how some of the more innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: rec shops are doing things here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, um, um, I think all I can
say about it is authenticity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if you, you know, have a strong sense
of purpose in which you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: why you're doing what you're doing,
um, you kind of build your marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it'll, you know, it'll, it'll work out
well for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think if, if you're trying to put
out a message that doesn't truly represent
[SPEAKER_02]: who you are, then it's, it's just going to
kind of fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but yeah, you know, you gotta,
you gotta approach it from so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, um, and you know, it's exciting
times because there's so many platforms
[SPEAKER_02]: now to get your message out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you don't have to throw a ton of money
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the hard dollars, like you did
before, you know, taking out magazine ads
[SPEAKER_02]: and billboards and all of these,
these costs, you can be very creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you can use people to,
to spread the message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, um, nothing's better than,
you know, like a firsthand recommendation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and so those are, those are
things that, you know, you try to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point about being
authentic because we, nowadays we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: bombarded with messages all the time in
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people, even at a subconscious
level, at the very least can tell when a
[SPEAKER_00]: message is, is fake or not authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, is there anything else that you
want to touch on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
chat and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and, and, you know,
thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always appreciate your, your help with
us sort of coming into our own as,
[SPEAKER_02]: as organic growers and, and, um,
you know, we're, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I definitely know we wouldn't be
who we are and, and, and how we are if it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't for a set of our, you know,
um, opportunity to run into you at that
[SPEAKER_02]: transition time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to collaborate
with people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you and I are always learning
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I learned something new related
to soil that I think matter, would matter
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, I'm calling you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you discover something,
you know, you're sharing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how we all stay
competitive, you know, with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I, I think, I, you know,
I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's, um, you know,
there's, there's, there needs to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: unity, you know, uh, the cannabis industry
as things get competitive, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the gloves come off and it can,
it can, you know, everybody's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting for their own, but I don't think
it has to be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you look at other industries,
um, and, uh, like minded brands and come
[SPEAKER_02]: together and, um, and there's a lot,
there's a lot to go around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, looking forward to the next
chapters as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Nate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Nate Gibbs owner of gold leaf
gardens, a tier two producer here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state known for their top shelf
flower and organic methods.
