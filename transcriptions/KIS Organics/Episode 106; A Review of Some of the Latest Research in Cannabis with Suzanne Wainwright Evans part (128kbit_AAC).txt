[SPEAKER_01]: During this holiday season, I would like
to take a minute to thank all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners and guests for making this past
year so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to your continued support of the
Cannabis Cultivation and Science podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: and our advertisers, we can keep doing our
part to bridge the gap between research
[SPEAKER_01]: and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are honored that you choose to spend
time with us and we wish everyone a safe
[SPEAKER_01]: and healthy holiday season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is my good friend,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, also known by
[SPEAKER_01]: many as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary focus on biological controls and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been on the podcast multiple
times and I highly suggest folks go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and listen to some of her other podcasts
if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast, though, is a two-part series
where we discuss some of the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: research in cannabis and hemp from a
recent invite-only conference she
[SPEAKER_01]: attended.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest topics being viruses
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to mention for growers is
getting back to Guardian Mite Spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these products aren't really
regulated, growers were using it thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: it was organic, not realizing they were
spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Avamectin or Ibramectin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avamectin, it's also known as Minx II,
was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was avid mixed in and we didn't
know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were sending out samples to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people contaminated their grows
with avid without even realizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the product obviously worked really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're just trusting this company's
word until someone does independent
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until a grower in Oregon
failed, an organic grower, for having avid
[SPEAKER_01]: on their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't used anything except for this
Guardian Mite Spray that they tested it
[SPEAKER_01]: and found out and the guy got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, not in as much trouble as I
thought he should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a good lesson for growers with
these 25B products to just be really
[SPEAKER_01]: careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on that note, Suzanne, a lot of
growers, all organic guys, I see push back
[SPEAKER_01]: against using mineral oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to use a petroleum based
product, which I can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though technically, it's still mined from
the earth to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about upcycling,
it's a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy 100% wind energy for our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay more to have wind energy at our
place so that we're not paying for coal
[SPEAKER_00]: and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just bought a hybrid electric
pickup because I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, it's OK to drive
your F3 350 everywhere every day if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to get upset about using
a minimal amount of a byproduct from the
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you they use Ziploc baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just weird how we've got obsessed
with this one little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not use any other plastics in
their production facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not use hoses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not use drip line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see them bailing on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all petroleum products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are some examples of other
options growers could consider if they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't comfortable using Suf Oil X or
mineral oils in their garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the two oils we're testing right
now, I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until the triers are done,
I don't have answers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we're doing is
phytotoxicity on poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're, again, the most
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also looking at efficacy on
Lewis mites, which is a type of spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also looking at some white
fly stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're slowly getting these products
tested because many of my large or some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my larger ornamental facilities actually
have R&D departments that can do trials
[SPEAKER_00]: and research stuff because they kind of
have these rules of growers just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: take a product and go sprayed at the
facility until it clears the R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: department for phytotoxicity and efficacy
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking specifically at other oils,
I know like neem oil, caranja oil are a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple options.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are other oils out there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just they get really expensive,
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just have a few plants,
it's not going to mean much to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're OK with paying that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of in my head, I'm used to thinking
about pennies of cost and having to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: costs down on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I'm always thinking
about the economics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a home hobby grower or a
smaller production facility, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cost you that much more to use
like tetra-curb rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then with the neem oil,
you do need to wait a little longer before
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroducing beneficials versus some of
these other options based on the research
[SPEAKER_01]: you've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so neem oil is so variable
and that's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still a little, you know,
gun shy after the pesticide contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that came up with neem and
azadirachtin a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just and more likely to have
phytotoxicity issues with neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what happened was the neem
tree in India had gotten sprayed with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very old pesticide that we don't even use
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we use them here still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you said it was something that
was just so rare over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there were several different products
they hit for bifenthrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think asafate, which is orthine,
and orthine is still used here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the theory is that the trees are
because it wasn't like with the with the
[SPEAKER_00]: guardian mitosite issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentration was so high in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were opening the bottle, pouring
avidin and, you know, doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels in the neem and the
azadirachtin were frozen for a second,
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like the Internet went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what you're saying is they
were pouring the avidin to the bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I back?
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I back?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the levels that were found in these
products and, you know, it's been debated
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was it contamination at the
bottling plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they bottling bifenthrin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they switched over to bottle neem
because it was very low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, where the trees spray,
you know, there's because if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down a rabbit hole of scary pesticides,
go look at what goes on in India with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the worst stories ever read is
they sprayed tea fields and then elephants
[SPEAKER_00]: went in there and ate some of the tea and
it killed the elephants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's an edible crop,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this weird thing that,
you know, oh, we're not going to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff with Lex, but we'll buy neem oil
from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the environmental stuff
there is horrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you've got to pick and
choose your battles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be, you know, perfect at
everything all the time, environmental and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just weird to me that there's
been this pushback and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: started by one particular group of people
on using stuff oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're talking about using
a one percent in a gallon of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very small amount as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying neem oil is for everything,
but for, you know, again, hemp russet mite
[SPEAKER_00]: and spider mites, it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do targeted knockdowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with anything you do,
there is an environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be clear, like neither of us work
for or sell oil or it's a brand product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also buy it even on Amazon as
Monterey Garden or Monterey Horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its other branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a small homeowner grower,
I've tried to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I frankly can't I can't get it at a price
to where I could resell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I think it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Suzanne recommends it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Suzanne's the reason I recommend it is
just because there's a lot of research
[SPEAKER_01]: around it to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking at MJ BizCon about some
of the other products that are out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like enzyme based or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about one in particular
and you're like, oh, that's primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: citric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that a little bit in
terms of how that works or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if that might be an option for folks
that are, you know, wanting to move away
[SPEAKER_01]: from more traditional pesticide options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I kind of go back to my default
comment of if it's such an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: product, why is cannabis the only industry
that uses it and it is sold to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so you would you would could it be
the price point?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citric acid is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in like everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just mean like if you're talking
about a product that's only in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: could it be because it can't be made
affordably enough for ornamental?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to the price of ornamental
pesticides is insane these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These newer designer pesticides are so
expensive, so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by keeping the prices super high,
the growers don't overuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's cheap, people do it over
and over and over and use it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You crank that price up and then people
are very limited and then it makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: product have a longer shelf life and it
doesn't get overused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because insects don't develop
resistance as quickly because like the
[SPEAKER_00]: salt and you're only allowed on the label
I care if it's I think it's two or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: three times an entire crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you allowed to spray that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot come in and spray that once a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You one you can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, the label will not allow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way this product has persisted on
the market for years without any
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance issues where products that once
they go generic and people can buy very
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap versions of them like a metacloprid
like synthetic pyrethrins because the
[SPEAKER_00]: price point is so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just spray and spray and spray and
then we have a lot of resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high prices are a way to keep people
from overusing the products on those
[SPEAKER_00]: designer pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, remember, like at least ten million
dollars at least to develop that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you're making a citric acid,
rosemary, you know, sunflower oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in your kitchen, you don't have
ten million dollars of development in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's you look if you
actually look at the percentage of active
[SPEAKER_00]: in those what we call salad dressing
products, you know, salad dressing can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very tasty, you know, and then price it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the markup there on on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because they're putting that
money into R&D to develop new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I mean, is there research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Though on citric acid and is there what is
the mechanism of action?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think around citric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I I've not seen any research yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying it's not out there,
but I haven't gone down that rabbit hole
[SPEAKER_00]: because I will tell you, we did test one
of the popular citric acid products at one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my ornamental growers and we fried our
plants and we're like, yeah, we're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did too much at the label rate and just
labeled rate too much phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing is, is with cannabis,
cannabis, it's a it's a hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle stuff ornamental crops
cannot handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle repeated oil sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's it's pretty hard to
cause phytotoxicity with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's a it's a pretty forgiving
crop compared to orchids, poinsettias,
[SPEAKER_00]: pansies, you know, lettuce, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, because remember, you know,
I'm not just working in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working in multiple cropping systems
and, you know, trying to find things that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used safely throughout multiple
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if if spraying a citric acid
product works for you, you see efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, use it, you know, if something
works for you, I just don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: faith because of the damage I've seen and
not as good as efficacy as I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying it may kill some,
but not all of the target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also going to be spray coverage
just like anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's going to depend on the sprayer
you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I see in cannabis
is, again, cannabis farms or production
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities tend to be smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a monoculture, you got a guy
going there and spraying and he can really
[SPEAKER_00]: almost wash those plants off in some
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not the larger facilities,
but in a lot of the smaller mid-sized ones
[SPEAKER_00]: where because of the structure,
the way cannabis is, it's easy to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy to get the undersides of the
leaves where you don't necessarily get
[SPEAKER_00]: that in other crops and you don't have the
time to put into spraying like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think a lot of efficacy we see in
cannabis is the washing action of just the
[SPEAKER_00]: water carrier just blasting the pests off
the plant in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a semi I don't want to say
famous study done and they looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional pesticides, microbial
pesticides and water sprays on I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very small amount of plants,
easy to get good spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, water, bio pesticides and
conventional pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same efficacy for controlling Western
flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the washing action of the
water, I kind of got into it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher a touch on it because,
you know, go spray five acres and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you won't because you can't get that
kind of spray coverage on large acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a few plants, you absolutely
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just can't on large acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why you get different
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all based on spraying and
spraying technique and spray.
And I think that's the thing about
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple spray companies that we like,
Dramm, who's been on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: makes excellent sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their water breaker, watering wand is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Kurt Becker, I had asked him
in a in a webinar with you what other
[SPEAKER_01]: options are there, you know, for Kistram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dramm sprayers are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He mentioned Birchmeyer is another company
that he liked that made a good good
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So throwing that out there for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a good sprayer is expensive,
but it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pay for itself because I've had
growers saying that products don't close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk is the perfect one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do you spring with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And either they're using a paint sprayer
or they're using an herbicide sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something they just bought down at
Home Depot or Lowe's that is designed for
[SPEAKER_00]: lower pressure and larger particle size
with so you don't get drift because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want with herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what most homeowners want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had those girls that say Suffolk
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they move to a Dramm like
backpack sprayer, now they're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticide didn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the sprayer changed and particle
size change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm just going to say it again,
because there's this vicious rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get paid by Bioworks and I do not get
paid by Bioworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any financial affiliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take kickbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have spent my entire career working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at being poor because I don't
take kickbacks on products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they they have a nice lineup of
products for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mentioned the sprayers,
though, it made me think because I did
[SPEAKER_01]: some just direct microscopy at my house
looking at compost teas through sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before it went through a sprayer and
after and we found like certain sprayers
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely affected the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a look at an atomizer years ago and
looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically you can see the damage that
sprayers do to microbial products
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important when we're
spraying microbial products, oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things that we have the right
equipment for that spray or we may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the efficacy that we think we're
getting.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Brownbridge at Vineland Research
and Innovation has done some of that work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's looking at more commercial size
sprayers and looking at thermal foggers
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways they tested how microbial
stuff went through sprayers is you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: on Amazon and you can buy PDA plates that
are sterile and then you can set your
[SPEAKER_00]: plates out and you can spray your spray
over the top of it and cap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 24, 48 hours, your microbes
will grow on that plate to know if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: alive or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did it like Bavaria bossiana,
you should start seeing lots of little
[SPEAKER_00]: super, super white fuzz balls growing on
that plate quickly to know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing metarysium, you're going
to see like a blue green kind of fuzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to know your
microbes, know all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can easily test them with those
PDA plates from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of Bavaria, we talked
recently there's a pretty popular organic
[SPEAKER_01]: company out there selling Bavaria and you
went and actually looked at the rates on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and found it was so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no way you could get efficacy
with it, yet they're selling a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same sort of regulatory issues around
biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And EPA biopesticides are regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biostimulants currently are not really
regulated, but the EPA is going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that because everybody is cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're taking biopesticides
like Bavaria and Isaria and then diluting
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the side, they'll make
insecticidal claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in writing, they won't give you any
claims and really any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really important to be
looking at spore counts on that product to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a whole nother presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've given a couple of talks on this
around the country about how to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the spore counts, know where you need to
be, where they've shown what spore numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be at for killing certain
pests and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do your comparison between EPA
registered microbial and non EPA
[SPEAKER_00]: registered microbials on like Bavaria and
look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's telling right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen this too on the heavy metal
side with soil companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these companies claim to be really
transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when and the tests that they're
publishing and that they're doing in-house
[SPEAKER_01]: look quite good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'll have a grower fail for heavy
metals and we test the product
[SPEAKER_01]: independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes back totally different than
that one test that they showed on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to do your due
diligence around this because companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are not registering products are not
being regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not being regulated,
you're just trusting that that company is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what they're saying they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that as a grower,
that's that's sort of on you at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I tell you about the recent herbicide
scandal I heard about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in California two weeks ago,
I think it was I was talking to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Ag people and apparently
a company out of Florida was selling an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's Florida, but they sold it
to a lot of California growers and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: working so amazing and so amazing that it
kind of caught the attention of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got some product and sampled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they said it was here are 20 or 40
percent glyphosate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and this was an organic herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got these organic farms
that have sprayed Roundup not knowing it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes back to you better check
your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be great if you could
trust people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody, but a lot of people
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not looking out for your best
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you had a small organic company
and it is really screwed a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the resolution is going
to be to this because the farmer is
[SPEAKER_00]: unknowingly sprayed Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So according to the regulatory stuff,
they have to lose their certification,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day was Roundup
sprayed on that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has to lose its certification
even though it's not their fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but is it three years three
years to be completely clear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would send them back three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing, too, if you if you
and this doesn't necessarily apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because you aren't organically
certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are going to apply anything
because we have people reach out to us
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding like compost tea or humic acids
and things like that that maybe don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: an organic certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say, like, don't don't use that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put me in touch with the certifier,
get that product approved before you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it or apply it to your to your
property because of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a big concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that certifier to sign off on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually not an issue,
but you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's kosher before you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, you know, Omri is one of
the bigger third party certifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, you know,
say it's, you know, a bunch of crap that
[SPEAKER_00]: you just pay them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you, because my husband's
product is Omri listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, they are a huge pain in the ass,
but they regularly test his product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need samples of his product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test it for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test it for all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm actually surprised how
often they want to test biodegradable
[SPEAKER_00]: pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Williams got to pay for all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're doing their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do follow through with the
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you some stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, me as a consultant makes me
feel better as being married to William.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why do they do this to William
all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're just, you know, being it's
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we need that regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the companies I see selling
fertilizer haven't registered their
[SPEAKER_01]: products because I go and look WSDA CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they're just getting under
the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't have that kind of
regulatory oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we've been talking for a long
time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did say we want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even finish going through my
notes from the lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, do you want to hit a few more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just hit a few highlights into.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know us, we can talk to you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: for days about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hemp Russet mite research at Colorado
State, they basically found, and no big
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise here, Saffoil-X did very well in
their trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did Tetrakerb, which that's that
rosemary oil, which that was kind of nice
[SPEAKER_00]: to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, for Hemp Russet mite,
they got good results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see that replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more times on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also found that sulfur did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that sulfur does kill Hemp
Russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was actually doing some reading the
other day that there seems to be like this
[SPEAKER_00]: boomerang effect that they see in outdoor
sulfur use, where it actually can create
[SPEAKER_00]: more spider mite issues after sulfur
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other rabbit hole that you
can go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other really interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you move on from sulfur,
can you just give your quick 30 second PPE
[SPEAKER_01]: talk around sulfur for growers who may not
have heard it and are using sulfur or
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about using sulfur?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no doubt sulfur kills and
works well on powdery mildew, and it kills
[SPEAKER_00]: and works well on Hemp Russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not debating that ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: With sulfur, if you use the indoor labeled
greenhouse product, currently what is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market has a 24 hour reentry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've applied it, you're not
supposed to go back in there for 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: for human safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that that's a lot of time for a
facility, but the label is the law and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can mess up some of your
beneficial insects, where sulfur is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: good insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a good miticide, but not
necessarily a good insecticide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where oil products generally will either
have a zero or a four hour REI,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can kill beneficials on contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, you know, stuff oil or
products like that, once they're dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can re-release your beneficials and
you're right back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to be very careful about
the timing of sulfur applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently had a grower who they used it
in vegetative, but use it, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: too many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the persistence in the
environment indoor, their flour ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting like sulfur, even though they
never applied it actually in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about spraying sulfur
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because I think there's still people
out there burning sulfur, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, in the United States,
there is no legal product for vaporizing
[SPEAKER_00]: or burning sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely illegal in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one product left registered in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume that's for safety reasons,
health concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume so, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody wants to register a vaporizing
sulfur product anymore in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no law saying it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no registrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the registered products, the companies
doing them dropped their labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't staying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't going to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've heard enough stories from like
the 60s and 70s of greenhouses burning
[SPEAKER_00]: down because of sulfur pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and looking back, I think I just
held my breath and went in and unplugged
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then closed the door again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking back now, I would wear a
respirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I did, I would wear a respirator
and be a lot more careful with my health
[SPEAKER_01]: now that I'm older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So word of caution to folks around sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep interrupting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and also once you use sulfur,
you can't go back to an oil for a period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depending on indoor, outdoor,
rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not, again, not debating whether
sulfur kills mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we know it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think there's so many other issues
around using it that I think in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: run, most facilities are better off with
an oil product for mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research is showing that these
oils can work just as well as sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also kill mildews and powdery mildew,
things like that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sulfur does powdery mildew,
but so does SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_00]: PM's on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does water, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, shout out to Olivia Carter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a student at Colorado State,
and I'm very interested in following her
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy talking with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has actually been looking at how hemp
russet mites reproduce differently on
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know I mean, obviously,
everybody knows that cultivars of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and hemp are very different, even though
it's a scene of genus specific epithet on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's actually looking at how hemp
russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looked at one was called unicorn
and elite was the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on elite in a week, hemp russet
mites could lay 20 eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unicorn only laid four eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a huge difference in the
reproductive capabilities, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which cultivar it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, these plants are grown
under the same conditions and a research
[SPEAKER_00]: control environment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also found that it took a lot longer
for hemp russet mites to mature on
[SPEAKER_00]: unicorns and actually did not live as long
on unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it did elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a hemp russet mite,
you're going to want to live on elite
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can have more babies,
your life cycles faster, you'll live
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's something different about
this unicorn cultivar of hemp that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't perform as well on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we see this where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in facilities and you have this
table of cannabis and it's crusty with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cultivar right next to it doesn't
have them on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, they're in different containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, yes, you could have
something different, but generally the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are treated the same in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is something to cultivars that
these mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone says to me, well,
how fast does hemp russet mite reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the cultivar of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one specific quick answer
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was nice to see that actually
being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's actually, there's a whole bunch
of work she's going to be working on where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually looking at the genome of
hemp russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be able to take a plant sample
and test it to see if they detect the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome of hemp russet mite in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's ever going to
become an affordable test method for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, but they are working out that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some real interesting stuff
coming down the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was so much stuff at this
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best meeting I have been to in a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much from these researchers
and it's really great because now it's my
[SPEAKER_00]: job to take what I've learned there and
take it to the growers, but also give
[SPEAKER_00]: credit to these researchers because they
deserve a lot of praise for the hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting and counting hemp russet mites on
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who wants that job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Counting how many eggs the hemp russet,
I mean, that takes dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you say the name of the show again for
folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a conference and it's invitation
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had told me that because I'd said I
wanted to go the next year.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing because it's for
researchers to network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, discuss their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's been some funding where
we're actually going to be making some
[SPEAKER_00]: educational videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the team that's working on like
hemp pests of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a funded project through a
grant for researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they invited me, which I felt very
honored to be invited to be part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was there other research at the show
highlights that you wanted to touch on
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those were the main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, we could go on forever,
but of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were a few things that I thought
were your people would find your people,
[SPEAKER_00]: your listeners would find very interesting
and trying to get that information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to recap, the main things were hop
latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroid is being found positive in roots
when leaves are testing negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually should be looking at roots,
which has a whole bunch of implications in
[SPEAKER_01]: media and other other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing a variety of viruses in hemp
and cannabis beyond, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that we've necessarily heard of even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to be spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see, what else do we talk
about here?
[SPEAKER_01]: The research you just mentioned around
from was it Olivia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, which one for the Olivia Carter?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing the like the genome on the
hemp recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might actually looking at their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that certain cultivars are more
susceptible to a particular pest than
[SPEAKER_01]: others, which we see in facilities all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to see that played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any other at least research
related stuff that I missed in sort of?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the highlights I brought
to you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took, you know, like a whole notebook
full of especially the disease stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I, you know, not so much a
disease person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the main disease people,
you know, again, Zamir up at Simon Fraser
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Jana Beckerman at Purdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two of the people like leading
the charge and for following people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you don't just you can't
just email these people with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with, you know, these guys
are researchers that are super busy
[SPEAKER_00]: working on stuff, but it's definitely
worth keeping an eye on them and read what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're publishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get a chance to hear them
speak, it's definitely worth worth doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can follow people on Google
Scholar and you'll receive alerts or email
[SPEAKER_01]: emails every time someone cites one of
their research papers or when they come
[SPEAKER_01]: out with a new paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I do with a few
researchers that I really like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm hoping I'm going to be speaking
in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think February, maybe January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: January, February, I'm going to be
speaking up in British Columbia and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to email Zamir because I'm hoping he
and I can catch up on some stuff together
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's just he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate all the work he's doing
and making the research very usable
[SPEAKER_00]: applied work for cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I feel bad for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers because their hands are tied
for working in cannabis and have these
[SPEAKER_00]: such narrow parameters they have to work
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that doesn't mean they're not
producing good research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with this research,
you know, it takes years to get the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to take a bit longer to
get a lot of this out out there.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, before we sign off,
I want to give a shout out to Catchmaster
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk a little bit about your poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that can get to see the
video here, I think we'll probably put up
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see the poster that
Suzanne framed in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on both of our Instagram pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken pictures of it just kind of
highlighting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully those will be made available
here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an I have an email in the
Catchmaster to find out how they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to distribute this poster out to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they make monitoring cards,
sticky yellow sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make blue cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a variety of products for pest
control, ranging from insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: rodents, live animal traps, a whole bunch
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make good they make good sticky
cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk a little bit about that
or a little about the poster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the idea of the poster was to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify what things that are stuck on
sticky cards look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time looking at sticky
cards and sometimes because insects fall
[SPEAKER_00]: in weird positions, it can be it can be
hard to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on this poster, we tried I tried to
break it down to good things, bad things
[SPEAKER_00]: and in different things, which is kind of
hard to do because they do have mites is
[SPEAKER_00]: bad because typically mites are generally
generally bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes, you know, there can be
beneficial mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically we don't find beneficial
mites on sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say you can't, but generally we
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where they have different color
rings or the green or good red is bad and
[SPEAKER_00]: then blue like with kalimbala springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're kind of indifferent and
it's not something you have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but they're not what I'd consider
beneficial as in beneficial in the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: eating capacity on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just a quick guide to some of
the basic things you find out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's yeah, it's a really cool
poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to getting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping I can get them in and then I
think I talked to Catchmaster about
[SPEAKER_01]: sending them out to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting soil through us,
for example, as a way to get them out to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we have more information about
how they're going to be distributed,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll definitely I'll let listeners know
because it is really cool to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the kinds of things that would
end up on your sticky card in a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actual photos of them versus, you know,
having to go online and guess and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and stuff can get mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one was made by Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that all of everything's
identified and photographed correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a nice resource for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I regret not putting on there
was a piece of peat moss because I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times I'm like, oh, is that a
thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Piece of peat moss because peat moss
fibers can look an awful lot like thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: on sticky cards and also perlite can look
like white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that happen a few times where you
just have to get in there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically what I do with my sticky
cards from growers is I bring them home
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and then I put them under my
microscope and just scan across them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't miss anything because you
really want to check them thoroughly for
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you I assume, though, with a dino
light or a good loop, you can pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: identify everything pretty effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if it's a thrips or an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just had a situation where in the
greenhouse, when I quick looked at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was soybean thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I got it back and looked at
it under a scope, I'm like, nope,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a soybean thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure it's a bean thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't with a lens out in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard to tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, again, why I kind of do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go over it with higher magnification
under my scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important, though, is that to a
grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, like for you, you want to
identify the particular species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can narrow it down to a family,
you know, if we can say we know it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips, do we really need can you give me
an example of why a real world example of
[SPEAKER_01]: why I would need to know the particular
species of thrips versus just knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a threat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not all thrips species pupate in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is a non soil pupating thrips,
nematodes are not going to help you in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pest management program like a kind
of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes do not help control a kind of
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also predatory mites really cannot
control in a kind of thrips population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a kind of thrips, you pretty
much have to spray for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, soaps, oils, microbials do
work, but mites and nematodes aren't where
[SPEAKER_00]: with like onion thrips, nematodes work
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing with soybean thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find soybean thrips regularly dotted
throughout cannabis facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still don't really know if they're
blowing in or if they're reproducing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they really don't cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this bean thrips is a caliothrips
species that I've seen become devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: to outdoor cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really on this part of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little concerning to find it in
a greenhouse over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is it came in genetics from the
West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now inside of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is it going to become
economically important in this facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on the East Coast where it's in an
indoor protected environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's important to know,
because if it's a soybean thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to do anything different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bean thrips, man, we got to watch that
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does make a difference on how much
damage the different thrips species can do
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis and also how you manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you could in the facility,
you could be saving a ton of labor or
[SPEAKER_01]: wasting your money just by not getting
proper identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your application rates may be off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're maybe using the wrong product.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you gave a very good example of why
we need to identify this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I go up to B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: in January, February, again, I'm going to
try to get my calendar updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to be doing a like a
thrips taxonomy ID talk there talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the main thrips and how you tell
them apart for where growers can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not making it over complicated,
but making it making it understandable
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for growers to be able to help make
decisions on management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can be like, I don't know,
I'm going to find a polite word for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, but being the queen of a jerk
about always wanting to know what species
[SPEAKER_00]: it is and how I think it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for some things,
Western flower thrips, onion thrips on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know, the the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make a difference in management on
those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily, but it's important to be
accurate on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though management the
same, you know, what does it matter if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't identify it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it matters because you need to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just part of my job is to
be accurate and not guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's too much guessing and bad
information going around on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a kitten on my lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Agatha, who is being very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know she's been I she jumped that five
foot cardboard box and got in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to see her on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's all my questions for
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we covered a lot and jumped around
a lot, but I thought that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's I kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you were in my pocket at that
meeting, Tad, because you would have found
[SPEAKER_00]: it really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what will Pester Zemeer and get him on
your show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, he can go into much greater
depth about his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no way I can begin to do
justice to his work because I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I like speaking more about my
experiences and my work, and I can go more
[SPEAKER_00]: in depth just repeating other people's
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's not always the best
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's best to get it direct
from the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll work on getting Zemeer and he can
talk a lot more on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we do need to cover viruses
and viroids and more depth because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more of a more of an issue in
cannabis.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate you having me again,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love doing this with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, well, you always seem to come
across new information and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pest management is just such a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that's always
evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we do need to do regular
shows on, you know, IPM related topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and now it's almost officially the
beginning of my candy making season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, thank you so much and enjoy the
rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we'll talk soon.
