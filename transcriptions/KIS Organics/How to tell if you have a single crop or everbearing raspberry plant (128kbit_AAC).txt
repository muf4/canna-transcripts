[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at your raspberry and you say,
I don't know, do I have a single crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: do I have everbearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is go to primocanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the primocanes are showing flower buds
or past fruit, then it's an everbearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the primocanes have no flowers or
fruit, then it's a single crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty easy to tell what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't mix them very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather just have one batch of the
everbearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I often will do, although I
didn't do it this year, I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time, I'll often take the everbearing and
prune them to the ground in the February,
[SPEAKER_00]: March completely and forego that summer
crop and just look forward to the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, the winter crop, the fall crop,
the September, October crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way of managing is you can
just take them to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly an easy way to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just cutting them off a ground
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up, they grow the primocanes,
they bloom, they bear fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year you just go and you
cut them to the ground.
