[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start the podcast, I wanted to
share some exciting news.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I'm thrilled to be
welcoming a baby girl into our farm
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are expecting in November and I will do
my best to keep up the podcast schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a lot going on, so please be
patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other news, I've been working with
Nathan Gibbs and Dr. Ben Higgins from Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf Gardens on a few different trials
ranging from mammoth pee to blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get the data back soon on
the blue mat versus hand watering trials
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been running in the facility and
will share it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben is also helping me with the blue mat
designs for beds and facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: so shoot me an email if you're interested
in trying out blue mats for your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this week's podcast, though,
I had the honor of interviewing Dr. Nadia
[SPEAKER_00]: Saba, also known as Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the president and founder of Dr.
Greenhouse, an agricultural and mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering firm that specializes in the
design of HVAC systems for indoor plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Saba has her PhD in agricultural
engineering from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona's Controlled Environment
Agricultural Center and is a licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical engineer in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: For over 20 years, she has dedicated her
education and career to helping farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: control their environments, allowing them
to grow crops indoors, in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in facilities that otherwise would be
impossible or impractical to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Nadia, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's start off by telling listeners
a little bit about your personal journey
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you ended up doing what you do now
for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have been studying and researching
and working in controlled environment
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture for about 21 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was an undergraduate at UC Davis,
I worked on a mushroom farm in southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Idaho, and this farmer was trying to grow
shiitake and oyster mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses and basically the Nevada
climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all summer, we could not keep the
greenhouses humid enough to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were constantly just wetting
down the floor and sticking hoses up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the HAF fans just to try to get moisture
into these greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while working up there, I lived in a
little 20 foot trailer right on the farm
[SPEAKER_02]: and just fell in love with farm life and
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that process of trying to control
these greenhouses to create a good
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for mushroom production,
I had my aha moment and decided that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to help growers to help farmers
control their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the summer of 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ever since I have been on the path to
do just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my master's degree at Penn State
studying air circulation in mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: production farms, which I consider the
first vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went on to get my PhD at the
University of Arizona in their controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment agriculture center,
where I studied evaporative cooling and
[SPEAKER_02]: ventilation and water use efficiency of
commercial tomato production in
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I got my PhD, I decided,
you know, I want to learn how to be an
[SPEAKER_02]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I left academia to the chagrin of
especially my mom, who did not understand
[SPEAKER_02]: why I would leave agriculture and leave
the prospects of being a professor and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching to go out and get a job in
mechanical engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a job, a real job as a mechanical
designer and learned how to be an HVAC
[SPEAKER_02]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that for about 10 years,
designing HVAC systems for commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings, high rise residential
buildings, even animal shelters became a
[SPEAKER_02]: big part of my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then indoor agriculture started to
take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanted to grow lettuce and plants
in vertical farms and plant factories and
[SPEAKER_02]: containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, cannabis was
becoming recreationally legal in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: and Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people wanted to grow plants
indoors, regardless of whether it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, vegetables or cannabis and
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my two worlds collided,
agriculture and mechanical engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided in 2017, I guess,
about two and a half years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: to start my own company, Dr. Greenhouse,
so that I could live my dream and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: design HVAC systems for indoor plant
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we specialize in is the
HVAC design for controlled environment
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, both greenhouses,
warehouses, vertical farms, plant
[SPEAKER_02]: factories, containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what you grow or what
type of building you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow it in, we can help you control
your environment better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have quite a dynamic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say the reason I reached out to
you is because I had multiple people,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Allison Justice, among others,
who said, this is the person in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that you need to talk to when it
comes to controlled environment
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've gotten a lot of accolades from
the people that I really respect in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm honored that you're on the show
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to start off sort of talking
about some of the goals of HVAC or
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment agriculture in
terms of looking at the main goals of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the environment, obviously,
air movement and odor control,
[SPEAKER_00]: as being the three that were sort of
highlighted in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as sort of the goals when
you step into a facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is kind of going through your head in
terms of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So HVAC specifically is an acronym for
heating, ventilation, and air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, it's about controlling the
climate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The air environment that's around people
as well as plants and other living
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for an indoor plant environment,
what we're really trying to do is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a two pronged design or set of
controlled parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the climate itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to control temperature and
humidity and the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to control the plant's
responses to the temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: in the space, which affects transpiration
rates, photosynthetic rates, metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: rates, of the plant, and so the general
health and growth of your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in addition to just temperature and
humidity, we're also trying to control the
[SPEAKER_02]: air quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quality includes things like
carbon dioxide and odor and VOCs,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the movement of the air around
the plant and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the particles basically, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that are actually inside the
air that's around your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so HVAC, we're controlling temperature
and humidity and that climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the air quality that's
surrounding your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that relates to the health and
productivity of the crops and of your
[SPEAKER_02]: final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how quickly that product grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's both yield as well as those
quality characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize it's a very complex topic,
which is why we have to hire experts like
[SPEAKER_00]: you to come in and assist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'm wondering is,
so what would be some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: just starting off with for a basic home
grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I had a four by four and eight
by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to set up a small little growth
row room inside of another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I was always taught was you want
to have a fan, let's just say a six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: inline ducting fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back in the day when we had single
ended air cooled hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would run negative pressure by
pulling the air out of the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: through a carbon filter in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you look to set up on the small
scale for the homegrown listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of tips and pointers might you
have along those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think that regardless of
what scale that you're growing out,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's small or it's medium or it's
commercial large scale, really the
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters are the same, but the scale is
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're setting up a smaller
grow, you don't have as many inputs from
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights, from the plants, from the
irrigation system, or even from the
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounding environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are, say, in a tent grower,
if you're in your garage, you have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: fewer variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have the same variables,
but you have less intensity of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have six plants for one high
pressure sodium lamp, it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: document the amount of heat that's going
to be generated by that lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a small wall area, so you don't
have to worry too much about what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your plants are getting a certain
amount of water that you are controlling
[SPEAKER_02]: very regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you probably know exactly how often
you're watering and how much your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can touch and feel the soil to
know when they need to be watered next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for those smaller facilities,
those small home grows, the HVAC equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can use to control the
environment can be relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be the air
conditioner, so it's just like a split
[SPEAKER_02]: system heat pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see this pretty commonly in home grows,
where you just have the condensing unit
[SPEAKER_02]: outside, and you have a fan cool unit
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just enough heat to, or it's just
enough cooling to remove the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: generated by the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's hot outside, so it can do
that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you might have one small
dehumidifier in the space to remove the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture that's being generated by the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a fan that's blowing air
around the plants to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're moving, make sure that you're
transferring the carbon dioxide to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, and also removing water from
transpiration heat away from the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe from the radiation from those lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of need like one of
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need one fan cool unit, one fan,
one light, one pump for irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: or your hand, one hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you scale up, it gets a little bit
more complicated because the dynamics get
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have a larger roof, say,
and bigger walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the interaction with the outside
environment might be a lot greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you have a lot of lights,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you went from 50 square feet
up to 500 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you have 10 times or maybe more
the number of lights than what you're used
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you have more plants, and you're
watering them probably more frequently or
[SPEAKER_02]: in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're using drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe even like a rock wall type of
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a more constant flow of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all of a sudden, maybe one of
everything isn't enough, at least if you
[SPEAKER_02]: use the same system that you were used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that I think becomes a real
challenge for growers who are scaling up
[SPEAKER_02]: is that they were used to a certain type
of system and used to a certain type of
[SPEAKER_02]: setup that works very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now as you get into these bigger
facilities, you need to multiply
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you stick with the same type of
system, say the same type of ATRAC system,
[SPEAKER_02]: now maybe we have 10 fans and 10 fan coil
units, 10 little air conditioners,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that becomes a real maintenance
challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that those fans that
you might've had sitting on your wall or a
[SPEAKER_02]: little floor stand fan, that can't reach
very far, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 50 square feet, it only has to
maybe reach 10 feet away, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 10 feet by five feet maybe if you're
in a 50 square foot little tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're in 500 square feet,
and now it's 10 by 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that fan can't blow 10 feet away or 50
feet away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you have to maybe think more
about how am I gonna get air to the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of the crop so that the plants in the
middle can dance as well as the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: close to the fans, close to the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with the air conditioning system
is, I've been on the phone with farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: who have these fan coil units,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are those systems that are
mounted on the wall and they just have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little fan in them and a little cooling
coil and they're circulating the air
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the space and sucking it out the
bottom and then blowing it out the side,
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler, drier air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now if you need, one of those in
your tent was great, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it at Home Depot, no problem,
pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now think if you have 10 of these
things in a space, all of a sudden it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes kind of a maintenance nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on the phone with a farmer one time
back East in Massachusetts and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, we inherited this facility and
all of our grow rooms are 500 square feet
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have like 10 or 12 of these fan
coil units on the wall in every single
[SPEAKER_02]: room and so we have like 180 of them total
in the facility and they break down all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly changing the fan motors or
the little coil pumps on them and they
[SPEAKER_02]: just become really challenging if you try
to scale up that same system that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: used to in the small grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are solutions where you could
still do one system per 500 square foot or
[SPEAKER_02]: even one system per 2000 square feet and
these are larger HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be packaged systems that sit on
the roof or outside of the facility and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an all-in-one and now what you can do
with that system is you can actually duct
[SPEAKER_02]: air from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you stick a duct on the end of that
and you can blow that air over the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the canopy and rather than relying so
heavily on fans, to move air around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can use ducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can either be hard metal ducts or
they can be fabric ducts and you can be
[SPEAKER_02]: strategic about blowing that conditioned
air down over your crop, wherever your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are and so that helps to solve some
of the issue with air distribution that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to experience with a larger
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say in general, while I'm on a
topic of air circulation, that is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest challenges and is very
important for plants because I had
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned earlier that it's responsible
for taking away the heat and the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: from the leaves and from the plant so that
they can continue to transpire and they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you think about it, they're also
going to deliver CO2 to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plants are generating oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need CO2 to photosynthesize and so
moving air across the plants is really
[SPEAKER_02]: important in an indoor facility and when
we get bigger rooms, it gets harder to
[SPEAKER_02]: move air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also a lot of farmers are now going
vertical, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to take more advantage of the
vertical space in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rather than having rooms that are 10 or
12 or 14 or 16 feet tall, now they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: take full advantage of their 20 foot or 25
foot tall warehouse and double stacking
[SPEAKER_02]: them and now when we talk about vertically
stacked plants, now we're not just having
[SPEAKER_02]: to deal with moving air horizontally,
now we have to move air vertically at
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple levels and that's a more special
challenge to figure out how do I create
[SPEAKER_02]: even air movement left and right as well
as from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the bigger challenges
associated with scaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting with a small facility,
it can be relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stepping up into sort of a medium sized
facility is challenging but maybe easier
[SPEAKER_02]: than even getting into say a 10,000 square
foot room or a 2,000 square foot room
[SPEAKER_02]: that's vertically stacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big challenge becomes moving air and
getting it out of the space before that
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity and that heat build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you talk about air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is such a fascinating topic
that I'm frankly pretty ignorant on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see an issue though like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have, you walk into a growing
space and you'll have fans blowing a
[SPEAKER_00]: varied amount of air and typically from
above down onto the crop or fairly close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the height of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know when I visit a lot of these,
you'll see leaf burn from the wind where
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can't transpire fast enough to
keep up with how quickly the air is moving
[SPEAKER_00]: across that leaf right near the fan but
then as you move further away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan, like you said, you're not getting
that air flow that you need for that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some ways that you fix this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned those ducting
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen those, the fabric ducts that you
can run down the aisles but with a more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional fan-based approach,
are there any tips and tricks in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: where you should be positioning your fans
or is there like a, I know we have flow
[SPEAKER_00]: meters for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ones for air that we can use to
measure or optimize our fan placement in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that we will do is
air or a fan design.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've actually found that using
traditional green house horizontal airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: fans work pretty well at mixing the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's kind of two aspects of air
movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is what I've been talking about about
moving air across the plants themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking up the boundary layer around the
leaves, because basically this pocket of
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture and heat sort of develop around
the leaf and we wanna break that up and
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitate gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing is just mixing and
getting a uniform environment around the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using horizontal airflow fans
creating sort of this circular pattern
[SPEAKER_02]: around the tops of the crop can really
help to mix the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you have the lights and you have
fans and you have motors and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's sitting above the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the crop down below
that's hopefully transpiring and is cooler
[SPEAKER_02]: and more humid and by having these fans
circulating above, it actually helps to
[SPEAKER_02]: break up the boundary layer between the
hot and the cold blocks of air that
[SPEAKER_02]: develop vertically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody knows that hot air rises
and that can be good when you have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of heat being generated from the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also water vapor is less dense than
air as is carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that humidity and that CO2
actually, or I mean, so the CO2 will kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of sink down to the ground and the
humidity will actually rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That water vapor will rise up with the
heat, which is a good thing in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using the HAF fans to mix things up
and they actually will act to sort of help
[SPEAKER_02]: to suck the moisture and the heat up from
the top of the canopy while also moving
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are really concerned
about having air movement down below and
[SPEAKER_02]: that underneath the canopy or at the lower
levels of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is important to move air to
circulate air lower in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're doing a good job of proving
and you don't have a lot of leaf material,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sort of in the lower half of
your crop, then you really don't need that
[SPEAKER_02]: much air movement down below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants grow from the top,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flowers are at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really air movement at the top of
the canopy is the most critical place to
[SPEAKER_02]: create that gas exchange, to create that
air movement because that's where all the
[SPEAKER_02]: activities happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the photosynthesis is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where, you know, the powdery mildew
is going to want to live on the flowers at
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having that air movement above the
crop and at the top of the crop is really
[SPEAKER_02]: more critical than having it from below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, air circulation is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I mentioned horizontal
airflow fans, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I mean, there's a sort of,
I mean, there's a science, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: there's sort of the art in HREC
engineering of air distribution design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't realize that the
diffusers, you know, if you look up in
[SPEAKER_02]: your ceiling at home or in the office or
whatever, and you look at the diffusers,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are hopefully selected specifically
for the environment that they are trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a certain throw
pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain way that air moves out
of the different diffusers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: available to us so that by the time the
air gets down to, say, your desk where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're sitting, it's mixed with the air
above and it's the perfect sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and velocity to not create a
draft or make you uncomfortable in your
[SPEAKER_02]: workspace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: With plants, we can actually be selective
with the types of diffusers and the
[SPEAKER_02]: location of those diffusers relative to
each other and relative to the tops of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to create the environment that we
want at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unfortunately, you know,
not a lot of engineers, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: take the time or really understand air
distribution design even for a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: building, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of the contractors
too who may be installing those ducts and
[SPEAKER_02]: those diffusers, you know, are probably
not thinking a lot about that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some science behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a method to the madness and
how those diffusers are selected and
[SPEAKER_02]: located that can create a more uniform
environment for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that, I'll be honest,
I've been pretty impressed with fabric
[SPEAKER_02]: ducts and, you know, there's a few
different manufacturers that create a good
[SPEAKER_02]: fabric duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I like about them is that if you
find the right company and the right
[SPEAKER_02]: representative of that company,
they will actually ask, well, what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: velocity of the air that you want at the
distance, you know, that your plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: from where the duct is going to be
installed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will literally engineer the holes
in those ducts, the holes in the nozzles
[SPEAKER_02]: and the perforations associated with that
duct sock or that fabric duct to create
[SPEAKER_02]: the velocity of air that you want at the
canopy level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been very impressed with the
companies that I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned DuckSock, that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say, look, I want one meter per
second at the top of my canopy and my duct
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be eight feet away from the
top of my canopy, can you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, actually, they probably can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, air distribution design does
not necessarily have to be a black box and
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't necessarily have to be
haphazard in a way that now we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw a whole bunch of fans into the room
to blow air around because the engineer or
[SPEAKER_02]: the contractor or the, you know,
duct supplier wasn't really asking the
[SPEAKER_02]: right questions or putting thought into
the design.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can design it pretty specifically to
create the environment that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I have a bunch of questions from that
last comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with these DuckSocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone who works with soils indoors
in a lot of these facilities, I just
[SPEAKER_00]: picture it being a dust and even like a
mite or pathogen magnet in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to where cleaning would be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about ducts in general and
their propensity potentially for being a
[SPEAKER_02]: harbor for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've heard both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some people say that metal
ducts can be a harbor for pathogens and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some people say fabric ducts
can be a harbor for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the answer is both.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with metal ducts, one concern is that,
you know, when they're metal, then water
[SPEAKER_02]: can condense on them and then you can have
dripping and then you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a free surface of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That pathogens love to live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, if your duct is dripping wet,
then you are not controlling humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature that's in your space
should be, if you're controlling humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: should be below the dew point or I'm
sorry, should be above the dew point
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of the air that's traveling
through your duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dew point is the temperature at which
condensation happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when dew is produced out of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you know, you have moisture
in the air and then you have a cold
[SPEAKER_02]: surface and that cold surface is at or
below dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that water condenses out of the air
and onto that surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that, you know, with ice,
you know, glass of ice water on a warm,
[SPEAKER_02]: humid day in Texas or anywhere except
basically California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's happening is that,
you know, with these, with these supply
[SPEAKER_02]: ducts, you have, you know, cold air coming
out of your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the facility, you have,
you know, warm, moist air that's being
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not able to control dew point
in your room very well, then yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: water can condense on that cold surface of
the duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're controlling humidity well,
then I would argue that would never
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to avoid that, if you don't want to
risk that at all, you can insulate that
[SPEAKER_02]: duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be very common in your
office building, in a commercial building,
[SPEAKER_02]: you insulate that duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, there's a couple of good
reasons to insulate your duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to prevent that risk of
condensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other is to make sure that the
temperature that's delivered to your room
[SPEAKER_02]: is the same from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about your you're
blowing, say 2000 CFM of air down a duct,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that air is going to travel 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if that duct is inside your
room, it's being bombarded with with
[SPEAKER_02]: light, it's being bombarded with maybe
that condensation could occur,
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the time it's traveled,
that air has traveled from the air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioner 100 feet to the other end of
the room, it could be two to five degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you insulate the duct, it's going
to be the same temperature from end to
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've eliminated that risk of
condensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the metal duct in terms of
pathogen risk and just condensation in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabric ducts, I mean, that's kind of the
same idea, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is is that fabric duct going to
collect water, which is inviting to
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would, you know, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good thing about, I mean,
you know, again, it goes back to the air
[SPEAKER_02]: that's traveling through your duct and the
air that's in the room that's then
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with the surface of that duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's sort of the same thing,
except that fabric is not as conductive to
[SPEAKER_02]: heat transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: As metal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So metal is very conductive to heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's going to it's going to maybe
have a higher propensity to condense
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: With fabric, it, you know, doesn't really
conduct heat that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same like if you took aluminum versus
wood, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, aluminum gets hot and cold very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where wood, it basically saves the same
temperature until you catch it on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fabric is sort of like you could think
of kind of like wood, like it's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: going to save the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think I do have the concern
about fabric ducts in the sense of what I
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the temperature gradient from
end to end is that it's a lot harder to
[SPEAKER_02]: insulate that fabric duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you don't want to insulate
the fabric duct because it's perforated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you insulate it, you're going to
block all those holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, you know, for a very long run,
a fabric duct, you could see a temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: gradient from end to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what some people really like about
fabric ducts is that they can wash them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can purchase them in
sections and they basically zip up and
[SPEAKER_02]: unzip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can take out sections and you can
throw them in the washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, do people actually do
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least the option is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you need an industrial size
washing machine as well to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and and think about, you know,
if you don't have extra pieces on hand and
[SPEAKER_02]: you may have some downtime unless you can
just replace it while you're washing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, those ducts or maybe you do want
downtime for a week or a few days just to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean out the room before the next crop
comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's there's pros and
cons to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, both can be good solutions and
don't have to harbor pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to get dirty and get a lot
of condensation if we're able to control
[SPEAKER_02]: the room the way we want to control the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if we go back to talking about,
you know, airflow in terms of measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, you mentioned that you could say to
a ducting company, I want one meter per
[SPEAKER_00]: second this distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on the canopy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get that one meter per second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's optimal for cannabis in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard ranges of like three to five
miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, that doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I have no idea what that would look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is there a tool that the growers can
use that's, you know, reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable to go into a room and check
different places like like, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do with a light meter, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, so half a meter to one meter
per second is equivalent to one hundred to
[SPEAKER_02]: two hundred feet per minute, which is
equivalent to one to two miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, so half a meter per second to one
meter per second is equivalent to one
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred to two hundred feet per minute,
which is equivalent to one to two miles
[SPEAKER_02]: per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, I mean, this is not necessarily
gospel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where this number comes from is from
vertical farming and plant factories,
[SPEAKER_02]: that what we have found is at least four
for leafy greens, for lettuce plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: basil plants, that as long as we're able
to grow the plant within that range of air
[SPEAKER_02]: velocity, that we eliminate leaf tip burn.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and get the highest rates of
photosynthesis and productivity and
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a quality characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so within that range, we know that
transpiration, we have good transpiration
[SPEAKER_02]: through the plant, which is why we're not
seeing leaf tip burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting a good amount of carbon
dioxide to the crop, which is allowing for
[SPEAKER_02]: good photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really based on lettuce crops,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those those lettuce crops,
you know, are dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about a head of
lettuce, those leaves are very close
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we're saying that,
you know, two miles per hour wind speed is
[SPEAKER_02]: good for this dense crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cannabis, honestly, I mean,
unless you have a dense crop and some
[SPEAKER_02]: people do, you know, see of green,
they don't prune a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really, you know, maybe vegetative
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want a lot of a lot of leaf
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't honestly, I don't see why it would
be a different number for for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf than it would be, say, for a lettuce
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure a lot of people may argue with
me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole idea is that we want to move air
across the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want stagnant air because our
plants won't transpire and they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesize as effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that number comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think because that's the only
documented research that it's the place to
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you can have an airspeed that's
too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's possible that the air
velocity could be too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant starts to close its stomata
to prevent too much water loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then if that happens, then we're
shutting down transpiration or slowing
[SPEAKER_02]: down transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that effectively reduces nutrient
transport, might increase nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies, slow down photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same on the other side is that if the
air velocity is too low, then that pocket
[SPEAKER_02]: of air, that pocket of moisture will just
build up around the stomata and around the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf so that it can't effectively exchange
water vapor away from the plant and CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just based on the documented research,
you know, we know that half a meter per
[SPEAKER_02]: second to one meter per second is a good
place to start, at least with
[SPEAKER_02]: horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until somebody does the research on
cannabis plants, I'm sticking to the
[SPEAKER_02]: research that I can find on horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, does that research account for the
addition of CO2 at fairly high levels into
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, which I assume would affect your
airflow and things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you know, I mentioned that air
movement is responsible for gas exchange
[SPEAKER_02]: period and gas exchange being,
you know, water vapor away from the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and CO2 to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, as long as your
environment is enriched and we have that
[SPEAKER_02]: good mixing from fans around the room and
all that CO2 hasn't sunk to the floor and
[SPEAKER_02]: confined its way up to the leaves and to
the top of the canopy, then you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that air movement is going to help deliver
that CO2 to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that if it's too high
that, you know, the CO2 is going to blow
[SPEAKER_02]: right by the leaf as long as, you know,
we have a good enriched environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly if the air velocity is too
low, then the CO2 might not make it to
[SPEAKER_02]: every plant evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you measuring this again?
[SPEAKER_00]: What tool are you using for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tool that we use to measure air
velocity is called an anemometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's vein anemometers and there's
hot wire anemometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vein anemometers tend to measure air speed
at a higher air velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 miles, 50 miles, no that's too high,
50 feet per minute and higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually closer to the 100 to 200 feet per
minute and higher is where they really is
[SPEAKER_02]: their sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vein anemometers sound like that,
you know, like they have the veins of a
[SPEAKER_02]: fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a little fan and you can
stick it in front of, in front of a fan
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll turn, right, like a little windmill.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hot wire anemometer is what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wire and it basically sends a
current based on the wind velocity it will
[SPEAKER_02]: change the current, the amperage current
to the meter and that gets converted into
[SPEAKER_02]: a reading of air velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hot wire anemometers, they work at
high velocities but they actually work
[SPEAKER_02]: really well at low velocities.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times at like 10 feet per minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can really, for these lower air
speeds that we're trying to get across the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, a hot wire anemometer is really
the tool that growers should use and
[SPEAKER_02]: engineers should use to sort of spot
measure what the air velocity is at the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of the canopy, in the middle,
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use them in the ducting, you can
stick them in the ducted system as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a long little tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of contractors use a hot wire
anemometer even to calibrate the fan speed
[SPEAKER_02]: from, from e-track equipment to make sure
that you're getting the right amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: air flow through the duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other question I had along this idea
of air exchanges, when I, I talked to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of growers, there's the sort of a
debate between sealed versus unsealed
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms with a lot more growers moving
towards sealed rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk, have you touch a
little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other thing I hear about is
when people are running unsealed rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: they talk about air exchange, like they're
exchanging the air in the room this many
[SPEAKER_00]: times per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is that air exchange from,
you know, to look at it from that
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything that you're talking
about right now is really sort of that
[SPEAKER_00]: movement around the room itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is it to get that air out of
the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, that's a, so let's first
talk about the difference between air
[SPEAKER_02]: velocity and air volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So air velocity is that, that speed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The wind speed, say, across your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just said, you know, 100 to 200 feet
per minute in that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air volume is spoken of in CFM or cubic
feet per minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the total volume of air that
gets delivered, say, from your HVAC system
[SPEAKER_02]: through your duct and into your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't become air velocity until,
you know, we actually measure the speed of
[SPEAKER_02]: that air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure that everybody
understands that distinction because
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I hear people use CFM and,
or CFM interchangeably with velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The velocity is feet per minute and volume
is CFM.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to make that distinction
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, sealed versus unsealed
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I understand why people want sealed
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's generally, I would say,
three reasons to have a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: recirculating air conditioning system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that I hear are, one,
we want to prevent any contaminants from
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into the facility through the air
handling system, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The second reason is for odor control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we're going to talk on odor
control a little bit later, but we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep odors out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we ventilate, if we bring air in,
then that means we also have to take air
[SPEAKER_02]: out and that odor has, or that air has
odors, which is offensive to our neighbors
[SPEAKER_02]: and to, you know, the building department
who's going to give us our permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third reason is carbon dioxide,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that if we're enriching this
environment with CO2, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: just dump it out through the ventilation
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're spending money on that
CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we want to keep it contained.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the unsealed rooms, though,
the rooms that have some ventilation air,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, check a few boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually like to design facilities
that have at least the option for
[SPEAKER_02]: ventilation air and are not 100%
recirculating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a few reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that building permit is that,
you know, the building code, the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial and residential building codes,
and right now we're sort of in this weird
[SPEAKER_02]: gray area where all the building
departments are trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_02]: to regulate these buildings and whether it
should meet the same standards of higher
[SPEAKER_02]: standards or lower standards, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the commercial building code has a
requirement that you have to provide a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount of ventilation air for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know there's all sorts of studies
that show that at elevated carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_02]: levels, people are less productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think, don't think as well when CO2
levels are just as high as 600 or 800
[SPEAKER_02]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the building codes have
a requirement to provide at least some
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh outside air to keep CO2 levels down
at least below a thousand parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have a healthy environment to
work in and are more productive.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by having some ventilation air to
meet just minimum building code
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements, check that box.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that means that a building
inspector isn't gonna come back through
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, hey, why aren't you meeting our
ventilation code requirements?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not giving you a permit until you
change that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a huge disruption to your
construction schedule and your operation
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rather than guessing or hoping that
they're not going to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement, I'd rather just build it in
because usually it's a very small amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, it would be equivalent to
0.15 CFM per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for a 10,000 square foot room,
that's like 1500 CFM out of a total of
[SPEAKER_02]: 150,000 CFM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2000 CFM versus 150,000 CFM.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like nothing, but it checks
the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the code official.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing is that what if your CO2
enrichment system goes down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to feed your plants if
you run out of liquid CO2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if now, you know, in the future,
the building inspector decides you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: use CO2 burners in your facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get CO2 into your room?
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with a vertical farming client a
couple years ago, and they were trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out why their plants wouldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I'm like, I'm on the
phone with them for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's the temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're looking at the data,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The historical data.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature is right on target.
[SPEAKER_02]: The relative humidity is right on target.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're irrigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights are working how they thought
they should be working.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're going through all these
different variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I just asked this question,
like, you guys are enriching with CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just silence on the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a completely sealed
environment and were not ventilating or
[SPEAKER_02]: enriching with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went up, they pulled up the data
and the CO2 level in their vertical farm
[SPEAKER_02]: was 200 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their plants didn't have any food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say I want a sealed
environment because I want to keep CO2 in,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always ask the question, well,
what happens when you don't have any CO2?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some ventilation air,
it doesn't take that much to bring CO2 in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're ventilating air because we're
trying to kick CO2 out for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also bringing CO2 in that your
plants are using for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, again, at least building it into
your system, even as an option,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you close the dampers,
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's close them and keep it sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have the option to open them up
to let ventilation air in, you may be
[SPEAKER_02]: really happy one day that you gave
yourself that option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third thing is, in some climate
zones, having the availability of outside
[SPEAKER_02]: air to condition your space could be an
energy savings measure for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in a location where it can be
cool and dry, Colorado, perfect example,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be cool and dry during a lot of the
year, you can actually bring that outside
[SPEAKER_02]: air in to air condition and dehumidify
your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all you're doing is running a fan
as opposed to a bunch of air conditioning
[SPEAKER_02]: compressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could actually reduce your energy
use by 80% in any given hour because the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing you're running are fans and not
compressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't work for every climate
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're in Hawaii or if you're
in Texas, there's probably not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: time where that's available to you to use
outside air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that wouldn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, using or at least having the
option for outside air I think is a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of contamination and bringing
in pathogens and pests into the building,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's not as much in the air as
people think there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm of the school of thought that people
transfer pests and pathogens, not the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who have those home grows,
that six plant, one light, tend to grow at
[SPEAKER_02]: home and then come into the 5,000 square
foot grow facility and don't put on
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves, don't change out of their street
clothes, and just start touching plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where powdery mildew comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming from your air conditioning
system that has filters on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I'm talking about filters,
while I'm on the topic, I do want to say
[SPEAKER_02]: that all you really need in terms of
filters to keep mold spores out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility is a MERV 13 filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not need HEPA filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEPA filters are great if you're concerned
about viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're concerned about botrytis and
powdery mildew, then all you need is a
[SPEAKER_02]: MERV 13 filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say that you should also
install a MERV 8 filter before your MERV
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 filter so that it can catch all the
dust particles and let your MERV 13 filter
[SPEAKER_02]: just catch all the spore particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make that plug on filters
because HEPAs are just overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wonder though, what about pesticide
drift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's another reason to avoid air
exchange potentially as well if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: in agricultural area and you're worried
about what the farmer next door is
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide drift, honestly, it's so
interesting to me in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard concerns about pesticide
drift in mushroom production or in
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial tomato production or pepper
production or lettuce production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide drift is not something that
people are thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm guessing the reason pesticide
drift is so important for cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_02]: is because if you get a lab test that says
that you have pesticide residue on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but if you're a tomato grower,
that's not an issue for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I find that pesticide drift
challenge really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, especially with greenhouses,
if you're trying to use conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: ventilation or pad and fan systems and you
are close to a farm or in an agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: area where your neighbors might be using
pesticides or other sort of chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers either, then I would say that
is definitely a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a couple things about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is you could get to know your
neighbors and make friends with them and
[SPEAKER_02]: find out when they're going to spray,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are rules and regulations about
when you're allowed to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to spray during
inversion layers because it just keeps it
[SPEAKER_02]: all down and it can't get out of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Down near the human occupied zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also, I'm pretty sure most farmers
don't want to spray on windy days because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to lose a lot of the
chemicals to their neighbors or it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get on their crop like they want
it to, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in getting to know your neighbors who
might be field farmers and might be
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying fertilizers and pesticides on
their crop is if you know, if you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: good relationship with them and you know
when they're going to spray, you could
[SPEAKER_02]: take that into account in terms of your
operation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that if they're not spraying today and
it's a beautiful, cool, dry day,
[SPEAKER_02]: then open up your air conditioner right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let outside air come in all you want,
all you can to reduce energy and
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement with CO2 and save on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, tomorrow and then you
have a phone call with your neighbor and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like, hey, I'm going to spray
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the perfect conditions to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say, hey, you know, thanks Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, thanks for letting me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that day you can close it up and
do 100% recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I totally get the concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there are sort of ways to work
within, you know, the agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations as well as, you know,
just having a good relationship with the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors around you that might be doing
spray application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm hopeful though that
this industry, the cannabis industry can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be a catalyst for some change
within our greater agricultural industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at some of these rules and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just two weeks ago, this is a little
bit of a tangent, but I had a lady contact
[SPEAKER_00]: me about heavy metal levels and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called the Washington State
Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I was told that as long as
you're a soil amendment, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for heavy metals, you know,
and compost is just sold as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily for gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I called the Oregon Department of
Ag and they told me that if you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: it into a bag, then they do have some
requirements and testing around that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had set the level at,
247 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was somewhere right around there for
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lead was the one we were concerned
about with this particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what I was told is that that
level was set by someone that was
[SPEAKER_00]: contracted by the, I guess it was the FDA
originally as an outside consulting group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, can you send me the
research as to why they came up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific number that was allowed in
crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I would assume if you're growing
cannabis or a root crop, it would have
[SPEAKER_00]: higher levels of heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't gotten that research yet,
but it just, it made me realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I am a little too trusting about
things and assume that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the government's looking out for me on
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, that may not be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think pesticide drift kind of falls
into that category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally agree with you in that I
think that the cannabis industry is a
[SPEAKER_02]: catalyst for change and for technology
development and regulation development in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we'll all be for the public
good and for the building up and evolution
[SPEAKER_02]: of agriculture in general, because
agriculture is moving indoors or some of
[SPEAKER_02]: it is and will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we're not growing wheat indoors,
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're growing vitamin rich crops
indoors, then the things that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: learning from track and trace and from
organic certification and from pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: use, I think a lot of that is going to
transfer over from cannabis to indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture in general, as well as
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, there's so much of us in
the industry who are so grateful for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because we're getting rapid R&D
on things like lighting and irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: systems and HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, these equipment and systems
that can be more focused on growing plants
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors, AKA horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's good for cannabis is good for
the rest of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even a training ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for for future farmers is that,
you know, a lot of young people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, are growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've talked to so many of
them who have either moved into more
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional horticulture and are growing
tomatoes and lettuce or who want to
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those of us in in indoor
agriculture, controlled environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture in general, see a lot of
crossover and see a lot of benefits coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis for for agriculture and
horticulture at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that it's a gateway drug now for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drugs for farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question I had when you were
getting back to the sealed versus unsealed
[SPEAKER_00]: room concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were talking about that,
we're kind of talking about one entity,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what in my head I'm picturing is,
let's say, a 10000 square foot building
[SPEAKER_00]: that then has, you know, maybe six 1000
square foot sealed rooms inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have air exchange outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I was just in a facility,
you know, a metal a metal warehouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma, for example, where you have
temperature extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one hundred and two degree
temperatures outside at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you might be below freezing at other
points during the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just while I was there,
there was, I think, a 20 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swing to where I would I would
think we'd want to have at least where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're growing the plants more of a sealed
room and then maybe air exchange into a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger area where the temperature isn't
quite as controlled, where, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of the processing and
packaging and admin stuff is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are your thoughts around that
sort of a setup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, you know, so many facilities
are being built as sort of rooms within a
[SPEAKER_02]: room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where or rooms within a building where you
have insulated panel walls of some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: that are built into a warehouse,
which, you know, the the warehouse
[SPEAKER_02]: exterior walls and roof are having the
direct interaction with the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have, you know, these
insulated rooms that are interacting more
[SPEAKER_02]: with the inside of the warehouse,
which may or may not be controlled,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's probably tempered at least from
what's happening outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those sealed rooms are
great in terms of heat transfer and
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that we're not going to have a lot
of heat leaving the walls and the roof or
[SPEAKER_02]: even water vapor transferring through,
which can make humidity control really
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging because of those insulated
panel walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good thing, because the more
that we can control the gains and losses
[SPEAKER_02]: across the envelope, the more predictable
it's going to be what the loads are at any
[SPEAKER_02]: given time from the plants and lights and
the fans and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in terms of, you know, now the
warehouse building itself, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't necessarily have to have these
insulated walls, these rooms built into a
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse using those that panel system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do more sort of traditional
construction and we can build out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, partitioning walls within the
warehouse and have them insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend using rigid insulation
and metal stud walls as opposed to wood
[SPEAKER_02]: and bat insulation, which will have a
greater propensity to grow mold and get
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in terms of interaction with the
rest of the facility, so if you say have
[SPEAKER_02]: six grow rooms and then you have a common
corridor and then you have all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, post-harvest packaging and
drying and office areas, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that I like to design a facility
like that is to make those grow rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly positively pressurized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this becomes a force, good reason for
bringing in outside air is that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: positively pressurize these rooms so that
we can keep contaminants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, you know, if you imagine just say
four rooms, you know, two across from each
[SPEAKER_02]: other, split by a common corridor,
and if those two grow rooms have slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: more air that's blown into them than
what's in say that common corridor,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that air is going to want to push out
of those rooms and say, under the cracks
[SPEAKER_02]: of the doors, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The door jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time you open the door to go
into the facility, air will push out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by creating that positive pressure,
you know, pathogens and bugs, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they like to follow the path of least
resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of go with the flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you open a door and air is
pushing back on them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not gonna push against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not gonna, you know, go into that
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're stuck on you, say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, positively pressurizing
that room and then having a corridor
[SPEAKER_02]: that's maybe slightly negatively
pressurized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a little bit more suckage in
the corridor so that then it's pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: that air out of the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can run that air through a
carbon filter before, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it leaves, it leaves the building or as
it's leaving the building so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent the odors from leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I don't know if that answers
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's sort of what I was thinking
is positive pressure in the rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: negative pressure in the larger building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're not trying to odor control
each room because you don't care if the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want to, you know,
tick off your neighbors or get a complaint
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like smaller rooms because you can't
you can't adjust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each room is slightly
adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to separate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of keep, you know, different
issues in different rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have thrips in room one,
you don't necessarily have to have thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: in your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room two could still be clean or room
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition that, you know,
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I typically like smaller
rooms too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they don't have to be super small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 500 square feet, you know,
is kind of the lower end of the size of a
[SPEAKER_02]: room that I might like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think 10,000 square feet is too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 5,000 square feet is probably too
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000
square feet feels to me like the right
[SPEAKER_02]: size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you mentioned containment
for pathogens, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that if you get a room that gets
infected or contaminated with thrips or
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew, then it's contained to a
small room and, you know, or to a small
[SPEAKER_02]: yield and crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you can just take that crop
and run it through extraction and call it
[SPEAKER_02]: a day, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe you don't completely lose
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing too is that I think
something that's totally overlooked or too
[SPEAKER_02]: often overlooked is when you have a really
big room, that usually means that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different cultivars or strains in
that room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about, you have 1,000
square foot room, and maybe it has two
[SPEAKER_02]: different cultivars in that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now if you have a 10,000 square foot
room, does that mean you have 20 different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in that room?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you control the temperature and
the humidity and the lighting levels and
[SPEAKER_02]: the irrigation even and the nutrient mix
for all those different strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, you have indica and you
have sativa and you have hybrids and you
[SPEAKER_02]: have you have an indica that grows like a
sativa or you have a sativa that grows
[SPEAKER_02]: like an indica, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how are you supposed to control all
those variables for the very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: breed of plants that you have when you
have a lot of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have a smaller room and
maybe you can actually schedule the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation of two strains that
physiologically like the same environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the same levels of light,
like the same temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the same nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you can really dial in the
conditions specifically for that one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two or maybe three strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: How beautiful would that be if we could
actually optimize the environment for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to what most growers do is
they're like, okay, we have six strains in
[SPEAKER_02]: here and we do that because the market
likes these six strains or because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: testing a new strain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're constantly hitting the
accelerator and pushing the brake at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't, by trying to make
everybody happy, you make nobody happy,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is so true for these plants
is that you end up picking a temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and humidity and a lighting level that
isn't really optimized for any of those
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just optimal for keeping them happy,
but not joyful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could use that analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I think having smaller rooms and
focusing your environment on just one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two really similar physiological strains,
I think growers would be really surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: by how well their plants would do,
how well they would respond to the perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: level of PPFD and the perfect vapor
pressure deficit that they were bred quite
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly to thrive in, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you didn't call on me for a
discussion on breeding, but if you think
[SPEAKER_02]: about where so many of these crops have
come from, they were bred for very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific environments for their specific
grower and their specific conditions and
[SPEAKER_02]: their specific equipment and their
specific climate outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we try to shove them into our box
and they don't respond the same because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the same parameters or the same
control or an understanding of what those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants were specifically bred to thrive
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think there's a lot that can go into
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more people are getting into it,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it when I talk to people who are
growing in greenhouses and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we are actively working on breeding
plants to grow in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, as opposed to trying to take
an indoor strain and ask it to grow well
[SPEAKER_02]: in a greenhouse, which is completely
different than an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ton of genetic diversity right
now in cannabis with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you bring up some really good
points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add that by going with these
smaller rooms, we can control workflows
[SPEAKER_00]: better too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can harvest, say, each room every
10 to 14 days or whatever schedule makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we don't have plants of different
ages going into a giant room where we will
[SPEAKER_00]: never get control of a pest or pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have the ability to really
clean the room if you're going with the
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual harvest, which is why I don't
like these big rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does sound like from a HVAC
perspective, there are challenges when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to be a certain size in terms of
having a homogenous environment like you
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we didn't even get into VPD or
greenhouse environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who has a greenhouse,
I did have some questions for you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could do a follow up interview
with you and discuss some of those topics
[SPEAKER_00]: and also get some questions from
listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, greenhouses can be a completely
different topic instead of parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, ultimately, we're controlling the
environment, of course, but once the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: comes into play, it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely worth its own
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have a lot of challenges growing
tomatoes and cucumbers and peppers in our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and in terms of regulating
temperature and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I look forward to chatting about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to make this particular
podcast too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if that's possible, I will reach out
here again soon and be in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Nadia Saba, also known as Dr.
Greenhouse.
