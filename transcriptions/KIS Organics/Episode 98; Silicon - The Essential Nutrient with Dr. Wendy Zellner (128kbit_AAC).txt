[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Wendy Zellner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Zellner received her doctorate from
the University of Toledo in 2012,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she trained in molecular and
cellular biology, focusing on the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon in plant defense responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon graduation, she pursued a four-year
postdoctoral position with the USDA ARS
[SPEAKER_00]: where she continued studying the role of
silicon in alleviating both abiotic and
[SPEAKER_00]: biotic stress in tomato and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her current studies are designed standard
methods for quantifying the uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon from fertilizer material in
addition to identifying uptake mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: for silicon in model species and testing
for similar pathways in other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a ton from Wendy in this
podcast, and it got me excited to do more
[SPEAKER_00]: plant trials utilizing silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conjunction with the release of this
podcast, we are offering discounts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: two main silica products that we carry at
Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Egg Cil 16H and will last a night for a
limited time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Wendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a topic that I've been wanting to
cover for a very long time, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: shockingly difficult to find a true
resource and expert on silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little about yourself and
we'll start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I am from Northwest Ohio,
born and raised in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't come from an agriculture
background, but always had a love for
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition and disease and really started
to get into plant nutrition in high school
[SPEAKER_01]: and then in college really got into the
cellular molecular aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was fortunate enough after
graduation to get a position with USDA ARS
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was able to study the role of
silicon and disease in a much broader
[SPEAKER_01]: sense where I was exposed to the
horticulture and floriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really, as we've been exploring
this, seeing how important silicon is as a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant nutrient, especially with how it
pertains to plant health really pushed me
[SPEAKER_01]: to pursue it even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been really active with
different regulatory bodies and different
[SPEAKER_01]: groups to really get the correct education
of silicon out there and what it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to use it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've done a number of podcasts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of resources that people
Google your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this podcast, I want to lay a little
bit of a foundation before we dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: the real meat of the topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you start off telling us just a
little bit about what is silicon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silicon as an element, we refer to it
as silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the second most abundant element
that's in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is the amount that we need for
plant uptake is a very, very low fraction
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, as we we've been growing
plants in soil or as we have them in
[SPEAKER_01]: soilless media and hydroponic system,
the amount of the plant available silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: that's there is actually really,
really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like any other nutrient,
it has specific uses by different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we've really been trying to
understand why plants take up the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of silicon that they have and what they're
actually using the element for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a couple of different terms
for silicon that are kind of thrown out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about silicon,
we're talking about the element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the silicates, which is
usually when it's associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like calcium or potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solicic acid is the plant available form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have other forms of silicon
like silicone, which is used in other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's really interesting about
this element is we use it in our everyday
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it for things like electronics,
for abrasives and toothpaste, for
[SPEAKER_01]: cosmetics, additives, even for our own
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: People take silicon supplements for their
hair, the nails, cartilage, reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: wrinkles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this nutrient we have been taking
advantage of both in our physical life and
[SPEAKER_01]: our health life, and the plants do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all evolved to use this highly
abundant element in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really everything that we're trying
to educate on silicon, all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge has been present in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've known about a lot of this for
centuries, and we're just trying to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: together in an easier way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we start talking about silicon,
in the terms of nutrients, it really takes
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of that weird anomaly that people use
to try and describe what silicon is and
[SPEAKER_01]: puts it into a much easier, understandable
realm of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned silicate is the form when
we talk about something like potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate or silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breaks down to salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's what's actually available
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, with the silicates, so it's a
cation, the calcium, potassium or sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the silicon and oxygen from
interacting with one another because
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon loves to interact with itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they didn't have these other
elements present, then it would form an
[SPEAKER_01]: amorphous, almost like a gel and not
always a gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But an amorphous group of silicon
compounds that the plant can't absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it only absorbs those single units of
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by having potassium, calcium,
or sodium in that formulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it helps keep more of them in smaller
units that the plant can then take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like any of our other nutrients,
nitrate, phosphate, they all have
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the plants are able to absorb through
different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know salicylic acid is that form
that's the one that we're looking for to
[SPEAKER_01]: be transported by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that amorphous forms are
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we jump ahead, actually, here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to come back to the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we talk about some of these forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think of potassium silicate,
starting there, that's probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dynagrouprotect, eggsil-16H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe we can go to calcium
silicate, silica sand, diatomaceous earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: these sources that pop into my head as a
grower of silica.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, the word amorphous versus
crystalline.
[SPEAKER_01]: When silicon's in an amorphous form,
it's going to be more easily broken down
[SPEAKER_01]: into salicylic acid than a crystalline
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can think of crystal like a diamond,
is highly crystallized carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we think of the crystallized
form of silicon, that is what quartz is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very strong crystalline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a long time for us to
get those salicylic acid units to break
[SPEAKER_01]: apart from that structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the amorphous structure, it's a much
more relaxed structure, usually with a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have more of that silicon that can
come off as salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, not all amorphous
forms of silicon have the same release
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets a little bit tricky there when
we think of crystalline versus amorphous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we get to the potassium
silicates, even though when I think of
[SPEAKER_01]: amorphous silicon, I think of a group like
what's present in the grasses or the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytolith or the opals or the biogenic
silicon that's deposited within a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's a larger amount of silicon
deposited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not what is present in these
potassium silicates, whether they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution or in a dry powdered form.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, the silicon is in much smaller
subunits, and a lot of it is kept within
[SPEAKER_01]: that single salicylic acid unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the release rate from a potassium
silicate is going to be a lot higher than,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, a release rate from rice hulls,
which have a biogenic amorphous form of
[SPEAKER_01]: the silicon that's present there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can think of these potassium and
calcium and sodium silicates as having a
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylic acid fraction, which is a
certain percent of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then small amounts are either one or
two silicon grouped together in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: dimer or small polymers that can be
released into that salicylic acid for
[SPEAKER_01]: plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually stated that incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amorphous is the more available form
for those listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I was worried about when I
first started using potassium silicate
[SPEAKER_00]: was, I believe the term is silicosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How dangerous is it to breathe these sorts
of things as you're utilizing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a grower perspective, how careful do
we need to be with PPE and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with silicosis, that usually is due to
the particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: The particle size is the biggest thing
that you need to look into with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, for something to be
small enough to be inhaled deep enough
[SPEAKER_01]: into our lungs, we're looking at a
particle size less than five, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: five, I want to say nanometers or microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be five microns, but it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have a very, very small
particle size, and the other thing is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: crystalline silica that does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because within the lungs,
the macrophages try to engulf it and get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not able to, and then it causes
scarring and release of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole disease process that's
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when we look at the silicon
materials that are on the market as a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer and specifically looking at the
dry material, that have a higher incidence
[SPEAKER_01]: of dust and inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These particle sizes are much,
much higher than the crystalline size that
[SPEAKER_01]: is associated with asbestos and other
small silicon compounds that would cause
[SPEAKER_01]: silicosis or mesophilioma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the products that are out
there as a fertilizer, they pass safety
[SPEAKER_01]: tests because they are a larger particle
size and they won't be inhaled deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: the lung to cause that type of reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me feel a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to be careful when mixing
these.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's with anything that's
going to form a dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter whether it's clay,
whether, you know, all products that form
[SPEAKER_01]: a dust, they do suggest wearing a mask and
reducing that inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the form of the psiliosis,
it's really dependent on the particle size
[SPEAKER_01]: and the crystalline form of the silicon
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of the silicates,
is one better than the other if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing potassium, calcium or sodium in
terms of salicylic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of a silicon fertilizer,
if you apply any of those at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylic acid concentration, you're going
to get the same silicon response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen any tests yet that would
show that one formulation is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: outperform another based on whether it's a
calcium, sodium or potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to think about though is for
instance, with the calcium silicates,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can release calcium oxide and it
might have an effect on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you might need or you might not
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the sodium silicates, if you're
worried about raising sodium levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's always a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the concentration of the
salicylic acid that we're putting into
[SPEAKER_01]: these systems, the amount of sodium that's
coming along with it is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though there's that potential
there, you can kind of, you need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: aware at what concentration the sodium is
really going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not really adding that sodium
stress that some people shy away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium silicates from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me of the idea of with table
salt versus Himalayan salt, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: trace minerals in there is so minimal that
really probably aren't getting as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a health benefit as people claim versus
using straight calcium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about concentrations,
I guess is the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, I went to a trade show quite
a few years ago and there was a company
[SPEAKER_00]: selling silica sand and they claimed this
was a great source of silica for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first question to them,
and I'm fairly ignorant on silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: was when does this become available to my
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't really have an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said there's a lot of variables
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you think about a product like
that in a cultivation scenario when we
[SPEAKER_00]: would want the silica acid within a
cultivation period of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what it comes down to
is, is it a soil additive or soil
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment or is it a silicon fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think of a silicon fertilizer,
that means it's going to release enough
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylic acid through that single growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if it provides more the
next or the third growing season,
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an added benefit versus a soil
amendment, which is something that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in to help rebuild the silicon
pools within the soil, which really is not
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you would do if you're in
the soilless media or more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horticulture type of production
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at things like these sand
additives, the tests that I've run on the
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we have that are more of the
crystal and sand have not shown any
[SPEAKER_01]: release rate of salicylic acid that would
provide enough silicon for any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that we use during a growing
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if we were to work that into,
say, a soil system where you have microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that can actually weather crystal and form
the silica that would be present in sand
[SPEAKER_01]: material or more highly structured
amorphous material, that may work as an
[SPEAKER_01]: additive and you might see benefits from
that over years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I've done, we haven't really
seen much of a benefit using those types
[SPEAKER_01]: of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I would ask those companies
is to show information where they grew
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with and without and they saw an
increase in foliar silicon with that
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an indication that the
material would provide silicon to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that seems like a reasonable
standard for a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times you'll just see
side by side photos, but there can be so
[SPEAKER_00]: many other variables associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could improve water drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could improve so many other physical
barriers that the response they're showing
[SPEAKER_01]: you in those photos is not a silicon
response, but showing that they see a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in silicon concentration and
the foliar tissue that suggests that it
[SPEAKER_01]: does release silicon and you may have some
of the benefits that are mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a kind of a similar product would be
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't, again, I've just done
extraction studies with diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does come in lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say extraction studies,
similar to how they determine what the
[SPEAKER_01]: water soluble nutrients are, we have right
now an extraction that we use to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's plant available silicon in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we call it just shorthanded the
five day method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'll be referring to as.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this five day method in
diatomaceous earth, we do see that it
[SPEAKER_01]: provides, um, at least 0.2% silicon,
which is 2000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what our application that we
suggest is anywhere from 60, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 to 60 parts per million in a soilless
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with it coming in at 2000,
it does have a potential to be a silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: source for, uh, both the horticulture,
um, and soilless type medias or for soil
[SPEAKER_01]: as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it probably has a better
advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have the correct microbes in
your soilless mix that could help release
[SPEAKER_01]: even more of the silicon that's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all the silicon that's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the diatomaceous earth is going to
be released in some situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you could encourage that release
depending on what's present within your
[SPEAKER_01]: growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DE does have some potential then you
think in, in soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what I do think it does, it warrants,
it definitely warrants more studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a very affordable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what, so do you know what percentage
of cellosilic acid, um, we, we could
[SPEAKER_00]: expect or how would it compare to like a,
a silicate application?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's going to be much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with some of the calcium silicate
products that we use, it releases about a
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you get into things like
molassinite, that's up to with the five
[SPEAKER_01]: day extraction anywhere from four to 6%
silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's at a much lower range and you
would have to add more of the product into
[SPEAKER_01]: the mix to get to those silicon levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then again, depending on what it
is you're growing, that's going to dictate
[SPEAKER_01]: how much silicon you actually need
additionally in that growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for some, um, fruits or vegetables,
the diatomaceous earth might be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas for your, um, plants that
accumulate silicon to the levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, potassium or nitrogen,
you might need to bump it up with other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources or, um, use a combination of
sources for those higher, um, feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this case, um, the podcast is
focused more for cannabis or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how would, I mean, I know cannabis
hyper accumulates, it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how, have you seen any research in
relation to silica?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there have been some, and this
actually came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did get some information from,
uh, Dave, who was part of the Dynagro
[SPEAKER_01]: group and they did tissue analysis for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it comes in about 2% SI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's up there above the calcium,
um, at potassium and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much silicon those plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we get into stuff like
cannabis, but then even there's
[SPEAKER_01]: floriculture plants, verbena, which takes
up 2% and Lantana.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants take up such a high amount
that you need to make sure it's present
[SPEAKER_01]: within the media at, um, a high release
rate because they continually take it up
[SPEAKER_01]: well while they're growing, um,
and while they're maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlike other plants that take up
certain amounts only during certain times
[SPEAKER_01]: of their maturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants that hyper accumulate silicon
tend to take it up continuously throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they need a continuous supply of
it, um, in order for them to benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and have the best health and the best
production that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize we haven't talked about the
benefits yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I still want to hold on that one
because I had a couple more questions now
[SPEAKER_00]: that we dove into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so in, in regards to um, you mentioned
with application rates, how important it
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's a consistent application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we need to worry about toxicities
or accesses with silicon in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a, essentially a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with it, it is a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and hopefully we'll get it to that
status here soon in the U S but all that
[SPEAKER_01]: aside, one of the most amazing things
about silicon compared to all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: elements is I believe it is one of the
most regulated and the most well regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that are present plants only
take up and absorb the amount of silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can deal with that at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is unlike nitrogen and
phosphate copper and all of our other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, we do not see phyto toxicity
symptoms from over fertilizing with
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so even if you're growing a plant,
a wide variety of plants, some that are
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper accumulators, some that accumulate
at the micronutrient level, you can apply
[SPEAKER_01]: the same concentration to all of those
plants and you're not going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only instance in the literature where
they do show, um, abnormal floral
[SPEAKER_01]: development is when they were applying a
really high concentration of a liquid with
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon as a drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they, what I think was happening
is it was tying up low levels of either
[SPEAKER_01]: nickel or zinc in the growth media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were having a metal induced
deficiency, but at those levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are well above the recommended level
of any fertilizer that's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you're following the label
rates and, um, the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations that are on the packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of, um, a metal deficiency
should not occur with application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, finishing up, um, these,
the sources conversation, we, you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned biogenic sources, one of those
being, uh, rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've, you've, you've mentioned
off air to me that there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: potential sources, uh, that are,
that you can derive silicon from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about these as a
category and then more specifically rice
[SPEAKER_00]: holes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lots of plants, um,
especially within the grass and grains
[SPEAKER_01]: that take up high amounts of silicon and
they do so because they're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: depositing it into, uh, epidermal cells or
cells that are on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with these deposits, as the leaves
go back into the soil, this helps
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerate that silicon cycle and helps
break down and provide silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of different plants have
different mechanisms to get silicon up
[SPEAKER_01]: into foliar tissue, whether it's the
epidermal cells, trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then as those fall back down to
the ground, it can be released.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can take advantage of the plants
that take high concentrations of that like
[SPEAKER_01]: rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it goes into the rice halls and I,
sorry, don't have the number in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a, I think between 40 and 50% of
the nutrients that are present is silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a great source, but only if
those rice plants are grown and fertilized
[SPEAKER_01]: with silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we think of other things,
um, wheat straw, another great source,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the problem with wheat is you can also
get some pathogens carry over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Miscanthus has been tested bamboo,
um, um, kind of, uh, people are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into horsetail, um, and some other of
these really high accumulating species to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how they can incorporate either that
vegetation as a compost, um, with the rice
[SPEAKER_01]: halls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, uh, we were doing some work with
the USDA where we were making the rice
[SPEAKER_01]: halls into a biochar and seeing really
great responses, um, and using it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the rice halls, too, they are
starting to look at, um, extracting the
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon and making, uh, almost a nano
silicon material from the rice halls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting rid of everything else and
strictly using it for a silicon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other, um, biogenic forms
though, such as in pine needles,
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly enough, pine needles have a
really, really high concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon, but due to the chemical
composition, it doesn't break down and
[SPEAKER_01]: release over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though there's a lot there,
the phenolics and everything do not make
[SPEAKER_01]: it a viable source to incorporate or get
any of the silicon benefits out of those
[SPEAKER_01]: pine needles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there are options out there,
um, that can help as a more natural
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing to be aware of is how
was that source material grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: What silicon used in the production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it wasn't, and it's on land
that had been cultivated for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the silicon values are not going to be as
high as they should be from the trials
[SPEAKER_01]: that were published in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually seeing pretty big
variance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't just assume that because
they're rice halls, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: high in silicon, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as with rice halls being a waste or a
by-product, well, by-product waste in
[SPEAKER_01]: essence, um, they are not currently to my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone goes through and
there's no guaranteed analysis on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon composition are of the rice halls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really, um, unless you're
there, you're doing that on your own to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that you are getting that silicon
out of the rice halls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's kind of one of those things
that it could be hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be why some people who have
tried using rice halls to incorporate and
[SPEAKER_01]: have not been seeing the responses are not
seeing the responses because that silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't there like it is, um, in some of the
earlier trials where we were making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the starting material were fed
silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I see these charts, uh, floating
around the internet of, of variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different, um, nutrient values for
everything from, you know, various
[SPEAKER_00]: manures, fish, uh, fish meal, alfalfa,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but people don't take into account
like what that animal ate, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what, what it actually
accumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important, I think,
for folks to consider testing their
[SPEAKER_00]: sources or this is where guaranteed
analysis, uh, comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And labeling, um, which we will talk about
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the, I think we should probably get
into why the heck people would want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: silica in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the first place, I kind of jumped
ahead of you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk about all the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there, there are quite a few
benefits, especially if you are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: under silicon deficient type situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really what silicon is best known for
is to mitigate stress or to reduce stress
[SPEAKER_01]: in a plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants are constantly under changing
environmental condition, um, microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: attack, pest attack, insect, herbivore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of things are going on that they're
trying to compensate with, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: changes in water, um, from, you know,
over watering to under watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all of this, when we start putting
silicon back into the system, what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: is the plant, um, is now able to better
manage the stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a more balanced environment and
it's doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, what we're starting to see is
when we start feeding silicon,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can set up the barriers that are
present within the roots that can help
[SPEAKER_01]: hold the water in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can help reduce the transpiration
or the water loss through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by maintaining that water
constantly within the plant, what that
[SPEAKER_01]: does is it helps maintain a more balanced
concentration of all the other nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps the loot out waste products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just having that water response helps
the plants just better deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also helps them cool faster,
less susceptibility, um, to heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, less susceptibility to drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then on top of that, we also know
that silicon is involved in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymatic reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get, um, a pathogen attack or a
heavy metal toxicity, silicon can help
[SPEAKER_01]: offset what's going on within the cell and
help the immune system respond more
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when it comes to say a pathogen
disease, or it can also not just help
[SPEAKER_01]: with, um, reducing the enzymatic stress
from having too many or heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also keep the metals from actually
making it into the cytoplasm where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: having its effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bit deep there,
but really the responses of silicon is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants can deal with changes to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's hot or cold, wet or dry,
um, too much salt, too much sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also help when we have,
uh, toxicities, which you might not see
[SPEAKER_01]: too much in your garden, but you know,
if you're using some of the copper
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, you might see responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help mitigate against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the main thing that a lot of people
see though is disease reduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when we talk about our mildews,
um, or our bacterial diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the one coolest thing that you
can see that we don't talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: when we talk about fertilizers,
because then they want to label silicon as
[SPEAKER_01]: a pesticide, but it's not, it's a nutrient
because it's not acting directly on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, but it's reducing that,
um, infection process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're dealing with a lot of
mildews or bacteria, botrytis,
[SPEAKER_01]: root rot, silicon can help the plant have
a better response, a better immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are where you're going to see
more of a visual response when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you're saying there's
research related fungal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial, as well as insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's, you know, people think
that it's too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing I really want to point out
Silicon is involved in all of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all of these responses are not
directly due to Silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's due to how Silicon is bringing the
internal, um, environment within the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's allowing the genetics that are
already there to perform to the best
[SPEAKER_01]: ability that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where Silicon looks like
it's affecting all of these, but really
[SPEAKER_01]: what Silicon is doing is it's balancing
the plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's own responses can perform
to the best potential that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using Silicon in your garden doesn't
necessarily mean you're not going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis and spider mites and a variety of
other issues, but you may see less
[SPEAKER_01]: pronounced damage or it greatly reduces
these responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we, we start talking
about, um, you can, if you go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using any type of, um, if you're
using a pesticide or chemical to help
[SPEAKER_01]: control, what we see is you can use less
of that chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use less of these synthetic
responses because now you have a more
[SPEAKER_01]: robust, um, biological response by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same, um, like if you're using
beneficial insects or another means to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with this, if you don't have Silicon,
you're, you're missing out on a huge part
[SPEAKER_01]: of disease resistance or health for those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by bringing Silicon in,
it's going to help your IPM strategies,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, be a lot stronger and you can start
reducing costs, um, on some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: components, depending on what it is that
you're using to combat some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of, you know, going off of that,
uh, how do we best apply these Silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, some are going to be applied
directly to our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some are used as a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, does it make a difference,
uh, in terms of how we apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's say I know I'm starting to
see, but try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I be doing foliar applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a Silicon product versus, uh,
counting on there being sufficiency in my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great thing is, um, what I tell
growers and farmers apply it the best way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can work it into your system,
whether you're applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously if you have a solid product,
you're going to want to incorporate it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the media or the soil with the liquid
products you can apply either as a drench
[SPEAKER_01]: or foliar application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still seeing benefits from both
how the mechanisms are likely going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: different between a foliar application and
a root application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however you can get that Silicon into
your system is going to help the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's nice about applying it as a drench
when we're talking about liquids is it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be taken up through the root system and
transported all throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know with Silicon, similar to
calcium and copper and some of our other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, it doesn't load into the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it moves through the xylem tissue,
which means once you apply it to a leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to move out of that leaf
into other areas of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why with the foliar
applications, you have to do a continual
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar application so that the new
growing, um, tissue has a Silicon present
[SPEAKER_01]: for its developmental and, um,
health needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even with that though, we do,
there are benefits that are shown in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature with foliar application,
um, and definitely with using these
[SPEAKER_01]: materials as a drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the product itself,
they may suggest one application versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it really comes down to what's
going to be best to get it into your
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to help combat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it is a foliar pathogen moving
up through the root system, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into the internal portion of the leaf
and help have that response because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from an internal response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not coming from a physical barrier
that's just being formed on that leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening inside that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exactly what I wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we can do soil drenches
essentially, and still effectively treat
[SPEAKER_00]: disease in a reasonable timeframe,
um, for plant response.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my studies that I have done as a
graduate student and with USDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using Silicon as a drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just now this year starting to get
into looking at what effect foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: application has on some of these
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that, that leads me to a conundrum
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about, um, you know,
you mentioned foliar versus soil drench,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that makes me think of potassium
silicate and the labeling laws around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then I also want to talk about
heavy metals, which would you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's talk about heavy metals and then
we'll get into the legalities of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, talk to me about heavy metals
and, um, you know, some of these sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that might be something that
growers should be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, going back to the Rice Hall,
um, talk and how we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: these materials, Silicon's present in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same with our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have these hyper accumulators and we
aren't providing Silicon, it does they're
[SPEAKER_01]: craving the Silicon and it's kind of like
you going into your kitchen late at night
[SPEAKER_01]: craving chocolate and there's no chocolate
in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I shouldn't say you,
I'm going to, it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat everything that's present,
whether it's sweet, whether it's salty,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get that chocolate fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about plants that are
hyper accumulators, they are trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that Silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're turning on different transport
mechanisms, trying to scavenge any part of
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon out of that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, what we do is we get an
imbalance of nutrients in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, phosphate's one of them, but the sad
part about it is arsenic, cadmium,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these other heavy metals can also
be taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with arsenic, arsenic and Silicon have
very similar, um, chemical features.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very close on the right next door
to each other on the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the downsides that we know
with Rice, if Silicon's not present it
[SPEAKER_01]: will pull arsenic out of the soil profile
and people might not be aware of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have quite a bit of there's
arsenic, there's heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts, sorts of, um,
what we call contaminants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally occurring in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for the most part, the plants
don't take them up because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of the nutrients that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we get into these hyper
accumulators, the arsenic will move up to
[SPEAKER_01]: where the Silicon's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have something like Rice hauls
and we're starting to use that as our
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon fertilizer, we can start in
unintentionally be putting an arsenic,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, again, likely at low levels into our
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're growing plants in a Silicon
limited environment, they are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull that arsenic out and bio accumulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically for the cannabis
industry, this is a big concern because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the high amount of Silicon that they take
up, they are desperately trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that Silicon in any way that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is where a lot of the
issues with, um, the higher arsenic levels
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're seeing or the higher,
um, heavy metals that are being taken up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the plant because they don't have
those mechanisms in place that the Silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: would have used to reduce, um,
the movement of those metals into,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the cell and into other parts of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same that we've seen not
just for cannabis, but for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants as well is as soon as we
start putting Silicon into the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a reduction in, um, the
phytotoxicity of these metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are on a contaminated soil,
soil, and so they can kind of outgrow
[SPEAKER_01]: those negative responses, um, and still
provide a quality plant or quality fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a real gem of information
that we may be able to increase Silicon in
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant tissue as a way of reducing
heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I'm going to have to
do some more testing and research on
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, um, because it's a, it's a real
challenging cannabis, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, I do see a lot of
growers and soil suppliers using rice
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in their mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And um, you know, many of them are testing
their soil mixes, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you use, I assume if you use
like a acid extraction, um, for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, you would be able to, a strong
acid, you'd be able to see what is
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, one thing I want to go back to is
you mentioned that because rice holes are
[SPEAKER_00]: a waste product, there's no guaranteed
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get quite a bit of variability
batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're testing every,
every batch, I don't see how you could
[SPEAKER_00]: really determine your levels of arsenic
that you're bringing in every time you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: it into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the other thing, so I don't want
to scare people away from rice holes
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that it has arsenic, but the
potential is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even what you have to, it could even
be a trace level that's not even
[SPEAKER_01]: detectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a hyper accumulator,
it's going to bio accumulate very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very small amounts that might be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a very, you know, background,
no chemical is a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it's at that 0.001%,
it's going to be able to find it and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: it in trying to satisfy that silicon need
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, that's where the issue
comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that there's high contamination
of arsenic coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that, that background amount that's
there, that's no different than what 's
[SPEAKER_01]: out in our natural soil system that we
naturally have, you know, around us every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets accumulated in these species
because it's trying to find the silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, why it's, you know,
we consider these hyper accumulators that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be used for bioremediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon is one of those elements that it's
going to hyper accumulate, but if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not there, it's going to find something
else to take its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's more, we're always just
looking for what potential vectors are,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I find water to be one of the
biggest vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, dust that's kicked into facilities
can oftentimes bring it in water in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with metals, especially RO water
we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's a variety of other things,
not to single out ricels, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I think people should be
thinking about when, with all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs, but especially these ones like you
said that could hyper accumulate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that brings you back to the
adage that, you know, as you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do something that's a more natural source,
you still have to be careful because
[SPEAKER_01]: natural doesn't always mean the safest
source or the best source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just understanding where that
natural source is coming from and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: present in there and what's lacking in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that made me think of something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the pH of your media affect your
silica uptake, like with other nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an awesome question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that's kind of a loaded
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that main thing, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of studies that have looked
specifically at pH and uptake because,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm thinking in more of a soilist
media where you don't have that buffer
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity, really within that, the plant is
the major driver of what that pH of the
[SPEAKER_01]: media is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, you know, um, in growing
systems really work hard to maintain it
[SPEAKER_01]: within a certain pH range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so within those heavily regulated pH
ranges, um, you're going to get the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll have as large of an
effect because the solubility of silicon,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, between I think it's like four and
nine is going to be the same throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to get into a
situation where it's below four,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in soilists, you know,
you might in acidic soils or above nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so within that range, there's
really very little difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: if any, in the availability of maintaining
silicon in that 60 PPM or two millimolar
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're outside that pH range,
you have other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, trying to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does sound like a miracle,
uh, element, um, in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you're describing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think this is a good transition
into sort of the labels and products on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market because, um, there's,
there's challenges around labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really hard as a grower
to know how to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can we start off just talking a little
bit about potassium silicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's the one I'm most familiar with
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approved in organic production,
uh, as certain applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you kind of explain the,
the regulation around it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so all silicon, uh, products here in
the U S including the potassium silicates,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, are regulated through, um,
The fertilizer bio-stimulant soil
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments, um, portion of the state
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's regulated at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the American association of plant food
control officials or APCO is the governing
[SPEAKER_01]: body that gives recommendations to the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's up to each individual state
to determine, um, how if they accept those
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations or if they have their own
slight changes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where, um, some of these
labels that we see in some states such as
[SPEAKER_01]: say California, Washington, and Oregon
might look a little different than some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other Midwest states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that can add to some of the
confusion, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon, um, as it has just recently
within the past, uh, 15, 20 years been a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated fertilizer within this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently the APCO, uh, recommendations
are that when a silicon fertilizer is
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled, it's labeled with the percent
silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just percent SI and that's based off of
that five day extraction method I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that tells us is the amount of
salicylic acid that we can expect to be
[SPEAKER_01]: released from that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with this is it was developed
for our solid materials and not our liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a solid material basis,
what we tend to see is that the percent
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon that they put on the label for the
solid tends to overestimate the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: that we see in plant grow out trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it tells us there's a higher
number than what's actually released
[SPEAKER_01]: within that growing cycle for grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the liquid products,
the percent that we see is lower than what
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually see from the uptake within the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to underestimate liquids and
overestimate solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what an example of a
liquid in a solid is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for instance, the, and correct me
if I'm wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, is it the agro K?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a solid or a liquid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Agro K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the potassium, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg-sil?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the solid egg-sil, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So egg-sil is a powder that's a hundred
percent soluble that, um, like for
[SPEAKER_00]: example, we mix with water, uh,
as a way of creating a liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I was kind of confused in
terms of how you're defining these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, since it's applied as a
liquid, that would be, it would fall
[SPEAKER_01]: likely under the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the potassium silicates we work
with are already in the liquid form that
[SPEAKER_01]: we purchase from a distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about solids, these are
things like the diatomaceous earth will
[SPEAKER_01]: last the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's ignimbrite, the sand material,
all of these that are more solid
[SPEAKER_01]: components, that would be a soil or a
media incorporation are what we refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: as solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we have a number of different
silicon, uh, liquid silicon products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, um, some that we really don't
even know the source of, um, that refer
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the monosilicic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's calcium silicates that are in a
liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, with that, again, all of these
are, are recommended to provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: percent SI so that when we go in to
purchase, we are looking at how much
[SPEAKER_01]: silicic acid is released.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is since they're, every state
has the ability to allow the labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still products out there that
will give the percent SiO2 or even the
[SPEAKER_01]: percent silicic acid, which is SiOH4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that what that means is they can
put a higher number in that percent label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it's still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a 1% Si, which is a silicon,
they can say that it's 2% SiO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a consumer, you're just looking at
one versus 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then even with the SiO4,
a 1% Si would be a 3.4% SiOH4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so making sure that as we're reading
on these labels and we're understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: what that percent Si is, um, that's where
we need to make sure that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: these accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing though, a lot,
all of these liquid fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, are usually in concentrations above at
or above 3% Si, which is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is concentrated compared to what I
would suggest is an application rate of 30
[SPEAKER_01]: to 60 parts per million, which is 0.003.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've missed the zero in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so whether it's 1% or 3% Si,
all that means is you're going to either
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute it out more or less to get that
same response from the silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm understanding you correctly,
you're suggesting that we should convert
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these products to Si percentage,
just silicon, so we could convert and
[SPEAKER_00]: compare them apples to apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what APCO suggests for their
labeling recommendations when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no magic bullet proprietary
silicon chelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what other, uh,
buzzwords to hit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, that justifies a significantly
higher price point than really just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at Si percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about these liquid products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some products when we talk
about, um, performance, um, there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: instances where the formulation,
some of the formulations allow the
[SPEAKER_01]: products to have a much longer shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so some products only stay in solution
for maybe six months to two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then form a really thick silica gel
that is isn't going to provide anything to
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have other products that I've had
for over 15 years and are still in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are differences in formulation,
um, that might give an advantage of one
[SPEAKER_01]: product over another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, those aren't affecting the
silicon response that you're seeing if you
[SPEAKER_01]: apply that product at the same solicit
acid concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing, a lot of these
products are not a standalone silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: product like the potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they incorporate other bio
stimulants or other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's more of a blended fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not just getting that
silicon, but you're getting other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or bio stimulants that are
coming along with that silicon component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the products that tend to
show differences in plant size and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, because usually those plant size
and plant yield, those are not coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: the silicon response unless you're under
extreme stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those positive responses and plant
growth are coming from something else in
[SPEAKER_01]: that formulation, um, aside from the
silicon component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm just comparing the silica
portion of a product, um, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you said makes, makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for example, I'm looking at a
potassium silicate product right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a SI product that contains urea,
phosphoric acid, calcium nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these other ingredients,
um, along with potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to talk about just the
silica portion, that potassium silicate is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be essentially the same potassium
silicate that I'm getting from AgSil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as far as I understand, it's all
coming from the PQ corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this idea though, that, um,
we're getting a different silica response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not actually be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the SI is, is SI is SI is SI,
I guess, is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that- You are a hundred percent
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that safe to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon is silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very safe to say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, silicic acid is silicic acid,
no matter where it's coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's weathered from.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in that form, that's what's
taken up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you put everything on that
same plane as looking at comparing silicic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid to silicic acid, that's why that
percent SI from the five day method,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's not the best method that
could be out there, it's a, it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction method that at least gives us a
starting point, um, to start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: where they fall within that release rate
of the silicic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's coming from a potassium
silicate source, a calcium silicate
[SPEAKER_01]: source, whether it's at 6% or 3%,
it's silicon, silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take up as much as it wants
of the silicic acid and you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get similar responses independent of what
that starting material is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only say this because in the cannabis
industry, we have so many products and so
[SPEAKER_00]: many companies promoting products and
it's, it's very confusing and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of marketing hype and you know,
some of these products are just
[SPEAKER_00]: exorbitantly expensive because with
cannabis, you have a crop that's high
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can spend the money, but we don't
necessarily want or need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, it's good to hear, um,
that, you know, maybe we can look for a
[SPEAKER_00]: source that's more affordable knowing
that, um, at least that the silicon that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting is going to be essentially
taken up the same by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't care if it had a fancy
label or not, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
Correct.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on that topic, you brought up
monosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Solicic came and say it monosilic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is that a different form of Solicic
acid, um, as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not, I, I, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So orthosilic acid, monosilic acid and
Solicic acid, they all refer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: compound Si OH4, which means there's four
hydroxyl groups surrounding the silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that is the natural form that is a
single sub unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon is never, um, by itself in nature,
it's always interacting with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we say orthosilic acid,
that means it forms, and I'm not a
[SPEAKER_01]: chemist, so please don't quote me on all
this, but it's, um, it's just the form,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemical form of the formula and how
the hydroxyls come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monosilic acid refers that there's just
one silicon sub unit of the Solicic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I just, Solicic acid is the
easiest way to say it without adding the
[SPEAKER_01]: mono or the ortho, um, to try and not
scare so many people away, but it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a mouthful if you're talking about
the single silicon compound that is
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbed by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, I'm really glad you brought
it up because I'll have someone say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're, you know, you don't want to
use molassonite or calcium silicate
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have a highly concentrated
monosilic acid product and making it sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's something inherently very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'm glad that you, you touched on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, did you want to add anything before I
move on to the last topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, no, just with that, um,
really it all comes down to that percent
[SPEAKER_01]: Si.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's on its own as a,
there are some products that do have a
[SPEAKER_01]: really high concentration of Solicic acid
that don't have a calcium or calcium or
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium that's in combination, but they
have other components in that mix that's
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing it to stay in that high
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, looking at percent Si,
that's where you're going to start putting
[SPEAKER_01]: everything on an equal playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where that five day extraction
comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't care if it's a straight
Solicic acid, if it's combined with
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or any of the polymers that are out
there, it's strictly looking for how much
[SPEAKER_01]: of that is going to be in the Solicic acid
form for the plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is one thing I forgot to
touch on with you was, uh, one form of
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon, which is Silicon dioxide and
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that before we move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so again, that's, uh, Silica,
uh, the availability is really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on how it was formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about the Silica
from a volcanic eruption, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more of a glassy type thing,
it's still amorphous, but it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same surface features of a biogenic
Silica, which is the Opal that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about in like the rice halls and
the grass grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, really how that Silica was formed
is going to play a role in the release
[SPEAKER_01]: rate because there's some results that
we've found that even that recycled glass
[SPEAKER_01]: that they heat up really, really high and
it becomes really porous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've found that even that recycled
glass, which is a Silica releases a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant amount of Silicon where we can
actually see increases in Silicon and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant treatment when we put a certain
amount into the growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does release, we know it can release
Solicic acid, but the amount of release is
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to depend on how it was
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're seeing good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned, uh, briefly biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if a high Silicon material is
pyrolized, you're getting a good Silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we were comparing,
we had rice halls that we knew were coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from a source that had high Silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were using the rice halls and then they
were also, um, pyrolized at the 700
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Celsius in, um, the Muffle
furnace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the oxygen was deprived and we were
seeing, uh, similar amounts of Solicica or
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon accumulation in a graph study
between those two types of treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, big fan of biochar in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But biochar, just like everything else,
you need to know the source because not
[SPEAKER_01]: all biochar, um, is going to release,
uh, or have a high concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what the starting
source is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar has a lot of the labeling
challenges and issues as many other things
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you so much for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are the differences across,
uh, various media sources in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon uptake and plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that too big of a question to answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that too big of a question to end the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you asking like media components?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hydroponics versus soilist versus,
uh, actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge, it's a huge question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with soils, especially when we're in
our heavier with our clay, obviously we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a high, um, a high potential
for Solicic acid release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when we get into things like our
sandier soils that reduces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but they're still seeing great
responses when we are fertilizing with
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon fertilizers on the heavy clays and
on the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still a lot more to the story
that we're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into these hydroponics systems
though, and soilist media, we're really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really lacking that parent material and
minerals that are going to give us that
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline amount of Silicon that's needed,
especially with these hyperaccumulation
[SPEAKER_01]: layers or macro accumulators of Silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, things like perlite and vermiculite
can add a small amount of Silicon to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we're using certain water
sources, um, we found well water is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to give us a little bit more boost at
least here in Ohio, where it's percolating
[SPEAKER_01]: through clay parent material, then our
surface water is giving us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you're still getting a small
amount if that water is coming,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, from a non-distilled source,
which I don't know many people that use
[SPEAKER_01]: distilled water, um, or purified water in
those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but still it's, it's greatly lacking
for the responses that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get into these
hydroponic systems, um, if you're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: Beto bucket system with a hundred percent
perlite, we're actually finding that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is quite a bit of Silicon that's being
taken up by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we ran analysis of the Silicon
concentration in the reservoir of our
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite buckets, they were very similar to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was present in our two millimolar
Silicon treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there is a potential that in those
types of systems, you might not need as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the Silicon fertilizer as you
would in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we get into NFT systems,
um, your fertilizer source for those
[SPEAKER_01]: systems and your water source are going to
dictate how much Silicon might be there as
[SPEAKER_01]: a background, but it's still likely going
to be well below that 60 PPM concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: that you would need to add continually or
weekly to that solution to maintain enough
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon for the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I missing any of the media?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the only other thing that you and I
had talked about, uh, that I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of counterintuitive for me is I
mentioned this, uh, these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what people call living soils,
these highly enriched soil is media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's what our, you know, my company
produces, uh, for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, and we add rock dusts and we have
a compost fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some, you know, Silla Silicon
sources in our media already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you had mentioned that you saw
better results related to, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil applications with some of these,
you know, sands and things because of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the micro, the microbiome, we don't,
we're not even scratching the surface with
[SPEAKER_01]: our understanding of Silicon weathering
and movement between all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects within the rhizosphere,
within the bacteria and within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may see some sort of, um,
SI soluble utilizing bacteria or archaea
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially produced down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, what's interesting there,
they're likely already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bacillus species that everybody has
come to know and love, um, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere, um, species that we're
already using as an oculum are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been identified as being
important in the Silicon mineralization
[SPEAKER_01]: within soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is likely that we're already putting
the potential in there as, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: silicate mineralizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we just have to give them the food to
help them break that down even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually, you can have that
continual release and that beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: response, um, from the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we use a very fine rock dust,
um, and a couple different sources of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust that are pretty high in, uh,
Silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as well, um, as, as well as a couple
other things with the idea being because
[SPEAKER_00]: folks are reusing their media,
which is not as common in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture and floriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these things will become available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SI will become available down the
road, even if it's not there that first
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just thinking about, well,
it, the rock dust being there present,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and with reusing the media,
what you're doing is you are supporting a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial community that I don't think a
lot of people think about that are
[SPEAKER_01]: colonizing these nutrient rich areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're actually selecting for the
bacteria that are able to live and survive
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, as you're using it year after
year, um, the efficiency of that
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralization will likely increase,
um, as that source, you know, as they're
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to benefit from the plants that
are growing in there, um, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that are available and haven't
been used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use a larger volume of soil
relative to what, or soilless media
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to what most growers
traditionally would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in beds or, you know,
15, 20, 30 gallon pots in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that plays a role in,
in the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we, we tend to see our better
yields and plant health, um, on the second
[SPEAKER_00]: or third cycle, which puts us six months,
four to six months down the road versus
[SPEAKER_00]: that first, uh, you know, 60 days,
55 days that that initial crop is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that would, I think it's an
interesting hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wonder about in terms of
the research you've seen is these types,
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of media, that, um, I found,
you know, qualitatively looking under the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope tends to be more biologically
active than traditional soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I'm not, you know, doing DNA
analysis on what the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, uh, microbes are to a,
to a species, but I, I, I wonder if,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, research would show different results
versus, um, you know, a more, a more
[SPEAKER_00]: common soil is media like ProMix or
something, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like from what it sounds,
so ProMix and the soil is media that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it isn't microbial inert,
but it's nowhere near what soils are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking about a highly
intense or, you know, um, a well blended,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, living soil where you are providing
the nutrients, you're providing the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and, you know, one that is a
well adapted for enhancing the growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbes, the growth of the plant,
that's a lot different than a soil system
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're just applying fertilizer to,
and we're putting plants in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even though we're working,
you know, we can be putting in compost
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, to me, it sounds like these
types of living soils are a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more calculated and more balanced than
what you would see out in a typical,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, agriculture soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that you're seeing more
microbial, um, growth or more microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: action that, excuse me, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, obviously, you know, having some type
of data to look at those two would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in essence, that's, you know,
you're just, you're really working on
[SPEAKER_01]: creating the perfect environment to
culture both the microbes and the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you would expect to see,
I think, a more dense population or a more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient response within those types of
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hope we see more research down
the road, but it's such a complex topic
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would be so challenging to research
anyway, just because there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: so much variability, uh, at the microbial
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if we'll ever get there,
but yeah, no, no, I'm sure people will
[SPEAKER_01]: try, um, and come up with really great
inferences from that, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you try to control the variables or,
you know, to be able to even start to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare studies to one another,
it's, it's going to be a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, well, I'm, I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really inspired me to, uh,
revisit, uh, Silicon and how I might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to better utilize it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I really just thank you for your
time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are absolutely welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything that I can help
yourself or your viewers, please just
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm always open to sharing any and all
information that I've got through these
[SPEAKER_01]: past 17 years, um, with whoever is
interested in learning about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll put some, uh, you know,
some links and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think what would be really useful is
a conversion chart if those are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks could easily compare products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, hopefully as more research
comes out, uh, you and I can chat again,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Dr. Wendy Zellner, and you are
