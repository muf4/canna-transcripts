[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Nicole Gauthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a professor and extension
specialist at the University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her program focuses on disease management
of specialty crops, including hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In her extension role, she develops
educational and outreach programs to help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers manage disease through
identification, understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystems, and integration of
management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research program focuses on a range of
hemp diseases, including Fusarium head
[SPEAKER_00]: blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gauthier earned her bachelor of
science in horticultural science and her
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD in plant pathology from Louisiana
State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She joined the UK College of Agriculture
in 2011 and began working with industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link on the podcast page
to access her resources and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen on LinkedIn that Paul Coxon,
who's been on the show before,
[SPEAKER_00]: had linked to some of your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reached out to you directly and you
were so kind to take my message messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we just start off telling
listeners a little about yourself and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we can talk a little about your research?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a plant pathologist, which means I
study disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I am I'm a professor of
plant pathology with a specialization in
[SPEAKER_01]: extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So extension specialist is what a lot of
farmers call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by extension, meaning that we are the
interface between the university and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every state has extension faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then most counties within a state will
have another component of extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I specialize in plant diseases and by
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with specialty crops and hemp has
been on my commodity assignment since 2014
[SPEAKER_01]: when the reintroduction came through with
a 2014 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sort of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bridging the gap between academia and
the university and then the actual farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers in your fall into your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that that is correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can work directly with farmers as
long as it is a plant disease issue or I
[SPEAKER_01]: can work with county agents as part of
their larger programing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I write a lot of spray guides and
fact sheets and do a lot of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we train growers and we train county
agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of trainings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, in the modern era,
our trainings can be anything from YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything from YouTube to just some some
featured videos that are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: more published than some of our raw video
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, let's just let's just go ahead
and dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that we talked
about off air was just getting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation and understanding of sort of
what plant disease is and what those what
[SPEAKER_00]: those are in sort of the hemp cannabis
world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we'll start by saying that plant
diseases, those are the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a plant's reaction to whatever is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an it's a it's a disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about disease,
we use terms like wilt and rot and blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are usually descriptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have disease names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of more colloquial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of entomology or think of plant
names like we don't use the Latin binomial
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using common names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what diseases are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disease names are common names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll call flower blights or leaf
spots or sarcospora leaf spot or bipolaris
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf spot powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of some some some common
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diseases are caused by plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we get into fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria, viruses, water molds or
oomycetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when we start talking,
start talking with the Latin binomials
[SPEAKER_01]: that most people don't really like to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, any pathologists would love to
talk to talk the nerdy Latin to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so when I study and when when a lot of
times we make references, we do make
[SPEAKER_01]: references to those Latin binomials
because that causal agent or that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, the fungus, the bacteria,
the water mold, it's really critical that
[SPEAKER_01]: we know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my research comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's yes, I have the education
and outreach component from Extension,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's where our research really dives
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question is we're trying
to figure out what exactly are those
[SPEAKER_01]: causal agents or are they the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the same sarcospora that causes a
leaf spot on soybeans or on tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it a different sarcospora,
for example, that causes the leaf spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: On cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of part of the research
that I do is kind of a fancy diagnostic,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, and then understanding the
life cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the alternative host?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that host range?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it overwinter?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the optimal conditions for
infection to occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: And thus does the disease matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it just make a spot, for example,
on that leaf and it doesn't matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it something that can be really
devastating and detrimental to a crop and
[SPEAKER_01]: cause crop losses or food safety issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: So nutshell, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like identification is
critical in the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's something that in
reality kind of gets skipped over or I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess push the side a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, from a grower perspective,
how important is it that I know the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: species or can I just say oh, this is
powdered mildew because of the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's enough for me to at least begin
a treatment option or for something else
[SPEAKER_00]: like fusarium or one of these other more
common diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to dive that deep as a
cultivator or can we just sort of narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're talking to the pathologist,
so I'm going to say absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time, though, yes,
we're finding more and more as we have
[SPEAKER_01]: more modern techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're starting to understand a little
bit about just crops in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did this management technique work
five years ago or why is it working for my
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor and it's not working for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be really the pathogen itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use fusarium as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are not pathologists,
they talk about fusarium as if it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different fusarium
complexes and species that we're finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, as a fusarium wilt,
we have identified four different form of
[SPEAKER_01]: species of fusarium oxysperum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're finding a lot of different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts to matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That matters on how it overwinters,
what the other hosts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do a lot of fungicide sensitivity
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I don't want to get anyone in
an uproar, but fungicides are used for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of crops across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in plant pathology, that's one of the
ways we characterize pathogens is what is
[SPEAKER_01]: that sensitivity?
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do temperature sensitivities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of different characterization
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fungicide sensitivity is kind of like
in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows differences, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about species.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between a cat and a
lion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge difference in what we know
in our everyday life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just as much difference across,
for instance, fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fusarium oxysperum grew for the
fusarium, all the other species,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones we're working on that cause a bud
and flower blight, head blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very different and it matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can matter more than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question, you mentioned powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there are two different
powdery mildews, different genera of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of them can survive at about a
40% relative humidity and the other one
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 70% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% relative humidity, really plants are
unhappy at that level versus 70% relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are really happy there,
but so are most of your fungal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a million other examples of how
species are generous sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really makes a difference in the grand
scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that was a very compelling argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So should a grower care?
[SPEAKER_01]: A commercial grower should absolutely
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small grower or a backyard grower or
somebody with a grow in their basement
[SPEAKER_01]: won't matter as much, but a commercial
grower should absolutely know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's really that sometimes that
difference between that real good profit
[SPEAKER_01]: margin or that really high level efficacy
of a management strategy versus just okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically saying that even within
Fusarium, we're going to have ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: have different temperature ranges,
different humidities, different spread,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things are factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a grower then, so if I were to
walk into my room, let's talk about an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So controlled environment, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see something on a plant that looks off
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I determine that that's a disease
and not a nutrient deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some keys that I would look for
in terms of a physical display?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what should I do at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are my next steps from a pathology
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember symptoms are not a diagnostic
feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know, you need to see the
signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find those fungal spores or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a grower is not going to have that
capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect you to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you walk into your basement or your
huge facility or a field, like whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of walk in, you take a look
across, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of take that wide angle view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that first look.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the pattern?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a nutrient deficiency,
it may be across the entire block or the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire house or whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planting dates, when I talk about block,
it could be planting date, it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, it could be a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look across that entire block,
a nutrient deficiency can very likely be
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant diseases are rarely all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually, we usually have hot
spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're on a drip irrigation system
and you have an irrigation issue or a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility issue, there may be some kind of
pattern, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's a cold end of a greenhouse,
maybe you have an air leak on the cold end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start to see kind of patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The low end of the field, the high end of
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold part of the greenhouse,
where is the heater that maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't believe how many people have
gas powered heaters or kerosene heaters in
[SPEAKER_01]: their greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it may be something like if there's a
clog in one of the irrigation lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe all of row 10 looks different than
the other row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the pattern?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to look a little bit
more closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the entire plant that's going down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just the new leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just the old leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just one side?
[SPEAKER_01]: So right, a fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one side will start showing symptoms
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the pattern within the
individual plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at multiple plants,
but what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, then my number three is
you go down into the soil or the media and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to look at roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be mechanical damage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rodents, for example, a lot of rodent
issues or if it was a clogged irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system, what does the root system look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a root rot issue, what are the
roots look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to kind of look there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're still just gathering information
at that point, but you're giving a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweeping look and you're closing in,
closing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, from a leaf, for example,
if you have a root rot, well, then you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have a leaf die back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wilt, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're losing roots,
you're not getting the water and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake that you need because the roots
aren't there to do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have a wilt maybe
consistently for an entire week or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: when it cools off at night, you'll the
plant will recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that kind of wilt and recover
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you might have a marginal leaf scorch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marginal leaf scorch is an uptake issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a root problem or maybe salt
buildup in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of gathering, it's kind of
like an investigation, if you will,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just eliminating the obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you still keep saying, OK,
I'm still going back to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still I'm still thinking there's a
root problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you can investigate a little
closer or you can say this is a very clear
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fungal structures inside that
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to leaf spot or a bud
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bud blight generally won't affect the
leaves or, you know, so it kind of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of putting together all of that that
information so that you can take that
[SPEAKER_01]: first guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will be patterns or there will
be hot spots or there will be something to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes some thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no book.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no checklist that gets you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's experience and feel, but it's also
taking that wide angle look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you, if you were on Facebook or
Instagram, see a photo of a cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to diagnose it just right from
that photo as having Fusarium or,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, powdery mildew, I guess is
probably an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pottery mildew is the only easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's my question, because I see
this all the time where you're like you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see people post photos and they're like,
oh, that's Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's Phytoptera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just as a pathologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, there are very few pathogens that
we actually see that we see the signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we're seeing the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are going to communicate,
for example, you and I are very far apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you called me, I would say send me
five pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the whole greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the entire site.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to look for patterns for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sending photographs and just trying to
narrow it down and exactly that pattern of
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, that thought process that I just
laid out to show me one leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarely to show me one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was a Fusarium wilt, for example,
I would make you cut into that stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make you cut into healthy plant
stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make you tell me the history of
that site.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make you tell me a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until I saw those spores, I would not,
especially in a commercial in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, tell you that you have a specific
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a jeweler's loop, for example,
or I don't know if you're familiar with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dino light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little fancier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have dino lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got proscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dino light too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just go with dino light because
that's kind of a little bit better than a
[SPEAKER_00]: jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a grower with a dino light,
what diseases could I identify with that
[SPEAKER_00]: tool on my plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you growers who don't know,
a dino light is a USB powered little
[SPEAKER_01]: handheld microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And magnification can get pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a fungal structure like a
pycnidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So septoria leaf spot is an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody wants to just Google
septoria leaf spot, just write right up on
[SPEAKER_01]: their computer as they listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside that leaf spot, that fungus will
produce a structure, a survival structure
[SPEAKER_01]: called a pycnidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pycnidia are like capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a size of a black pepper flake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're raised, like little
pimple-like raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside are those microscopic spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pycnidia are very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a pathologist's standpoint,
they're very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Young eyes can see them without a
jeweler's loop, without a hand lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you zoom into some of those types
of spots, you can see capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called canidia and canidiophores,
canidia or asexual spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stand up on little stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stalks are called canidiophores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the canidia will be on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look like maybe little bristles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with a dino light or even a
jeweler's loop and good sunshine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see those structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, you become familiar with
the same ones over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put me in a wheat field,
and I'll be able to use my loop to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify certain structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You become trained with the things that
you see over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a fungal disease and it
sporulates, we can usually see enough that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can circle back to this in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your question was, what does a grower
do in the meantime?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could double back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually if I see enough, we can give a
grower some guidance until we get that
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmation from the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are fungal structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never see bacterial cells with a
dino light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see oozing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see water soaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will never see viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses are the absolute hardest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even symptom-wise, it's very hard to
guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with a dino light, you can see
things like a root infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see where that infection might
have taken place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pythium will infect from the root
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas black root rot, you'll see lesions
within the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the root, you'll see those small
lesions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lesion nematode is another one,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lesion nematode kind of goes in right to
the side of the root, and it'll create a
[SPEAKER_01]: small lesion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, I was talking about
narrowing down from the field level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also narrow down when you're at
that magnified level, even if it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: high-powered microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: From even that hand lens or dino light
level, you can start narrowing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, root tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this flower blight is on the bract or
on the pedicel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And magnification gets you closer to those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a better communication for you and I,
so that when you do submit that sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the right sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we can help you with
a management strategy until we get that
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmation back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I kind of want to we could go
one of two ways here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to talk about some of these
diseases and their life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to talk about treatment
options, because like the first thing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you say, you know, when I think of a lot
of these things that are on the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, I want to spray something like
SufoilX, like a mineral oil based,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of oil based suffocant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there better options that are safe and
approved in cannabis than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there something?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach that, I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in a really difficult position
with cannabis because the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are out there are they're new to cannabis,
they're new to these production systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in cannabis, there's a lot of
misinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you've got this podcast,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm working in this space,
because there's so much to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oils are really not good fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for suffocating a lot of
arthropods, but they're not something I
[SPEAKER_01]: would ever list in my fungicide arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of there are a lot of
biologicals that are really just starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to, we're just starting to understand
them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your bacillus products,
your trichodermas, the Eulacladium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just starting to see some of
these products come on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I am really loving a lot of
those bacillus products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some really good ones out there
and trichodermas also have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say that we use biologicals
differently than we use our conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not wait for disease and spray and
oh, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the opposite, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have some preventative
measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can circle back to we can circle
back to cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to be able to use these
products as often living objects,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either SARs or they're living
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they also need humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also need certain conditions to
survive and to do on that leaf and to do
[SPEAKER_01]: what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of questions about
persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are they on that leaf,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you spray, how long are they on that
leaf or on that leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are they on that flower or in
that soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to be learned there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best things I think we have on the
market are your bacillus products and your
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do not have a favorite bacillus from
what I have tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really work pretty well, all pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some research going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me again in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to have a lot more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far what we know, they're all kind
of right there doing the best that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can with what we throw at them with a
monocultured system in a very humid indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, farmers are abusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't treat our plants well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put a lot we put a lot on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that surprises me a little bit
about oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the oils because and this is
another thing to talk about, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how much are insects and pests
spreading disease or pathogens to around
[SPEAKER_00]: your room and killing some of these
arthropods, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think could I assume would have some
effect as well on reducing or preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: disease spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had really good success with
biologicals once I've identified disease
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like at that point it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear you just talk a
little more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking in my head, I'm thinking
of powdery mildew just to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more context.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your biologicals, I like to say they're
not a magic bullet in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing cures disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our conventional fungicides,
which, by the way, there are no label for
[SPEAKER_01]: any cannabis or hemp product, your
conventional fungicides, they're tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really good and they can suppress.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a great big bandaid for two to
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your biologicals don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your biologicals must be used
preventatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be used preventatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say the same thing about our
conventional fungicides, but they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: staying power that biologicals don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a history of a disease,
you must use your biologicals
[SPEAKER_01]: preventatively or the first sign or first
symptom of a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew is like easy, but it's
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mixed feelings about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: With powdery mildew, and for those who
don't know, what you're looking at is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a mass of knidia and knidia fours.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the knidia fours that stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the knidia are those hyaline or
clear asexual spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they form in chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are chains of spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fluffier that mycelia is, the longer
those chains of spores are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you do when an indoor grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got fans on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're blowing it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see powdery mildew,
you've got more spores than you could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly count on a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really high numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes powdery mildew so hard
to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also remember, there are a couple of
different powdery mildews out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them in particular,
it's relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can infect at a relative humidity of
about 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the situations where
it's sometimes hard to even use cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practices for management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any human risk with the amount of
spores in the air when you do spot powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew in a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go running out of there to put
on a mask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it not something to worry about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would not be something to worry about
unless you're immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are immunocompromised,
it's really hard to be in any agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: setting for just a lot of the things we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing about powdery mildew,
can I add one thing about powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you don't know is that powdery
mildew, the white, the nice fluffy white
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew that you see, if you will,
that is only, that's the asexual stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: that fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so later in the season or the end of
its life or as plants begin to senesce,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will produce a different type of
structure called a chasmathesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is an overwintering capsule that
will, that's going to initiate that sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: recombination, that sexual stage,
but it's also the overwintering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chasmathesia are like some little
round Velcro balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have appendages and they stick
to things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your powdery mildew is gonna stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna stick to anything that's
coarse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any kind of wood, any kind of table
legs or any kind of pots or containers or,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's gonna stick on everything
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the field, it's sticking on the stems
and debris and it's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once those chasmathesia, they're
black, they're dark colored.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means they're melanized.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're melanized, they're UV
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are heat tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cold tolerant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fungicide resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is that carryover from season to
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following a greenhouse in between,
but sanitizing a greenhouse in between
[SPEAKER_01]: crops is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you're leaving those chasmathesia
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're back to that life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leave those chasmathesia in place each
year you've got, or each crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got more and more of that inoculum
in place ready to infect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many questions, but let me start with a
couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first question is, are the powdery
mildews that we're seeing in cannabis also
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that could be, could other plants be
carriers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether those are cover crops,
squashes, I think of like in my outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, just so I don't forget my
questions, biologicals, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned being effective are challenging
in that we can't, a lot of states are
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for microbial contamination on the
buds themselves and not differentiating
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species in terms of what's safe and not
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how effective is just water at
killing powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that it can, you know,
there's a physical mechanism of just
[SPEAKER_00]: rinsing it off the leaves too potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sorry, that was a lot of questions,
but I don't want to forget them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of questions and that's two
hours worth of answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the first question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've forgotten the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other carriers, other cross species
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we finding and back to speciation
and my, my favorite thing in the world to
[SPEAKER_01]: do speciate everything is that our powdery
mildews basically do have a wider host
[SPEAKER_01]: range than we have, than we have known in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Golavenomyces chicoracearum or
Golavenomyces spidaceus absolutely is the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that you're going to see on
wildflowers, on weeds, on other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you always see it on weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm picturing indoor facilities that
run cover crops inside the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, some of these cover crops
have very narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to look really closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible that you may not be seeing
the spores or, or something like that too,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it manifests differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's not as preferred host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it, you know, and so it will
look differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, again, so we've got a lot
of levels and you and I were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a lot of different types of
growers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your listeners are probably in a very
wide range from two plants on the back
[SPEAKER_01]: patio to a commercial facility that is
sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in your larger facilities,
you would be surprised at how much outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: air is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember the fluffiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember everything you see in powdery
mildew is spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're microscopic spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of powdery mildew blowing
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just air exchange through a fan,
through an open window, through some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bringing that powdery mildew in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and again, once it's in there,
it's there for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm going to laugh and I'm going
to tell you that this pathologist cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of powdery mildew in her own
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just invested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done everything and we can't get
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about the entry it is coming in
and then it's building up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you have powdery mildew,
which everybody does, once you have
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew, if you, you know,
how many of us are guilty about after we
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, we leave the plants in place,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really get rid of them like we
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so that's when you start seeing
those chasmathesia develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not see them, but they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it only grow on living tissue,
powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew can only establish and,
and, and survive, no, live, but it will
[SPEAKER_01]: survive as survival structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go, you can go years with
those chasmathesia, those survival
[SPEAKER_01]: structures being viable and waiting for a
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm full of bad news, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does tilling the soil have any positive
effects in terms of potentially killing
[SPEAKER_00]: the chasmathesia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the correct word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I saying it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually somewhere on some surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not as much on this,
on the soil or in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tilling it into debris, tilling the
debris in, yes, that will bury it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's in other places, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a hemp field, it's on fence
posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, you know, it's clinging to
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clinging everywhere and there's
always some debris, there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: something around, but in an indoor
facility, I don't know any grower who
[SPEAKER_01]: truly does a full disinfestation between
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wash floor to ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So myrrh filters though can be effective
at reducing that, or is that getting
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of your area?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's getting outside of my area,
but your, your filter size, your,
[SPEAKER_01]: will affect, you know, it determines which
particle size gets in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still have to walk in,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the best facilities are,
are rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just filtration, but opening of
doors and you walk in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been outside and you walk straight
into work during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really suit up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really shower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not many, even our best grows are
not a, not the level of a containment
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come in and once it's in,
it's very, it's going to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's, that's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm wondering then is,
you know, we talked a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: these biologicals and how in a lot of
states we have testing that doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_00]: us to effectively use them because of the,
the regulations essentially, which leads
[SPEAKER_00]: me back to oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my question about water and sort
of mechanical means of removing powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, how effective are those things say
in the vegetative state before we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation, the flower formation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with your second
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about how powdery mildew infects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, so this is a cuticle infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the infection is right under the
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not literally on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sporulation is on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a, there's a level of
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wash it down, you have spread
those spores and then you have not gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of the infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungus will pop back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would not, I would not waste my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see where that could even buy you
any time, like 12 hours, but powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew sporulates right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a missed bench for a example,
if you have cuttings and you have a missed
[SPEAKER_01]: bench, yeah, powdery mildew is not real
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you haven't gotten rid of
the infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kept it, kept it at bay for
however long your plants are under the
[SPEAKER_01]: mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what tools do we have then as a grower
in our current system, besides oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we haven't talked about soaps at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those are insecticidal soaps or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those have any fungicidal properties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, we've got, we've got,
I don't like to mention products,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are a couple of products on the
market that do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And regalia does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a study that we use Cease,
which is a bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cease does a good, a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used properly with other cultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of been our best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at some of my old work,
a student did a project several years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: where one of our growers had to use
organic milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did, and that was one of the most
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you need a lot of applications,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just one, one application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most growers, especially any grower
who goes from a conventional system into
[SPEAKER_01]: something like cannabis that you can't use
conventional products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're highly disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some products that work well
when combined with cultural practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: when combined with air circulation and
following greenhouses in between crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heard about that study like that
through the giant pumpkin community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wonder if this was,
if your student and you were the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: did that original study or you guys
replicated something around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we just did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it when we were looking at some
products in powdery mildew in hemp in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we, we had all kinds of
crazy things in that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything a grower told us, they used all
the, you know, the anecdotes and whole
[SPEAKER_01]: wives tales.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of threw those in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had B propolis and we had all kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the milk, the organic whole milk,
and it was a powdered milk mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the details of the study,
but it did pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you know anything you use that's not
systemic?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to spray on a five
day interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's, that's a good point then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every five days just because of the
life cycle of the, of the mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know if it was, an enzyme or
something in the milk itself or the
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know a lot of growers are using
lactobacillus and making their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they call labs essentially and
spraying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something I pursued.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some powdery mildew work years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've since worked on other things,
so I don't remember the details of that
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can find it, I'll give it to you to
link to your, in your bio and your show
[SPEAKER_01]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but yeah, it's a powdery mildew
stuff, especially indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little about what some
of the other diseases are that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing prevalence of and maybe how they're
misunderstood or misdiagnosed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go forever on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another really common one in indoor
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I say indoor, that means a true
indoor closed facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could mean a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could mean a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could mean anything except the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to use that term very
generally, but any indoor environment
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're using a soil is media.
[SPEAKER_01]: The premise, the premise there,
and now this can also include hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything in that line as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, we'll call it sterile for
lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have the antagonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the, the micro-organisms
that you would in a field situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll kind of set the scene there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pythium is probably number two right
behind powdery mildew and any indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: any soil is mix or soil is or hydroponic
system, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there are no
antagonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we do a lot of watering in a soil is
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also in, it's wet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're either flood, we're either flood
inching, or we are, you know, having
[SPEAKER_01]: dripping and just, just, it's just wet in
an indoor environment because we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: pour through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pythium is a water mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an O my seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a true fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once pythium comes in, it's got
roots, it's got water, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another really persistent
fungus that is, or pathogen rather,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, not, it's not a fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really persistent pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of growers struggle with and
often fail to recognize what's really
[SPEAKER_01]: going on because it manifests as a
nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It manifests as a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you get wilting and the more
you, more it wilts, the more you water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more you water, the happier pythium is
because it's water mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of pythium in our
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we have five different types
of different species that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the cool weather pythiums and
we've got the really hot greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of pythiums out there
from across the board and we're finding
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just knowing you have pythium would be
a big deal, but to know which one you have
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of complicates things unless you have
a lab that's willing to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we, when we suspect we have
pythium, our identifiers, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to lead the above ground
material is going to look a lot like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiency, but I would assume
when you dig down into that media,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see a very distinctive,
I mean, I've always called it root rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of brown slimy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what are the distinguishing
characteristics of pythium relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: other pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for everybody listening, when you,
when you expose those roots, rinse very
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to break those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those roots are really brittle when
they're infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your younger, younger plants are going
to become infected more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: A young plant like, right, a new cutting
or a seedling or just a young plant has
[SPEAKER_01]: more of those young tender roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older a plant is, the less,
the less problem you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: With pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an early season disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas nutrition is usually a problem
later in the growth, the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium is a root nibbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes in on the root tips,
the very tips, and it goes upwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once roots get tough and strong,
yeah, it doesn't really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see them more on the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you rinse slowly and you take a
look at those roots, so you were saying
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown and mushy, that's extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to catch it before that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's that extreme, you got
stunting and dying and, but whereas if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a, if it's the beginning stages and
you've just got that myoclerosis or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it's stunting, maybe it's not,
I'm not real sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be the cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's, when it's at that low level,
looking at those roots, so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the tips of the roots with your
dinolite or your hand lens or whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to magnify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of my growers who have an old
fashioned magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be too proud for a magnifying glass,
whatever it takes to magnify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you want to look at is the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root of an effected, an infected root
will be flatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be really turgid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be discolored, not necessarily
Brown, maybe starting to turn a little
[SPEAKER_01]: gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the tip, very easily, the cortex
will slough off and just that steel will
[SPEAKER_01]: stick out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call that rat tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a rat tail root tip is my favorite
indicator of Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So picture again, the cortex sloughed off
and just the steel sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's maybe as much as an inch,
but you have to rinse your roots very
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully so you don't break them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see those sometimes with the
naked eye, the older I get, the less of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeing things with the naked eye are
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little bit of magnification,
heck, turn on your phone camera and zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I spot Pythium on my plants,
they're looking, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you caught it in early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We growers tend to diagnose these things
probably too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But assuming we caught it early,
what options do we have for treatment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bad news again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of your trichoderma products are
good preventatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever have Pythium in your
greenhouse, you probably still have
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying greenhouse, your indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably still have Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, following, starting over,
cleaning, disinfecting, sanitizing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, every tool, every piece of
equipment from wheelbarrow to garden hose
[SPEAKER_01]: to flushing out your irrigation lines,
cleaning everything out and starting from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that when you get a delivery
of your media, you're not throwing it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprising how many people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then your media becomes contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to go in and if you have a history to
go with something like a trichoderma or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really you want to get those plants to
that six week stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get to that six or eight week
stage, they toughen up and they're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good unless you really have a severe
infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium is a soil borne pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lives its entire life in the soil,
which means if any propagule, any spore is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to move with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say soil, I mean soil and soil
is mixed and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving anywhere that soil particles
would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's under your shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your hands are wet, it's on your wet
pruners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on your wet clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely under the bench on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any crack in the, in the concrete under
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's everywhere and you're moving it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're moving it very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: One spore rarely will, will set off an
epidemic, but there's rarely one spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, once you add a host
plant that's highly susceptible and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you add all that water because it's a
water mold, remember, then you've got that
[SPEAKER_01]: slow buildup of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly, bam, you're hit with a
disease epidemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it slowly creeps in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sanitation, sanitation, sanitation,
there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: No perfect fungicide will do a good job
without sanitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being, we don't have a good fungicide,
sanitation is all we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we, we do work with a lot of growers
that are using soils that have a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're using more biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have, I guess what you said,
like more antagonisms to Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I haven't seen a lot of
Pythium and with a lot of the grows that
[SPEAKER_00]: we work with relative to other,
other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to reuse that media,
for example, if we were growing in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a, in a bed versus a disposable media,
would repeat applications of trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that have a potential,
the potential to at least reduce it below
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic threshold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't want to say yes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, I'd rather see you steam it or
somehow sterilize it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow heat it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather see you do that with
anything in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of a hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hospital is quote unquote, sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how staff kind of takes a hold or
something else in a hospital, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens is those antagonists
are not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you've got some compost in your
media, you still don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't still have, have the
biodiversity that you have out in a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't see a lot of these
problems in fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see different things, but that's why
you really don't have a lot of these in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field because you've got really an
entire ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to create an ecosystem
in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to keep it, keep it on the
sterile end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't reuse your media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a good steamer or have
something to be able to really heat it up
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks at 110 degrees Fahrenheit would
make me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 110 degrees inside of a large
container is different than 110 on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, why can't we create a successional
functioning ecosystem in indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that compost contains higher
microbial biomass overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may contain less diversity,
but I'm just curious to hear your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's really not my area,
but think about, think about an ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: is underground at soil level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your phylosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, it's the arthropods in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's bigger and you don't
have that in an indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a biodome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, you would have to
really open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't have like a micro ecosystem
alone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a micro ecosystem,
it's happening in the bigger ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, but you can't produce a micro
ecosystem in a container or on a bench
[SPEAKER_01]: where the rest of that greenhouse doesn't
have the components needed to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've been thinking about
because we have, well, we have growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, want to do things that are
more organic and be more natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea that things that happen in
nature are somehow better than other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, even though agriculture in itself
is fairly artificial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing monocrops and harvesting them so
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I, some of the facilities
we work with, like one of them has had the
[SPEAKER_00]: same media in place and in their rooms for
over eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they've battled just about
everything at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they're able to continually
produce product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see more research around what
sorts of ecosystems, successional
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems are created in soilless media
that's being reused over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just from a sustainability perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because, you know, I could go down a
whole sustainability rabbit hole,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is so much waste that I would
like to see that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about, though, that without the full
spread of antagonists, that when something
[SPEAKER_01]: is introduced, it can just get away from
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this grower you said that's been
reusing media, that's a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice if we could say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love I would love to stick my
hands in that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's unusual for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just takes one introduction,
one introduction of a pathogen that really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of can set things off in the wrong
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're good growers and if they're
careful about what comes in, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting from seed and usually when we're
moving soil borne pathogens, we're moving
[SPEAKER_01]: them in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, soil, soil is mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you get cuttings from
someone else or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you're kind of reintroducing
versus I know like vegetable growers who
[SPEAKER_01]: only bring seed in because they have less
chance of some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seed borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about introductions in the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't introduce it, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have disease if you don't
introduce the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of my best friends is
an entomologist who I've had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand from a pathology
perspective, from an entomology
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, like you want to keep things
as clean as possible just to avoid any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this this idea of reusing media
creates a lot of a lot of a lot of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something people do
need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan outside because I'm actually I'm
really an avid grower for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's a whole I'm sure you'll
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has its other challenges from a
growing perspective.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we're not without we're not
without challenges, especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: invite a pathologist to talk about it.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just in the interest of time,
because I know we've been chatting for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But originally I'd reached out because of
some of the research you had contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of Kentucky, University of Kentucky
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you talk about a little bit about
the the silica paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you were going to ask me about the
silicon paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, if we could start with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to touch a little bit on
the other fungicide one that you did,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, even if we just spent a
couple of minutes on it, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we did a test where we used where we
applied silicon to the soilless media in
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my greenhouse with all of the
powdery mildew that I cannot get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a Gola Vinomyces spidaceus,
I think, was the was the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used three different rates of of
silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think right off hand,
like 250, 550 and 800 pounds per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did all of this in replicated
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had two different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was highly susceptible to powdery
mildew and one was moderately susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically we so we started our plugs
in in these media and then we transplanted
[SPEAKER_01]: into larger containers also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started really we set our clock when
we actually transplanted into I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the equivalent of three gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think three gallons of powdery mildew
per gallon pots, if I remember right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we grew those plants for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at we rated the amount of
powdery mildew on those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, by the way, this is will
last the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll last the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially that six hundred
kilograms per hectare, which comes out to
[SPEAKER_01]: five hundred thirty five pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what that really managed powdery
mildew to really low levels for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about what are what our
arsenal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work that needs to be
done with silicon in in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an accumulator, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother part of that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We confirmed that it was an accumulator,
but we were looking at 80 to 80 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in the amount of powdery mildew
compared to the non-treated control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, last night is a very affordable
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things I think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when last night calcium silicate,
like I said, very affordable, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: raise your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will add calcium to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to account for that in your
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to add it like I wouldn't just
add it indiscriminately to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: silica levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you guys looked at the fertility
there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We adjusted pH so that that is all in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to listeners to think about
that before they just go running out to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any is there any future research
around other types of ways of adding so
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon to soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Kentucky, we have sufficient
amounts of silicon in our soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our natural soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not something we think that would
be beneficial at the field level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely at the greenhouse level in soil
is mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know from other research in other
systems that bipolaris or cospera,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium, Septoria, or all have all been
documented, confirmed to be reduced by
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon in soil as media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are all big pathogens in hemp in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be really great if someone
would pick up that torch and run with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see that in my future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but cannabis is an accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of cannabis pathogens are known
to be reduced by silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did a whole podcast on silicon
with another with another university
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will add, if people are using
wellastonite is to make sure that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: high and heavy metals because there is a
lot of heavy metal testing now happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: being that it is a mind product,
that's another thing to account for for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see where that research
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you briefly tell me a little bit about
your other research that you did comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals and fungicides on hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that paper in particular, it was we
call it pre-screening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was all done in vitro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we we did a variety of of screening
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we did is we amended media
with different biological fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had our conventional fungicides as
our controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was that comparison?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we had another another test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put a strip of or stripe of of a
fungicide, a biological across the center
[SPEAKER_01]: of a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put plugs of our pathogens on
each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the the the premise there
is that if some of these pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: produced any kind of metabolite,
that was the antagonistic component.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the direct antagonism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was some release of some kind
of metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then our third screening method was that
we mix spores with a suspension of these
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be ones that that needed
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we did that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we plated those spores out and we
looked at germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that we don't
know about a lot of a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals is how long do they need to be
on the surface to actually work?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spray them at noon and,
you know, it dries up and whatever is in
[SPEAKER_01]: there doesn't have time to work,
whatever that mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some things we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed this pre-screening method
that we were hoping to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, there was a really wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have not just the the paper,
but we did what we call a translational
[SPEAKER_01]: piece where we kind of write the research
up for for growers who don't want all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitty gritty scientific jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a table in there that we added
that really just shows all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of experiments,
like how to best screen those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: which products seem to have the best
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is intended to be our next our
first step in what will be a series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next go to is we're going to take
select products, the ones that did the
[SPEAKER_01]: best in some of these studies,
and we're going into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we'll take the next
the next group and they'll go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: field because we can't afford to put
everything in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our research at the university is
on hemp, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody who's wondering why I keep
saying hemp, we cannot work on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the funding is just not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't just bring all of these
products into the field and test for all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these different pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to we have to have some kind of
pre-screening method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where where is our time best spent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is our money best spent?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the premise of this
pre-screening method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can look at this table and you'll
see that a lot of these products are
[SPEAKER_01]: working in a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they work in the field?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we know it's not the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our application method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our time of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I said at the very beginning of
our conversation, we don't know how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of things coming up this
year and next where we're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: teasing some of this apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it didn't suppress well in a petri
dish, is there ever a case where you might
[SPEAKER_00]: get an infield response that would be
surprising or is that a product that we
[SPEAKER_00]: may not want to necessarily use at this
point in our garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't make recommendations
necessarily, but just as a general rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is, for example, systemic
acquired resistance, you're turning on an
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system in your plant, that product
should not work in a petri dish,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does not have a direct effect
on the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant immune response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do have a couple of those in the
study and they didn't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that and we say that very clearly
in our conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to look at this study,
by the way, any of your listeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: be careful about what we're actually
saying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regalia is one like regalia didn't do well
in this study because it's not meant to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has another motive of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've picked on regalia twice today and
it's a fabulous product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not what it's meant for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is and we know we know those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have we have conversations with
these manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell us what we're what they expect
it to do and they guide us along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They developed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, a systemic acquired resistance
would be the one that we would not expect
[SPEAKER_01]: to do well in our pre-screening,
but we would definitely bring it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we haven't we didn't really
talk about SAR responses and how products
[SPEAKER_00]: might trigger that or different
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions around chitin and the chitinase
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those things affect microbes,
there's so much I would love to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know we've been talking for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could do a follow up when you
have some more research or when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some more free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you work with people in Kentucky that
are growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not available to work with just any
old person who just has a plant disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What resources does someone like myself in
Washington have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should I begin to search from a
pathology perspective to get assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: with with my product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to know where your local plant
disease diagnostic lab is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some states, you can your
university diagnostic lab will take not
[SPEAKER_01]: just hemp, but cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some state labs on the West Coast,
there are state labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may or may not also take those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some private labs out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a little bit more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to know people, though, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful where you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have an actual pathologist
and not just someone who's been who's been
[SPEAKER_01]: reading a lot of online articles and
really get a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that gets you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if there's not a reference on
that pathogen in cannabis, you can at
[SPEAKER_01]: least learn that life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about some examples today,
but knowing those life cycles and knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: overwintering and survival of a pathogen
will take you so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get to talk about environmental
conditions or humidity or temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll definitely have to do that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think I think plant diseases
is like in this sort of thing is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest challenges for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much that we don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate your time today and
sharing all this with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions,
just reach out to.
