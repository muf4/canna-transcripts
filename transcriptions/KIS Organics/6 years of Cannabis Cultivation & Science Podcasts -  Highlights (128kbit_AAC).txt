[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to share a talk that I've
given at a couple of different conferences
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a version of this talk at the
Living Soil Summit in Vegas, and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently in Melbourne, Australia at a
pharmaceutical conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast over six
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago now as a way to bridge the gap
between academic research and actual
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started the podcast,
there were very few resources for finding
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, my initial interviews were
less than scientific, but rather folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that I knew that cultivators really wanted
to hear from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the podcast evolved, I refined my
podcast to be more research based,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also included cultivators that have
been successful in the industry to share,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, their real world experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as many of you know, rarely does
grow room environment or outside growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions reach anything close to what we
would consider to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be challenges
there's always going to be compromises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my interviews are with experts who
have dedicated their lives to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific aspect of horticulture or
biology, and I consider them to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to stay open minded,
always keep learning, and ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that I think most growers would
want to know the answers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal today is not to be exhaustive
on any one topic, since I've done over 130
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes to date, but rather just give
some key takeaways and then folks can go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and find those guests and listen to
that particular podcast if they find a
[SPEAKER_00]: topic that's really interesting or they
want to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can ask questions in the comments
section below for this particular YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off, I have to pay my respects
to Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him in the ICMAG organic soil forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still on there from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest thing from all of our long
conversations and going out to dinner and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that was I learned that as a
general range, a quarter cup to a cup per
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic foot is a pretty good place to start
for most of your inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your NPK on a particular input is
higher, then you probably want to be close
[SPEAKER_00]: to that quarter cup range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a lower NPK input, then you can
probably be closer to a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot more that goes into
bounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into the details of
the balance in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a very general rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coot's also famous for popularizing the
Cornell soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That recipe is essentially a third,
a third, a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a third compost, a third peat
moss, and a third pumice or perlite or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever form of aeration that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've modified that in our mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've changed that up a little bit for a
few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because we find commercial compost to
be the biggest contaminant in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reduced that amount to closer to
15 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep the aeration around 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll add in biochar and peat
moss to make up the difference for our
[SPEAKER_00]: base mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are still running what
people call Coot's mix and doing well with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that Coot's talks about,
though, is you don't have his mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't have his earthworm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what he's saying here is
you need to formulate around your compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your compost is going to be your biggest
variable in determining your soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons that I don't
really like online soil recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone's using a different
compost source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important that you know your
compost source when you're going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it may already be high in calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to add as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it may be high in potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to add as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever nutrient we're talking about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where soil testing really comes
in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads me to my next guest,
which was Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve, I had heard of Steve before I
really got too far into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve had written Gardening West of the
Cascades, which was a really famous book
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Puget Sound in the Northwest
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came out with his new book,
The Intelligent Gardener, the idea really
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as someone who grows vegetables,
I wanted to grow the healthiest food that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really Steve's focus is how
do we get all the minerals back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in the proper ratios and at luxury
levels so that we can grow nutrient dense
[SPEAKER_00]: food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the soil is lacking in calcium,
for example, and then we're growing a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that's low in calcium, the food that we're
consuming is not going to have the calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need for our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, if we're taking that
waste and then re composting it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it back onto our soil,
we're exacerbating this issue of low
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where soil testing and soil
balancing comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we really like
to do on the cannabis side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that I want to highlight is
that Steve's soil targets and metrics are
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing nutrient dense vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not as interested in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's certainly not talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that he freely shares
and something that we've talked about a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the targets for what we call living
soil for cannabis are quite different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the targets for nutrient dense vegetables,
according to his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is Jaya Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a couple of different interviews
with Jaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya was such a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to remind folks that if you
have friends that are dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and depression and things like
that, that you reach out to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with them as best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya definitely had some demons,
but he was also one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent and unique people I've ever
met in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, Kiss wouldn't exist if it
weren't for Jaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to pay my respects there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think his interviews are actually
quite interesting, given the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them were... He was at the cutting
edge of what a lot of these things are
[SPEAKER_00]: that we take for granted now, like VPD and
biocontrols and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wasn't around in the cannabis
industry when he started talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of hear that in some of
my initial podcasts with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that Jaya talks about,
though, and I think is important to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight is that canopy determines your
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you grow one plant and veg it
for a long time to fill a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: space, or we put nine plants in that same
space, if the canopies are approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: equal, your yield is going to be
approximately equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All other conditions the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something to think
about when you're planting out your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on if you have number
limitations based on the regulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that Jaya came up with was
this... Initially, it was sort of an 80 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 M bar for Kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good starting number for most
people growing in peat-based living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've since modified this closer to 80 to
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be a little bit wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the number, the wetter the soil
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some guys going as low as 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people are going 60 to 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really important to try it out in
your media and see what works best in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing that Jaya figured
out was that communal planting has
[SPEAKER_00]: increased yield benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met Jaya one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was literally mixing soils in my parents
driveway when we had the compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stopped by to get some pot compost
tea ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave him some of the soil I was
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try this out with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even growing cannabis at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back a couple of months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really was super interested in the
soil because that soil with just water
[SPEAKER_00]: outperformed his program that he was
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was running Biobiz or one of
the botanic air bottled nutrients at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, some organic line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then he started experimenting with
this soil and growing in seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took all those pots and put them in
a flood tray, kind of all mashed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he noticed that the roots were
starting to grow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, why not just put them
all in the flood tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, he just filled the flood
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he realized the soil depth wasn't
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he increased the depth and started
growing in essentially a raised bed with
[SPEAKER_00]: pond liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the most successful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for those of you that grew up in
states where it may not have been legal to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, it was the sketchiest thing trying
to move soil out of your garage or out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 3 o'clock in the morning, trying to do
that was always sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could reuse the soil and just
bring in nutrients to replace what was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken out by the plant, that was going to
reduce risk and reduce labor and make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've since modified this process to
commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really where it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, moving on to the bug lady,
Suzanne Wainwright Evans, dear,
[SPEAKER_00]: dear friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the best entomologist, infield
entomologist I'm aware of in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, maybe in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really knows her pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the stuff that she's taught me
through our conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done multiple podcasts with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly suggest you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one, it always begins with a
positive ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what the pest is because
they can have different life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without understanding the pest,
you really can't begin to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: program for treating or managing the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the other things that she
highlights that I think is important to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize is that pests cannot develop a
resistance to being eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because when we apply
chemical fertilizers over time or even
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fertilizers, pests can develop a
resistance to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they survive due to that
resistance, they're going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to future applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we change our modes of
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not constantly using the same
pesticide over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we use beneficial insects,
that's not a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're working 24-7 for you in your
room, getting to all the places that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have reached with your sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing in the right beneficials at
the right time in the grow is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one is one that most people
know, but I just want to throw it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there as a reminder, because when I first
started spraying my plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, like an oil-based spray,
for example, and pesticides don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also talking about things like neem
oil, horticultural oils, sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, all of these things that we use
in the organic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to apply them at the label
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking, OK, I'm going to be
ecologically friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to apply my pesticide at the
lowest rate I can because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be spraying pesticides anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the problem with that is when you
apply a pesticide at below the label rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're allowing that plant to develop a
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that issue that I just talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always important to apply at label
rates, because those label rates are
[SPEAKER_00]: established to give you the maximum
killing effect with the minimum risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always want to follow the label
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll usually give you a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could stay at the lower end of the
range, depending on how much pest pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's always a good idea to make sure
to follow those label rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those label rates, if it's an
EPA-registered product, are the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to follow them, especially if
you're a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always make sure to wear the proper
PPE as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that she mentions I think
is important to bring up is that it's best
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply beneficials early when the plant
canopy is smaller, when your application
[SPEAKER_00]: rates are lower, and before we get too far
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you get into flower,
not only can you not really spray anything
[SPEAKER_00]: once pistol development has started,
but it's also too late if you have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see webbing, for example,
from two-spot spider mites, late in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, you could apply beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably too late in the game at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a great preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a couple of preventative or
maintenance sprays and then bring in my
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials after I've done a couple
rounds of sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's sort of my beginning IPM
in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always use the beneficials as soon as
you can in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, Suzanne, there's a ton of
bad information online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people getting recommendations for
their IPM program from Facebook or
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to have an entomologist in
your corner or reach out to someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: has access to an entomologist to make sure
that you're getting accurate information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a commercial facility,
I talked to Suzanne about this multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had this conversation with her this
week where she went and visited a facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that was working with a different
consultant who was a rep for a insectary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, they were having them over
apply the beneficials and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying too many products to where her
visit was paid for within a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from what they were spreading on
pesticides and beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: because their program was not optimized
from a cost perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a commercial facility and you
have a robust IPM program, it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: good to have a professional like Suzanne
look it over and make sure that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: overspending too, because people do go
that route as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, please don't buy
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something I thought was ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logically friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they're wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole podcast on ladybugs and why
you don't want to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty interesting if you
want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread disease to native populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let them go outside,
they're probably just going to fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more thing to think about when we
talk about beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is Ben Hartman.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a book that I think everybody
should read.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I owned a commercial facility,
I would make all of my cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: even all my processors and everyone that
worked for me read this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about minimizing waste and
maximizing efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all based off of the whole Toyota
concept of lean manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben did a great job of converting it into
a mental model that works for farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really it works for all aspects of
your lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea is to reduce muda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And muda is waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And waste can be wasted food that you
didn't get processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be waste in the form of a pile of
stuff in the corner of your room that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be waste in the form of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had a farm, I would spend time if I
wanted to start a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take me 20 minutes to get all the
tools I needed to start the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd think, well, shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I get all the tools together,
I'm not even going to have time to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last waste is this mental
waste, this idea that we have things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are constantly in the back of our head
that we know we need to do and we just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seem to be getting around to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a form of muda as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way to just be a more
efficient grower and more efficient with
[SPEAKER_00]: your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about getting the right tools in
the right location to save time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will add just a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over at Gold Leaf Gardens, Nate over there
had all his guys read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so funny because one of them
was coming up to me, Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yo, I've been getting into
this whole lean farming thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My toilet paper, we were keeping it in the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I keep it in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I need it, when I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just funny how we can incorporate
these things into our lives to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient with our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Yoram Kapulnik.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's with the Volkani Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the creators of Dino Myco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really changed my mind about how I
felt about my mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he talked about is, and I think
this is important to keep in mind for all
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms, whether it's mycorrhizal
fungi or Bavaria, Trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say these, these are sort of think
of them more like categories in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not all the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the Israeli Dino Myco
comes from a very arid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has very good drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle a wider range of
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about those abiotic
conditions, maybe then some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, there aren't that many
mycorrhizal manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are coming from just a few
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Bavaria, for example,
if that particular Bavaria species was
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered on, say, like a grass hopper,
that particular Bavaria product may have
[SPEAKER_00]: better efficacy with grasshoppers,
but it may not have as good of efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: with, say, another species of insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that all Bavaria is going to
perform the same is not is not very
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to try out a few different
ones and find out what gives you the best
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just to further complicate all of
that, we found that some companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: some quite popular companies here in the
organic living soil space, are selling
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria that doesn't even have a spore
count high enough to allow for any level
[SPEAKER_00]: of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need to know where you're
getting your product and know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: product is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just wasting your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this because one of my
pathologist friends purchased it,
[SPEAKER_00]: tested it, and looked at the spore
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the flip side, there's another
company not in the living soil space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but out there that's selling Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their claims for spore counts are
higher than would physically be possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to fit into that volume of a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just not even possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important to look for a good
source when we talk about buying micro
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing that I wasn't
really aware of was that mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and trichoderma can be symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of products have them in there
together, but trichoderma can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they found is that the certain
species can work quite well with
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to do a mycorrhizal
application early on when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant a rooted cutting, for example,
or have a seedling, then you could follow
[SPEAKER_00]: that up a few weeks later with a
trichoderma application, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: Root Shield, and that would be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other note that I wanted to add here
is that, and I'll talk about this more in
[SPEAKER_00]: my heavy metals talk, but there is
research that shows that mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: increases the uptake of heavy metals,
along with all these other beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizal fungi has a ton of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend checking out the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, too, that if you're in a
state where you're regulated for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, you may want to just be careful
and think about using this because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Marshall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don is a dear friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He established the horticultural college
at Lake Washington and he or the program
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and he ran it for like 30 or 40
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back to school just to take his
botany program prior to him retiring the
[SPEAKER_00]: last year before he retired because he is
the best educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful to know him, and I'm
working on putting together a botany
[SPEAKER_00]: class, an online botany class for folks so
that people can take his course online
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things Don talks about in
his podcast I did with him, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this is interesting, and this is where
it's important to understand the mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: behind why plants do the things that they
do or what the mechanism of action is from
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant physiology perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's all about, in this case,
root hair death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So root hair is where nutrient and water
uptake occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are over-watering,
you're going to be killing root hairs and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially creating an environment that's
going to be better for pathogen growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're under-watering, you're also
going to be killing root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these root hairs will regrow,
but they will both give you a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground display in terms of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they both cause a reduction in
nutrient uptake due to this root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: death, which I think is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people look at a wilting plant and
they just say, oh, that's under-watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, it could be massively
over-watered because they're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: same symptomatic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding why I think is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Don highlights
is you need to be a detective in your
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to do this first thing in the
morning, not at the end of the day after
[SPEAKER_00]: you've talked to 100 people and made a
million decisions and you're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right when you first go to your
greenhouse or to go see your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to look around the room and see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my limiting factor of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's fertility, but people
always assume it's fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could very well be your irrigation,
the way you're watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you need to do is always be
thinking about what the limiting factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is, because there's always
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just need to keep checking those
off and checking those off and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: improving things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reason, for example,
to go buy a hype ferment or biological
[SPEAKER_00]: product if my limiting factor of growth is
light or the way I'm watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do find that one of those
products makes a difference, then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go backwards and figure out why it made
a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it addressing in terms of
nutrients, in terms of biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of whatever aspect was limiting
your plants growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just always good to be a plant
detective in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I always think
about now when I approach plants in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee Brees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee does not work in cannabis either.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a plant doctor, independent crop
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, he's a doctorate in plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really loved his perspective and
approach to plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he loves soil testing, but he does it
primarily to support what he's already
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, feeling, and smelling in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you can scoop up a handful of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell those actinobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what healthy soil smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel the tilt of the soil,
what levels of sand, silt, and clay are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see with your eyes visually how
the plant is responding to the fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil testing is really there to
support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't rely solely on soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be some checks and
balances between the soil testing and how
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
that soil test really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters is our plants and how they're
responding to whatever fertility we're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that Lee talks
about that I think is important is this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that egg is not a natural system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear people say, well, no one's
putting Miracle Grow out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest, yet we're able to grow these
healthy, happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would Mother Nature do?
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of biomimicry and imitating what
nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mother Nature doesn't have weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature has pests, what we would
call pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out and look around your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that there's insect damage on
pretty much all your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's checks and balances there to keep
things in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what causes those checks and balances
is the level of diversity and ecology that
[SPEAKER_00]: is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about growing a
particular crop, which means growing one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant primarily to the exclusion of pretty
much all others, it's not a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we can use what nature does,
we want to look at it from the perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fact that it's not a natural
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to make a difference in the
health of our crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those practices like bringing
in organic matter, mulching, cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping, those things make a lot of sense
in an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors where we can control every aspect
of a plant's growth or health,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very much not a natural system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to keep that in mind when
we're making decisions about our growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought he did a good job speaking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon works for KISS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does all the agronomy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been growing now for,
oh, shoot, almost 40 years, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a ton of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's grown with salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he only grows organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just has a ton of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ran a commercial hemp facility for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that Brandon
really talks about and explains so well is
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea of a dichotomous key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put together an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the KISS website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out under the blog page
under Learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what it is, it's a mental
checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this idea that Dawn talked about
about being a plant detective,
[SPEAKER_00]: all laid out for you with mental mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is your problem biotic or abiotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it caused by temperature or sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is your problem caused by an insect or
a pest, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he explains all the different
deficiencies that you may see from a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient perspective and then how we can
address these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have him on the podcast talking
about the dichotomous key as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things he talks about is
just following the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the more curious people that
I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's always challenged me in that
regard to keep on learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just did a podcast with Mr.
Growett recently talking about myths
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabis industry, stuff like
white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about the science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we always look to science first
rather than what we see on social media or
[SPEAKER_00]: what influencers may be telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the things that Brandon is
really good at is pathogen prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does this by not skimping out on
his spray routine by keeping his space
[SPEAKER_00]: very clean and staying ahead of the game
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to be a little bit more of a lazy
grower, and I'm not as good about this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows here in the Northwest,
you have to stay ahead of things with
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays, microbial sprays, for example,
if you want to prevent powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to prevent protritus on your
outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brandon's really good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staying to a schedule, journaling what
he's doing every time he goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room so he has notes and then making
sure to stay ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to think about in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I'm recording this talk,
I just recently published a podcast with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nicole Gauthier, and she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's at the University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the latest podcast has so many gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based off of her first podcast
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things she talks about is
there's very few cannabis pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: are easily identifiable from images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to send them off to a
pathologist to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like with insects, so you can come
up with a proper plan of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently here in the Northwest,
I get this, it looks like powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of white covering on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not visible when in the morning dew,
but after the dew dries, you'll see these
[SPEAKER_00]: splotches of white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it looks like PM on different
places all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at it under the dino light
with a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent it off to Dr. Gauthier,
and I can't wait to hear her tell me what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can think it might be is
something related to leaf hoppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that seems to be the one thing
that's vectoring across these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, it's only on my auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on my photo period plants,
but I've seen it on them in previous
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to get it identified so I
can know how to treat it or even know if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something I need to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things she shares is that
there's actually two species of powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew that can infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one can survive and thrive at a 40%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know what you're
dealing with so that you can treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I say this is because
traditionally, we would say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I need to drop my humidity down to a
level that PM can't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at 40%, not only are you stressing
your plant, but in the case of this one
[SPEAKER_00]: species of PM, it actually can do quite
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also that these powdery mildew
species can have a wide host range,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that they can display differently
on different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that powdery mildew on your squash is
actually probably the same PM that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with your cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know that because I'd
always thought, oh, there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different species of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on one plant is probably not the
one affecting my other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not totally the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these have pretty wide host
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things she mentions is that
cucurbits tend to have the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PM has cannabis, and that's something
she mentioned in the latest podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was new information to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to be more careful in the
future with my pumpkins, my squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: my cucumbers and keeping them away from
any cannabis crops to make sure I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get PM transferring across or
staying ahead of the game with my spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: on those plants, because traditionally I
will always get PM on my squash plants
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rather inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just always a good
reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever I go to a new facility,
I always like to pop a plant out of a pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically in veg and just take a look at
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have white, healthy roots with
good root hairs or are the roots brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: slimy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant girdling at all because they
haven't transplanted in a proper amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is that Pythium is
pretty easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically only an issue on young
plants and they can outgrow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are things that we can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things that we can identify
visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bruce Bugbee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this podcast, I didn't do a podcast
with him, but some of this I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: share is new information that came from a
podcast he did with Migro recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things is we've known that
cannabis is a highlight plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to corn, but it can handle levels
even higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the recent trials that he did,
upwards of 2300 PPFD with yields
[SPEAKER_00]: continually increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to take that with a caveat
because there are some lighting companies
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are pushing more light,
more light, more light, which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because it's not good for our
environment in terms of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy that we're using and having to
create, but also because from an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, those yields may be slightly
higher, but they're not increasing at a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yields go down as the light goes
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the economic threshold where we want to
be is around 1200 to 1300 PPFD when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing CO2 at 1200 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tend to go even a little bit
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower than this, because you have to
remember this isn't Bruce growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a typical facility situation
with living soil where we have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: variables going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would tend to aim for 1000 to 1100
initially, and then you can always ramp
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are running CO2, you do want to
run higher PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you aren't able to run CO2,
let's say you have a home grow and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just not feasible, then 800 to 1000 PPFD
is optimal when you're not supplementing
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And young plants can handle highlight too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something new that I haven't had a
chance to really play around with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he claims 1000 PPFD in veg is fine
with CO2 supplementation and will cut veg
[SPEAKER_00]: times down substantially, meaning we'll
get a lot more growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would caution people to work their way
up to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't just throw plants under 1000
PPFD in veg, but I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely worth exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a side note, if you are interested in
lighting at all, I've been working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful company that's a NASA spinoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their company name is BIOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is BIOS Lighting, and I work
with them with a lot of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you need one light or 500
lights, we've worked with people on both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful light with a seven year
warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the price, it's the best light
in the industry, and it's what I use over
[SPEAKER_00]: in my grow, in my house, and I'm very
happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just want to throw that out there for
anyone looking for lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant is another good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things that he talks
about, I've done multiple lives with him
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out as well as interviews
for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we both agree on is
that pH matters in organics and living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, with organics and living
soils, the pH will tend to fall into a
[SPEAKER_00]: range that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say six, six to seven, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can get that pH dialed in into a
good range, the plant's going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to put more of its energy into other
things rather than pH management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we always want to start
with getting our pH into optimal ranges
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And too low of a pH, frankly, can really
increase your heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that Bryant talks about,
and Steve Solomon has talked about this as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, is that gypsum has a very low
solubility rating and a very low salt
[SPEAKER_00]: index because of that soluble rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use a lot of it with very
little risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's calcium sulfate, so it's giving you
calcium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really impacting pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's one amendment that I think you
can be very heavy-handed with and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with because typically,
if we don't get enough calcium into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant early on in the plant's life and
throughout all the way through flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to impact a variety of plant
physiological functions and impact our
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and plant health dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that Bryant talks about is
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's research that shows that
maximum nitrogen use efficiency occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: when plants use various forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we want to try and think
about not just using one source for our
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen but multiple sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you incorporate carbon-based
nitrogen, it increases nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's talking about there is
things like anything with a meal at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of it, so feather meal, fish meal,
blood meal, all of those come with that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon component in there, which will,
again, increase that efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the advantages we have as
organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of hype around
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear a lot of people say you need
aminos, and they're typically derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that Bryant points out is that
all organic products, when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: these different meals, feather meal,
fish meal, whatever, are either composed
[SPEAKER_00]: of or end up as amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fish meal, for example, is quite high
in protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the process of mineralization,
we're getting those amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's on the fence as to whether or not
we need to purchase directly amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: products or if we can just continue to use
these amendments because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be mineralized into an amino acid form
through the organic process, anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: through nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Wendy Zellner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, along with Dr. Goche, probably my
two favorite podcasts at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon is such a fascinating element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly abundant and has a ton of
different plant benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mitigates plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces mineral uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study actually done by Dr.
Nicole Goche, the pathologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: that found a 70% reduction in powdery
mildew using molastinite, which is calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases your heat and drought
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces salt stress, enhances UV
tolerance, and reduces sodium and chloride
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is that miracle drug,
that miracle fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one thing that meets all of those
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly enough, when we talk
about hyperaccumulators like cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, for example, if soils have
insufficient levels of silicon,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the plant will uptake arsenic through
that same pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SI availability varies dramatically
based on your parent material and source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of the order from most
available to least available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an amorphous form would be something
like potassium silicate, that eggsil-16H.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we sell a pound of it for like 20
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to make up a gallon of
liquid potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's in most of those silica
products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to add the water yourself and save
a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the best forms of SI
from an availability perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then biogenic would be plant-based
sources of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things, you know, silica derived from
bamboo, for example, would fall under that
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be the next most available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though you do have to be careful with the
potential for heavy metals, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: with rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to use rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that can be quite high in arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be careful of your
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly is crystalline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's silicon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things like salt or quartz,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not salt, sorry, sand or quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that crystalline form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are going to be available more
on a period of weeks to months to years
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably are not even going to be
available that first or second cycle even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're adding silica sand,
keep in mind that these products are
[SPEAKER_00]: really rarely unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One exception to this would be
diatomaceous earth, according to Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zellner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be fairly available to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've done some research with that,
which I think is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this chart here that she shared
with us is a good way to compare SI
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can convert them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually are comparing apples to
apples because it is quite confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these different forms of SI
will offer different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of actual silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are applying it,
she recommends 30 to 60 ppm weekly or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 40 ppm on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys checking it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have questions, comment below
and I'll do my best to answer them or send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email at Tad at kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate you guys checking
out and supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a Patreon channel for anyone
that is interested that allows you access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately after I record them,
you get the raw interviews with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do monthly hangouts where we share
our grows and talk and talk with other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers about what's going on,
not just in our grows, but in our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also do a book club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're working our way through
teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already did the intelligent gardener
and we have a few more books.
[SPEAKER_00]: On deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then we also have a private
discord channel and some other stuff going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like the podcast and you want to
support it, it's a really easy way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's as low as five bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out and get access to all
that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
Thank you.
