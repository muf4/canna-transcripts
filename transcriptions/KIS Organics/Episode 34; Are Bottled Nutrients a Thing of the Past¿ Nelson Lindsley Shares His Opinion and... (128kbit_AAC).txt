[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Nelson Lindsley of
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check him out on Instagram under
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson has been cultivating cannabis for
over a decade and working in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for over two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last three years, he has
consulted on cultivation sites in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Oregon, Colorado,
Pennsylvania, and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson has been on the podcast before and
is a popular guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get him back on here to talk
about an upcoming project we are working
[SPEAKER_00]: on, as well as cover a range of topics
ranging from bottled nutrients to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to have you back on the
show to talk about, well, a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off telling listeners a
little bit about our new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell them about the Dope History
podcast and what that really is all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dope History podcast is going to be a
collection of narratives from individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been in the cannabis community
and cannabis world for the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, 30, 40 years, all-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is highlighting
particular journeys and narratives of
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals that have built the foundation
for the cannabis market that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nelson and I will be co-hosting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be called the Dope History
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to dopehistory.com to check it
out and I'll have all the information
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out with links on the podcast page
for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is purely a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we're both really
excited about doing together as a project,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to share some of these really,
really amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hope is people, while they're
working in their room or sitting back,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a joint, they can just hear some of
the history around this plant and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that people have gone through
to get us to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there was a campfire, it would be
perfect, but we can't do that digitally,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something, something to chill,
listen to, and kind of understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone through with this plant and our
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the laws and the way,
you know, some people have given up so
[SPEAKER_00]: much or gained so much by cultivating or
transporting or being related to this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant somehow spiritually connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have stories on there from like
guys that were kicking it in the seventies
[SPEAKER_01]: and eighties and some pretty amazing
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the history of, you know,
the psychedelic movement even,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and where all that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's not give it all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have to check out the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into this podcast though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to have you back on and thanks
for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to think of topics cause you
and I have conversations all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just ramble on and they all seem
pretty interesting to me, but I was trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to think what, what could we focus on
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one question I wanted to ask you was,
do you think bottled nutrients are still
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they something, you know, within the
cannabis industry that are maybe a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a dinosaur in some respects, or do you
think that they're improving and really
[SPEAKER_00]: are the future of cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're the, I'm going to throw a curve
ball and I'm going to say maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say that because number
one, I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, I'm learning more about the
formulations and what I'm, so if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, we'll talk about the
synthetic type fertilizers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's two, it's almost two different
worlds for organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what would you, well,
side note is the fish hydrolysis
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a bottled nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a, it's not a, you're not buying
a brand though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying a, a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say no, that would be like
saying, you know, ammonium nitrate is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we're talking about a
delivery system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause is it, is it, and if we're talking
about a delivery system, we're saying a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottled nutrient is the fertilizer mixed
with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've created, you know,
a lot of people, well, we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, buying water, shipping water
doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, economically or operationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've learned is that with
synthetic nutrients, if you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be super anal and exact about your
percentages, sometimes you have to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: premixed by an actual chemist to get it a
hundred percent accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that needed for production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, some people think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want it to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've learned when you're scooping
out your water soluble blends,
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of fertilizers, that every single one
of those minerals has its own specific
[SPEAKER_01]: weight and how that bag of fertilizer is
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're scooping it into your
reservoir, you may or may not be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual correct combination of minerals
that you think you are based on how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: scooping and how you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the little caveat to all
of it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's being blended for you
beforehand, you know exactly how much
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, how much magnesium, how much
iron, and that's all done by weight by the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemist into the bottled nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do not think that most bottled
fertilizer companies, cannabis fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are, I mean, I might get in
trouble for saying this, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're really going to that level of
detail when they're making their
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers just because I've run tests on
it and I've, you know, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: name any names and we've talked about this
before, but I've seen wide variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: wide ranges of differences in the minimum
and maximums of the fertilizer levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are those products, those perfected
bottled nutrient products out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's some companies that
are working on getting better at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, I would still lean more
towards the water soluble fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: although there are some associates of mine
who are having their fertilizers mixed by
[SPEAKER_01]: some specialists and are working on
creating, you know, the perfect cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is our bottled nutrients dead?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in this current iteration,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's room for something else to
come out of it, but I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make sense at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a bit of a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been a pretty loud critic of
bottled nutrients in general for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while now, trying to get growers to just
read the label and then look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and sort of formulate their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that being said, when we talk about
synthetic nutrients and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects, yes, we do need to continually
feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, we can't expect all of our
nutrients to be in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even as someone who sells
living soils and water only soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think there is benefit to continual
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the plant will actually
thrive and do a little bit better if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to give it a little bit of
nutrients throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I think we give
bottled nutrient companies way too much
[SPEAKER_00]: credit in terms of, you know, QC and
quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the innovation that went into the
products that they're creating,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot more money and time probably
went into their branding than it did into
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual formulation of the product in a
lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to say one thing about just a
little side note.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally had the opportunity now that
I moved out of LA to grow some plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, for my indoor plants, I still use
the synthetic blend and I add my organics
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside, I do not use any bottled
nutrients at all anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I've used some of your soil,
which has been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make a mended soil and I just
feed it water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have gotten to the point where it's
so much easier just to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the product that comes out in the
health of the plant is better than 90% of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so very little that I have to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to, you know, have a nice soil
blend that has the right proper fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I talked to Coot the other
day and Coot turned me on to a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: little things I can add into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just been amazing to see what you
can do without having to go to a synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would more, you know, say that I'm
moving into this place where the
[SPEAKER_01]: al-natural, sun-grown, there's just a joy
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, you know, I don't have to be
screwing around pH meters, EC meters and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just easier and I have less
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that different under the sun and
the light, indoor light, artificial light?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just has to do with the power
of the way this planet was built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little side note on that,
because I don't think we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that I've been moving away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I am almost looking at indoor
cultivation now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of indoor
cultivation, but I'm almost looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation as more of an R&D space
and less of a space for commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: production, just because how much easier
it is to be growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that makes sense where you're
located down in California, but up here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, especially in Western
Washington near Seattle, we just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, you're rolling the dice as to
whether or not your plants will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: finish depending on how the weather is
come October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, maybe moving towards,
you know, auto flowers is a solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, outdoor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does bring up other challenges like the
weather and you don't have the same levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of control, but you do get all the benefit
of unlimited root space and beneficial and
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory insects just naturalizing in
your environment and sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a ton of benefits to it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still putting the plants in pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, forgive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still making my own soil,
you know, working on the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten some hemp plants in the ground
and that's been going well, but still I
[SPEAKER_01]: still am leaning towards growing cannabis
in pots so I can control the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that are actually in the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm, I'm the total opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put a plant in the ground 99% of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only times I don't recommend going
into the ground are if you have really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: moles and folds or things that are going
to eat the roots and kill your plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in a floodplain where your
water table is so high that it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from coming from a nursery background,
growing up on a plant nursery with my
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, you take two plants and you put
one plant in a container and you put one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the ground soil is somewhat
subpar, that plant in the ground is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to outperform the plant in the container
99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of the reasons I just listed,
you know, I would love to see you do an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't even have to do a soil
test of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know a lot about your
soil, but my guess is if you put one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and put that same, you know,
another clone in good soil, shoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in our soil and run them side by
side and see how it compares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that, that makes all the sense in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just, what, that just has to do
with the amount that the roots can grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limitating factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root space isn't like you said,
isn't a limiting factor in the fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the soil typically has, you know,
pretty good microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have, um, it's going to
have more soil structure and there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot we don't know, honestly
going on there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you know, like I have
mulberry trees at my farm and I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: in containers that have, you know,
been root bound now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are probably two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the same mulberry tree in the
chicken yard that is now 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is because we haven't up
potted our mulberries appropriately to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the size they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it too, is once we put that
plant into the ground, it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watering is another thing there too,
because when you're in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't, you don't need to water as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of have a natural mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's able to pull up water out of
the soil a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More efficiently than it can out of
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a, even a clone, cause the clone is
lacking a tap root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All everything I'm saying is under the
caveat that once the, once the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we're talking about sort of
random things, I kind of wanted to change
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you posted on your
Instagram a while back related to flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and organically flushing organic
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to kind of summarize how that
discussion went and sort of what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think we have a similar view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, all everyone's been
flushing cannabis that I know for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: seven to 14 days of the life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So prior to harvest practices to deprive
the plant of nutrients and just give it
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thought behind that was that it
created a better quality product because
[SPEAKER_01]: you were flushing out the nutrients out of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear, you know, I'll go online and I
see a lot of people talking about that and
[SPEAKER_01]: it just didn't make, it didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't understand how you could,
how pouring water into the plant would
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that it was being described and
talked about seemed to be incorrect to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put a couple posts up,
actually was a repost for another guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a very excellent description of what
actually was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suggested that we stopped calling it
flushing the plant and started calling it
[SPEAKER_01]: starving the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, removing the
fertilizer, you know, then you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: various things that happen and the plant
starts using its stores of energy and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you start getting nutrient
deficiencies essentially is what it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what it really looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that deficiency, there's,
I think there's a stress response that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens that may increase the cannabinoid
content and terpene content as a defense
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism or as the death throes of the
plant as it's realizing it's not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: any more food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, kind of ended at the end
of its reproductive cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's actually creating the
increase in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talk about having a taste,
you know, that if you don't flush that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a poor tasting product
on the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's the direct
result of it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: People discuss about chlorophyll,
like you're flushing out the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seemed like there was a
scientific, an unscientific practice being
[SPEAKER_01]: put in a place and being claimed as a
scientific practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I understand everything that's going on
when we flush the plant at this moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm still learning and figuring all of
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I, you know, go talk to other,
you know, PhDs and people that know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more about horticulture than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk to them about this flushing the
plant thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of chuckle and laugh and
say, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never even heard of that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to explain to them what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to decipher what the
common understanding of it is to what's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hasn't been a ton of research
done on flushing the plant just because
[SPEAKER_01]: there aren't a lot of other industries
that do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't a lot of agricultural crops
where they're actually flushing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing I will say on that is
cannabis is an amazing bioaccumulator of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals and minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps, giving it that water allows
the cannabis plant to release something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they bioaccumulated that could affect
the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the only thing that I could
think of that would support this quote
[SPEAKER_01]: unquote flushing terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing, especially in,
you know, when you're growing with mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: salts is you can have a buildup of salt
content in your media and you can also
[SPEAKER_00]: have excess nitrates in your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that by removing those,
by flushing the plant or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: removing them out of the media by adding
excessive water, you can improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a few things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in organic soil, you don't have a
bunch of ionic nutrients just hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you typically don't have a buildup of
salt content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really make sense to flush
your plant for the same reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no excess nitrates to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, does, as you said,
you know, starving or stressing your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: create a stress response that's somehow
going to improve the quality of the final
[SPEAKER_00]: bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe, but I've, you know,
I've seen a lot of great organic growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't flush their plants that have
produced really, really good, high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, you know, what I would consider
top shelf cannabis and top shelf flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, flushing is a bit of a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we want to start looking at
creating stress responses in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at various stages of growth and how
that may affect, you know, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: levels or terpene content in the plant
itself, I think that is something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could study using science and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that flushing is really
the right, like you said, the right
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology or really what's what we what
we want to do with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would challenge people to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing an organic soil,
go ahead and try flushing one plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: see compare the final the final flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you'll see an
improvement personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's my take.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you flush an organic and organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not really when you're
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about feeding the plant
organic inputs through a solution or an
[SPEAKER_01]: organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I have an organic soil,
I'm very rarely feeding it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of fertilizer solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of its kind of already they're mixed
into the soil or top trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you how would you flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you flush an organic plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can get the if you have like a
pretty fairly inert low ECC substrate and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're trying to flush out or purge
those nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't understand how that affects
the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how that works when
people make those claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how would you flush an organic plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so here's the argument, as I
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to take a media,
a soilless media that is potentially high
[SPEAKER_00]: in nitrates and you remove those nitrates
by adding a lot of water, that plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have less nitrogen to take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it's going to have less
chlorophyll production and therefore it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have less green, less green in
its leaves and potentially maybe have less
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll overall when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that would be my take on that from
an organic soil perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's amendments being added or
ingredients in terms of nitrogen that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not in a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has to be processed by the
microbiology in the soil into nitrate or
[SPEAKER_00]: into ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially that may be some of that
may be washed out through a flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: process, but it's not an excessive level
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from a farming perspective and
agriculturally, you always add nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring because of the heavy rains that
you get will flush it out of your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't even test for nitrogen and a
lot of times on the soil tests because
[SPEAKER_00]: they just assume that your soil is going
to be deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's when we're talking about
agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we talk about soilless media indoors
where we're not getting that excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: water addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could potentially have too much
nitrogen or too many nitrogen amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a balance there, I guess,
but it's not something that I think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting with the last week or 14 days
of your plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you need to be
managing throughout the entire growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle as you sort of balance and manage
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll use flushing if my,
if let's say I have too much of a dry down
[SPEAKER_01]: period on my medium, the EC is going to
climb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might not be suitable for
whatever stage of growth the plant's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be times if I made a boo-boo
or I made a mistake and I've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use flushing to clean out the medium
and kind of reset the medium for proper
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll still flush with a small amount
of fertilizer because I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: starve the plant in the middle of its
cycle just to kind of get it back into
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will use that practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end, you know, at the end of
the cycle, I mean, I've done, I've done it
[SPEAKER_01]: where I flushed it for, I mean,
I've flushed, I've flushed a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, thinking that this is what
you're supposed to do and that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create quality flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about two years ago, I started to
slowly bring down the amount of days that
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give it water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know what, I'm going to
cut this down when it's ready and I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to starve it until I think it's
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm at a point now where I'll give it
water for two or three days and cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't notice, and no one else who
uses the flower notices that it tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: funny or has too much of, you know,
some residual something or other in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the taste issue has more
to do with properly drying the product and
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing it to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is what I, you know, in the ash burning,
you know, a lot of people say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the ash is burning black.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it wasn't flushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't, that doesn't make any sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the ash is burning black, it's either
too, too wet or there's some other
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical that was sprayed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thought on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a cannabis consumption expert,
so I'm going to not weigh in on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard, have you heard that
conversation before?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have, but I don't have enough
experience, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know Coot, for example,
will tell you that anything that was grown
[SPEAKER_00]: with chemicals to him tastes like a burned
up rubber tire and he can just tell right
[SPEAKER_00]: away if it was grown using mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't claim to have any level of
sophistication around, well, frankly
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, wine or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I wish I had a better palette,
I just, I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stay out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I did want to bring up
relating to flushing before we move on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next topic is some of the concerns
around it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we stress our plant, we may get a
good stress response, but we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: opening it up to more pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing the humidity in our rooms
potentially, which can lead to more
[SPEAKER_00]: chance, you know, more opportunity for
certain fungal pathogens like botrytis or
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the dangers,
I guess, or concerns around excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: watering or any sort of, any sort of
practice that's going to create a stress
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that you would
be watering more often if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to, you know, drown the
roots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that your latent load,
which is the amount of water that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air or the water that's being transpired
by the plant should go up, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing or giving it just a regular
solution for the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that any stress response at
the end of a cycle, if you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: unstable genetic, could cause the plant to
hermaphrodite, which is what I see often
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is flushing the plant cause the plant
to hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that we have a lot of unstable
genetics on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one faux pas can create
banana pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, yeah, I would suggest everyone
do a trial, like you said, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever methodology they're using,
try flushing on one or two plants and try
[SPEAKER_01]: not flushing on one or two plants and
really give it a fair, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: blind taste test or an analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that you mentioned a little
bit ago when we were talking about outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants was not using your EC or pH meter
anymore on your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a recent discussion online
about whether or not you need to ever pH
[SPEAKER_00]: your water if you're growing organically
or with organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a pretty strong opinion on
this, but I was going to let you go first
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's any, you have any thoughts on
the subject or I'm happy to chime in and
[SPEAKER_00]: start the discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the first thing you need to
do is check your, before you're feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants any of your water,
you need to check, you know, get a water
[SPEAKER_01]: test done and make sure that it's suitable
for plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I lived in LA for a while and
sometimes the pH was all over the map and
[SPEAKER_01]: not within that suitable for growth range,
which, you know, from how I understand it
[SPEAKER_01]: is somewhere between, you know,
five five and seven five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's around there, I don't know if
it's that important because the soil will
[SPEAKER_01]: do a lot of the pH buffering for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, indoors it's a little bit
more, it's a little trickier when you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're dealing with the
soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you do have to pay
attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for, and I don't know how you feel
about it, so we haven't talked about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've been having great results after
checking my water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around six eight to seven two,
kind of where it comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't really made any pH
adjustments and I don't notice any
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient deficiencies in the plant,
but I haven't gotten this leaf tissue test
[SPEAKER_01]: done on my outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just basing it off of what I can
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have pretty perfect water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that to me, six eight is pretty
damn good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I was hearing is people have
water as high as eight or eight one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, you know, people are saying,
no, don't worry about pH in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the soil contains
sufficient, if it has good microorganism
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and diversity, it will buffer the
pH for the plant in the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, soil does have much higher
buffering capacity, but I don't think it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to talk about optimal plant
health and plant growth, we want water to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to be watering with things that
are within optimal pH ranges too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we get to throw the pH pen
completely out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to still know what we're starting
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that, well,
we were getting into an argument with
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys because they didn't,
we didn't agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since this is my podcast, I get to
share my opinion, which is we do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the pH of our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always need to start off knowing,
you know, what's in your media,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in your water, because you can't
develop a fertilizer schedule or a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation program until you know those
two things, because you just don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that Travis Higginbotham
mentioned in the last, in his podcast that
[SPEAKER_00]: I just released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I think everyone
needs to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need to know what your
starting inputs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if you have an issue or you
have a problem with the plant health and
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't collect all the information for
everything that you're putting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you're not going to know how to
address the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, like you said,
there's a suitable range for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pH, that's humidity, that's
temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's a, did I miss
any?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much right around
where we need to pay attention to this
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, or soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't know what you've got going
on there, then you're flying blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the water coming out of the tap is
in the suitable range and you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some kind of, you know,
infrequent or frequent weekly testing or
[SPEAKER_01]: daily testing to make sure it's,
if you're like on a well, it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: slide too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say one thing, if you're on a
well, and I've seen this a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are on a new, if let's say you,
let's use a hypothetical situation that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy a property and you're going to,
got your cannabis cultivation license and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to start growing and you get
a water test on the well and it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: great, but you haven't really hit that
well yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't really started pumping water
out of that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're doing frequent tests on
that well, because what I see from a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of wells all around the country is that
after that well starts to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you start pulling water out of that well,
start using it, you'll start seeing iron
[SPEAKER_01]: filling up in the filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing it across the way and
people just keep going ahead and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: got their D chlorinator sediment filter,
which is doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get these high, super high levels
of ferrous iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go back to their water tests
that they did before they actually started
[SPEAKER_01]: using the well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, my water looks
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need to be doing frequent water
tests from your well water or municipal
[SPEAKER_01]: water to understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just do one water test and
expect that you're going to be golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that, Tad, I see that all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have plant problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go check the filters and the
filters are orange with like ferrous iron
[SPEAKER_01]: and clay covered all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, guys, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the water test?
[SPEAKER_01]: When was the last time you had a water
test?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, we had a water test
a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, that's not what your
actual water is anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a great guy, I'm going to give
him a plug and hopefully it doesn't kill
[SPEAKER_01]: me for this, but David Berlin over at
Hyperlogic is one of the best water
[SPEAKER_01]: purification, water masters who I send
pictures of these filters all the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of like, oh, here we go again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them to get a current water test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to be constantly
testing your water as you're using that
[SPEAKER_01]: water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers from an agricultural perspective
will know that their water is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they make adjustments accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some of the reasons you mentioned
and just some of the seasonal changes with
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive rains, bringing down things out
of the mountains and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into we haven't even talked
about some of the stuff that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to talk about, which was this new
trial that you're setting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the some of your findings,
the reasons why you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the aspects of
your trial in terms of controlling for a
[SPEAKER_00]: variable that may not be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started working with LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, three or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked with a lot of the initial
kind of subpar LED fixtures that were out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Fluence came around and,
you know, had some good results with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also had some challenges like
everybody else did in making the
[SPEAKER_01]: transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're kind of, you know,
now, you know, Fluence really was the
[SPEAKER_01]: trendsetter in turning the, you know,
making the paradigm shift to some extent
[SPEAKER_01]: on, you know, really looking at LED
lighting as a excellent choice or solution
[SPEAKER_01]: for indoor controlled environment
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a lot of other companies
that have jumped on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a whole market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you go to some of these trade
shows and it's like a city of LED
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, you know, been primarily working
with the Fluence lighting and seeing some
[SPEAKER_01]: started seeing some interesting results
and different kinds of results from other
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting companies that were developing
different ways of delivering the photons,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that may be spectrum or footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, additional features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I reached out about six months ago to
other lighting companies that had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd seen some interesting results from,
or I'd heard from other consultants or
[SPEAKER_01]: other growers that they were having,
that they were having, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good results from and are happy with the
fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to, you know, kind of do an
imperfect trial and see if any of them any
[SPEAKER_01]: of these other lighting companies would be
willing to kind of go up against what my
[SPEAKER_01]: standard has been, which has been the
SpiderX Plus primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for me to see whether,
you know, where we're at on the market of
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lighting and where certain companies
are doing better things than other
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully putting this out publicly
will improve everyone's product that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're putting out and provide data to
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also perhaps look at, I mean,
so the way that I have the trial set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a fairly small little lab space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got kind of a canopy of
lighting up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: With LED lighting, you can get fairly
close to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though there's going to be some
bleed over into the other light areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll still get a good idea because I'll
be able to put the fixtures fairly close,
[SPEAKER_01]: six to 12 inches away from the light
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that bleed over though for me is
interesting because the fixtures have
[SPEAKER_01]: different color temperatures or different
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be something interesting
to happen in that bleed over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be reading the color temperature
of the canopy in these certain areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data on, you know, the
differences around the canopy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of, you know, there's a, so right now
I've got the SpiderX Plus Spectre and the
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lighting, the GI2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two Vipers, because I always have
people asking me what's better,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Viper or the Spider?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them it has nothing to do with the,
using the Spider or the Viper has more to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with your layout and your design than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the ViperX Plus a lot because it's
a single bar that's fat and covers like a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by three footprint fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot that you can do around
that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the Spider kind of takes up all of
the space above the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a lot of these companies
modeling their fixtures off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture, lighting architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's the best
lighting architecture for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation because a lot of times people
are just designing these lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about the light canopy,
but they're not thinking about everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else that's involved in an indoor grow
space, which is environment, leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, the way that the air is
moving, how the lights can work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just kind of thinking
like, we need to get this amount of PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: over this amount of square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to some extent that can be great,
but we're seeing a lot more of these
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical moving systems, these vertical
rack systems that move and they open up
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have one aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's modeling of a roll top bench,
but just going up vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start cramming all these
lights and plants together into this home
[SPEAKER_01]: position where you've got rows and rows of
these plants, and there's not a lot of air
[SPEAKER_01]: movement, people have been having a lot of
challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at how now the lights being,
these lights like the SpiderX Plus are
[SPEAKER_01]: being repurposed for these vertical moving
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also thinking about how the
architecture of the light can fit that
[SPEAKER_01]: model to allow for more space or for the
environment and environmental control,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been a serious challenge for a
lot of the people that are using these LED
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical moving rack systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing that I've been
looking at is that I have noticed that
[SPEAKER_01]: certain varietals under the Fluence
lighting will, the spectrum, for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, they'll just get what I call tired
after a specific amount of light or
[SPEAKER_01]: duration of light, even at the lower PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say between 200 and 300 PPFD in
veg after 16 hours of light, the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've seen this in multiple grows,
and it could be something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I haven't collected enough data on
everything, but I have seen consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: with that with other individuals online
where the plants, certain plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain varietals just get tired and they
start to droop, like they've had enough
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's time to turn off and it's time to
go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw that really under high
pressure sodium lighting or ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that from the get go with the
Fluence lighting and had to make
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments and then certain things became
more important like vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: or VPD, vapor pressure differential,
and then adjusting the intensity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting and really having to work very
hard on keeping the plants healthy so the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis continues and transpiration
continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think that that has something to do
with the spectrum of the light and the
[SPEAKER_01]: color temperature, and I think there might
be a little bit too much of something and
[SPEAKER_01]: not enough something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what I've done is I've looked
at other lighting companies that have
[SPEAKER_01]: different spectrums and tried to compare
to see if it's something with the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will say that right now I'm using
the BIOS light in the trial, so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really, the Specter light is pretty close
to the Fluence light as far as spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: and design.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little egregious to some extent how
close it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BIOS lighting is kind of its own
beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed by a NASA scientist,
which is kind of cool because I'm all
[SPEAKER_01]: about space travel and NASA and all these
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side note, and I have been vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have plants vegging under the BIOS
lighting and plants the same gelato strain
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging under the Fluence lighting,
and I have noticed off the bat right now
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plants are enjoying the color
temperature a little bit better in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative state under the BIOS lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been vegging at the same PPFD
without getting that tiredness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know if that makes the BIOS
lighting spectrum better for vegetative or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's gonna carry over and I'm
gonna see a benefit in flower because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had fantastic results with the SpiderX
Plus in flower, but it does make it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit easier for me when I'm not
having to deal with the plants getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed out from having too much,
maybe it's too much red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my early findings right now
and I'm gonna be making some more videos
[SPEAKER_01]: on that and posting that up on Instagram
and on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say one thing that BIOS light
is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, I think it's like 40 or 50 pounds
and that is not a one man job hanging that
[SPEAKER_01]: light, whereas the SpiderX can hang that
light in a one man job on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BIOS light, you're definitely gonna
need, the GI2 at least, you're gonna need
[SPEAKER_01]: two people to hang that light,
just a warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised on how heavy it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like the spectrum on the BIOS
light, but it's heavy and it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same radiant cooling design that the
Fluence light has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top of the fixture gets very hot,
like 140, 150 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep all that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's positives and negatives to both
fixtures so far from what I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a couple of thoughts hearing you
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, could you say that maybe the Fluence
light has a potentially better spectrum in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that you could shorten your
photo period because the plant's reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: its DLI or the amount of light that the
plant can take up in a given photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you could take an hour off of
your vegetative period and still get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same growth rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like to veg under Fluence lighting
for 16 hours of light and 18 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that is a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's comparably,
if that creates more growth or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not running the lights for two
additional hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told that to a lot of people and
someone that have asked me about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this tiredness thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, we'll switch to 16 hours of
light and eight hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are hesitant to do
that because it's been kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard to veg for either 18,
six or 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd say if you're using the Fluence
light, try vegging for 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was actually their initial
recommendation when they first put out the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people weren't willing to do
that because they were afraid that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants were gonna flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're getting closer to that photo
periodic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to hear what Travis
Higginbotham comes up with over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year as he gets sort of more entrenched
and experienced in his position.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was our last podcast interview and I
really like what his knowledge and what he
[SPEAKER_00]: had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to follow up with him again
on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my other thought is, if a light is
getting really hot, doesn't that mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense it's less efficient at
converting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Converting energy into photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not criticizing this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking out loud about,
I don't know a lot about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so wattage, so no matter,
wattage is going to create a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of BTUs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have 600 watts, you're gonna
have 600 watts of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that heat, I think it's the,
for every watt, you multiply that times
[SPEAKER_01]: three point four one BTU or three point
one four BTU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgive me if I get the four and the one
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's how you figure out how
much heat, which the engineers call
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible load, is going into the room for
the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with any electronic
device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any electronic device, any device that's
powered, that amount of wattage is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to it is going to create that amount of
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is something that people get
confused about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because you're running an LED
doesn't mean that, so let's say you have
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 watts of LED lighting and then you
have 600 watts of high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna produce the same amount of
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is that from the 600 watt
high pressure sodium light, you're only
[SPEAKER_01]: getting let's say 400 or 500 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 400 or 500, the amount of photons that
are being produced that's usable for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, it's like 400 to 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the LED that's the same
amount of wattage, you're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand or 1100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's producing the same amount of heat,
but more usable light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in theory you could use less
lights, which would also lower the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat being created in a given room,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get the same amount of PPFD as the 600
watt high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why is there so much heat coming off
of the BIOS light?
[SPEAKER_01]: That has to do with the architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the way that the light
is designed to handle the diffusion of
[SPEAKER_01]: that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now BIOS, it seems like BIOS
has opted to go with more of a waterproof
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of very heavy duty design,
which I can understand why they would do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas they have four big chunky bars in
a series and then you look at the Fluence
[SPEAKER_01]: light and they've got eight bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Fluence light has these fins that
you would see, the radiant cooling fins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it spreads the surface area to allow
for better heat diffusion of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more surface area there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing that you'd see on one
of your ballasts or any kind of power
[SPEAKER_01]: source where there's a lot of wattage
going into something or a lot of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: going into something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create those fins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in computer equipment as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows for greater air movement
over the surface of the equipment to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: for better heat dispersion and diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're measuring, you get your
little laser thermometer and measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence light, it does a very good job at
dispersing that heat into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think about is being able to
control the room environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have just ambient heating and
it's being dispersed, that heat is now
[SPEAKER_01]: being spread around the volume of the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to manage, it's easier for
the equipment to cool that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have hot spots,
which is what we're trying to stay away
[SPEAKER_01]: from in cultivation, where we have these
pockets of heat, pockets of humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets of coldness, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only thing that,
oh, and that's one of the positives of
[SPEAKER_01]: having an LED fixture is you get that,
when you look at your ambient temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really kind of seeing what's close
to what your canopy temperature is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have a high pressure
sodium light, it's gonna be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very hot under that bulb because that's
where a lot of that heat is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say the BIOS light,
the heat is being thrown up to the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're below the LED diodes,
it's not anywhere near as hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still have that hot spot above the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got really tall ceilings,
not a big deal, but in this lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have tall ceilings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say that the fixture was heating
up the ceiling, which was about a foot and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 20 degrees higher than I was
getting under the Fluence light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fluence has done a really good job in
figuring out how to disperse that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of my little analysis on
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm excited to hear your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super grateful for all the lighting
companies that have been open to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this because I know that everyone wants,
they don't want any, I'm not trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: any damage to any of these companies at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just trying to give a fair
test so we can look at what's positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all those companies can kind of
come back and use that data to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing because they're all
doing something that's fantastic and
[SPEAKER_01]: unique and exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this is just going to lead to more
efficient cultivation methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I wanted to talk to you
about was sort of your experiences with
[SPEAKER_00]: the different facilities and grow
operations that you've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing out there in
California right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am seeing a lot of fat, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm seeing a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a lot of cultivators and farms
struggling to make the transition over
[SPEAKER_01]: into a commercial business framework and
not having a lot of time to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: because things are moving lightning fast
and it's chaotic and it's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what worked for the last 10 to 15
years doesn't really work anymore because
[SPEAKER_01]: the margins have gone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember a few years ago listening
to Bob Hoffman, who's one of the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: basil growers in the United States,
talked to a bunch of cannabis growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: he said, hey guys, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your margins, they're great now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it while you can because it's going
to go away sooner than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm seeing happen right
now, but people are still cultivating and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cost to produce a pound is still
above $500 on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have an oversupply in California
much like what's going on in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, even though Washington,
Oregon have a much further developed
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market than California does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people forgot that California has been
producing a lot of weed for a really long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all those people are having to pay
taxes and there's a lot of taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably too many taxes, and they haven't
really figured out how to reduce their
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that some people have started
to and it's beginning to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have to do it faster and they
have to take a cue from large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture to some extent if they're
trying to do these massive farms and
[SPEAKER_01]: really try and reduce costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of money being spent on things
that aren't maybe needed and improper
[SPEAKER_01]: planning to understand what you guys are
going to need on the OPEX moving into
[SPEAKER_01]: these grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of going about it the way
that they've been going about it for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 10 years and a lot of people are
failing and a lot of people are hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see as a viable solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were starting a grow or
helping someone that was starting a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you go about analyzing efficiency
and finding ways to improve that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I recommend everybody begin
with is a quote unquote plant program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll see happen a lot of times is
people will start out with a rough idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to do in their space and
then they will lay on top of that space a
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that they can do more than is
actually possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every space that you're working in,
whether it's outdoors, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or whether it's an indoor
cultivation space, it's going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: limitation on how much can be produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cramming more into that space is actually
going to reduce the output than if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were to meet the space with where it's
maybe operationally tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first things I like to do is
sit down and look at the space and create
[SPEAKER_01]: a layout and a floor plan for where every
plant is going to go and then base
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations on what's going to be
produced on what the space can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we've established that floor plan,
now this is assuming that you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: areas or rooms already kind of mapped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, then we look at what the
current equipment is in the facility or
[SPEAKER_01]: the spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about what we're going to spec for
the equipment, but a lot of times I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and doing audits on facilities
that were already built and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly planned from the get-go for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have a lot of times reduce
people's expectations and what they can
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out of the space by looking at what
the space can actually handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go from plant count to what our
equipment sizing is, and then we'll figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out the optimum amount of plants that can
be in each room based on keeping a
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment, based on what the
equipment can handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll come up with a flow for
where the plants begin in the facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're starting as a clone or a
seed and where they're going to end,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we map out every part of that process
and then essentially run a digital form of
[SPEAKER_01]: the operation to give the client or give
the farmer an idea of the path of his grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room and every expendable, every supply
that's needed to get that plant from point
[SPEAKER_01]: A to point Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times people are just kind of
winging it, and what happens when you wing
[SPEAKER_01]: it is you waste a lot of time,
a lot of money, and a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing to do is come up with a
plan, an operational plan and a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: program, and manage your expectations of
what you're going to actually produce out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're a nursery or whether you're
producing for flour, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have enough space for 10,000 clones
or 5,000 clones to be produced per month,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get any more than that
unless you expand your space in an
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what I've been doing now is
looking at that, analyzing why there are
[SPEAKER_01]: fail points and offering people solutions,
and a lot of that has to do with reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're trying to do within the
limitations, about getting real with the
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're describing is very similar
to what Ben Hartman was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: around lean farming or lean manufacturing
in terms of setting up and really
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding workflows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His book is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bugged you for a while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you need to read this book.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would say that I've worked with some
engineering companies on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-production that's involved in planning
out these gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after reading that book, it really
helped me turn it into something tangible
[SPEAKER_01]: after the plan was finished, and also
understanding how to really think about
[SPEAKER_01]: how you plan your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just starting with an
empty rectangle and they're trying to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it in with as many plants and as much
canopy as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just because you have a 20,000
square foot building doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get a 10,000 square foot canopy
out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of space needed for the
actual operations, plant movement,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the first three years of doing some
of this facility design, I'd work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: owner of the building and they'd be like,
we've got a 20,000 square foot building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put a 20,000 square foot canopy in
the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, where are you going to take
a shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people aren't even thinking
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that book was a huge influence on
how all of these things kind of work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lean farm, man, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for turning me onto that book
and thank you for that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think people just need to spend
time planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time spent planning is not time wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's probably the most efficient
thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a culprit of this even now,
I don't have as much SOP or standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure established as I
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because realistically, when you're running
a business or running an operation like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you need everything to be
standardized as much as possible so the
[SPEAKER_00]: employees know what their expectations are
and at the same time have a resource that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go to to understand what they
should be doing and why they're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that you should have
already thought about hopefully in a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect world before starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting your business,
but that's not what happened in my case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close, but we're working towards
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of I think that's the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the case with most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the other thing is a lot of times
people write an SOP and they spend a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of time and money doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get their garden built and
then no one follows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the SOP actually has to make sense and
has to be applied to what's actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see like a manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That manual just gets dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's actually going and using it and
you've got operators that are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of doing their own thing and
setting their whole rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be, that's a kind of
interesting thought too, is like the SOP
[SPEAKER_01]: manual, the best way to be creating best
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that SOP manual is there to kind
of be the backbone, the history of how the
[SPEAKER_01]: building's gonna be operated, but then
what gets put into practice in the
[SPEAKER_01]: business should be simplified.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've even talked about having there be a
iPad in the room that has just the videos
[SPEAKER_01]: on the iPad for every part of the process
for someone to reference because so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people are learning things off of YouTube
and online streaming services.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe our SOP should be geared towards how
people are actually learning these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: less people are learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could be wrong, but I think a
lot of people are learning through online
[SPEAKER_01]: services and podcasts like this one and
YouTube and you need to learn something
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier to have it shown to you
than have to go through and read the
[SPEAKER_01]: directions and hope that you're reading it
correctly and then translating it into
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we need to be looking at how we
structure our SOPs, depending upon what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're writing the SOP for, of course,
but maybe there's a better way of having
[SPEAKER_01]: these best practices displayed for the
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I've been kind of
playing around with, maybe perhaps turning
[SPEAKER_01]: Poetry of Plants into an instructional
company where there's videos online to
[SPEAKER_01]: show every part of these processes for
different steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that might be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny because for me, I tend to not
like videos as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hearing things, obviously with
having a podcast, that's something I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy, but I love to read and I love to
read things and see them visually that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's something complicated,
like putting together furniture,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a visual guide, like a video,
like you said, is pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's like mixing up fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that is pretty easy to
screw up off of a set of written
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everyone learns different too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people are better at reading or
listening or watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you have to have a combination of
all three to really have it make sense and
[SPEAKER_01]: the staff can access it based on how they
prefer to learn, make it easy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that gets a little controversial in
terms of what they've come up with in
[SPEAKER_00]: education around research and learning,
but we don't need to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that I did with my
master's degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you briefly tell me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the basics would be this idea of
sensory learning that some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: auditory learners or some people are
visual learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found when they actually did a lot of
research on it, it didn't really play out
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as well as people thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is something to having different
modalities of teaching in terms of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you explain or teach a subject,
but no one is a single modality in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that they learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't just learn from an auditory
perspective or from a visual perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: or from a sensory perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets a little more complicated than
that, I guess, but it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see younger generations being
much more focused or more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: watching videos and learning from videos
than prior generations, like myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a nine-year-old son and we do
a lot of Legos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the Lego instruction
manual, it's like step-by-step with the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and with the direction of how this
is getting put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can figure out how to put together
a Lego for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there's a combination of those
things that we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: just something we're talking about,
but people actually can access the best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and the standards and they know
what the standards are because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times they're walking into the facility
and people don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just end up, they get shown it
once or twice and then they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: creating their own method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that could be a better method or
maybe not, but that's something for the
[SPEAKER_01]: operation manager and the operational
management to decide not a new hire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just see these kinds of things where
it's back to what we were talking about as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as lowering the operational costs,
improving quality, lowering the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: production, and really taking a cue from
other companies that have been successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cannabis cultivator,
a lot of people are touring a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the place to find the best
information on agricultural best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like go to a real farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to, now I wouldn't even say cannabis is
not a real farm, but go to an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: farm or produce farm that's dialed in,
that's successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you can get a tour of their
facility and see how they're doing their
[SPEAKER_01]: processes because those are the processes
that are gonna be applied to cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well learn it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see a lot of reluctance from
people saying that the horticultural world
[SPEAKER_00]: or the agricultural world doesn't
understand cannabis and has frankly been a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit arrogant towards cannabis
because it has been a black market crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and a plant to grow for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, there's so much
more research and science that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this existing body of work to pull from if
we look at what's going on in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and what's going on on
commercial farms and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing workflows and how they're
processing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, cannabis is a special plant in a lot
of ways, but I think in the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate it in most cases, I mean there's
some things around photoperiod and such
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients, but overall it's another
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people get too caught up in
sort of this spirituality around the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that they aren't willing to embrace some
of the knowledge that's already out there
[SPEAKER_00]: or go in search of it when they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's because they're
afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's scary because it's moving
into becoming an actual business and less
[SPEAKER_01]: of a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't want to let that
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe, yeah, that might be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Ag doesn't know how to grow cannabis
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say they'll figure it out at some
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they won't figure it out to the
point that you don't have to take away the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and the artisanship that these
cannabis farmers have developed because
[SPEAKER_01]: they absolutely have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I haven't seen too many people
coming from Big Ag that can grow the same
[SPEAKER_01]: level of flower that people that have been
cultivating and working with the plant for
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years because it does become like
playing an instrument, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You develop a sixth sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You develop a skill set around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's figure out how that artisanship
that you amazing cannabis cultivators have
[SPEAKER_01]: developed in the last 10 years,
20 years, 30 years can now be applied
[SPEAKER_01]: within the agricultural format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go meet those people, become friends
with them, see if you can bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: information they don't know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will be open to show you guys what
they're doing and how they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce their costs because you're not
going to have an opportunity to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis if you're still spending $600,
$700 to produce a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you won't be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to just let those take off the
armor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's have an open conversation
about this being a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigma is going away and let's figure
out a better way of cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that have been working with
the plant and developing the artisanship
[SPEAKER_01]: that make it so special can stay in the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what I try and help
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning how to do that every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning from the PhD greenhouse
manager that grows, you know, micro
[SPEAKER_01]: greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning that from the Humboldt
farmer that's using KNF living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's something of value to
learn from all of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just work on merging those
worlds, finding the similarities of where
[SPEAKER_01]: they all can meet and improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ceiling to how we can improve
how we cultivate plants at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't see the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's so much more to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the real challenge then is how
do we scale these methods or how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: scale an artisan farmer in order to stay
relevant as this industry blows up?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would go, I'm going to reference a
lot of what Ben talked about in lean farm
[SPEAKER_01]: is we have to scale the cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to know what the consumer wants to
buy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scaling is going to be partly connected
to what we're growing and what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we really know what that
is yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's being developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I'm saying that is I'm seeing that
flowers becoming less valuable in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than all the derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen a lot of eight pens,
a lot of, you know, hash derivatives and
[SPEAKER_01]: variations of hash becoming more popular
and more convenient for consumption than
[SPEAKER_01]: having a jar of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always number one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's something that I love the
experience of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love looking at the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love smelling the flower, but a lot of
the new people that are coming online they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to go around smelling like a
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also they maybe prefer the different
delivery methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about that and we have to
think like, well, what is the percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: of the flower going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is the retail sales of flower
going to be as we move forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be 70% 80% of what it's
kind of been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to be more like five to 10%
of the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it ends up going to where I think
it's going to go where it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: much smaller margin on the market and
we're going to be moving towards these
[SPEAKER_01]: derivatives, then it doesn't and it
doesn't matter as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but it doesn't matter as
much as if you're producing like these
[SPEAKER_01]: really crazy looking flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's the case, then you know,
cause those crazy looking flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: those amazing, beautiful flowers take a
lot of energy, a lot of time and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people aren't willing to pay a fair
market price for them, then they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of, you know, what I see
if it takes, if it costs $600 to produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: triple A beautiful top shelf pound of the
most highest level flower, and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: only sell it for $700, which is like the
cost of producing it or $800.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that flower is going to go away until
it can command a higher value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to see is large scale
operations where it's not, the focus isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily on the aesthetic of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be more on the chemical
concentrations that can be produced and
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of it can be produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So answering your question, if we're
looking at a derivative market and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: producing cannabis for a derivative
market, why are we applying the same
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies and costly methodologies of
producing very, very high quality or close
[SPEAKER_01]: to the high quality flower if it's just
going to be turned into a derivative in
[SPEAKER_01]: the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people haven't thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, my humble opinion,
they've designed these massive facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: that have cost a lot of money and then
over half or 70% of all of what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: producing is being turned into some kind
of derivative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are planning your cannabis
business and you want to grow flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a brand behind you,
even better, you'll probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful, more successful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your brand has any kind of marketing
advantage, I would share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just getting into this,
really think about what percentage of your
[SPEAKER_01]: sales are going to be flower sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you come to the same conclusion
that I am, which is that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: lower than all the derivatives,
then build a facility out with economies
[SPEAKER_01]: of scale in place and focus on producing
biomass that can be turned into
[SPEAKER_01]: derivatives, which requires a lot less
input and energy than it does if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of roundabout answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're definitely seeing that here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: People moving towards more concentrates
and moving away from flower in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, which I agree with you, is a little
bit unfortunate, but it is the reality of
[SPEAKER_00]: where the industry is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now you can get cannabis sugar
and cannabis gummies and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate and pretty much anything you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have no idea what that plant
looked like?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you have no idea what the plant looked
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what it was grown with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know the quality of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you really are getting are these
constituent cannabinoids, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little scary to me in a lot
of ways, just because- Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's some testing going on around
it, but the regulations have not cut up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're just going to have to
wait and see how it all pans out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people still growing high
quality flower out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know quite a few, but it is getting
tougher and tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying this not because I like the
reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some amazing cultivators
that I'm hoping that it'll swing back the
[SPEAKER_01]: other way and then we'll, you know,
at some point when everything's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: calmed down a bit, there's going to be a
clearly defined market for batik,
[SPEAKER_01]: really high quality cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But please, if you grow really,
really, really awesome, epic flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are valuable and you're important and
you're special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your head though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make smart business decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five to 10 years from now, you can
continue to grow that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might mean you have to be a
little bit nimble on what you want it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with where your direction,
where your trajectory is at, with where it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is survival mode for most
cannabis companies right now, unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got hundreds of millions of dollars
behind you and you can afford the crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: burn rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, if you are one of these craft
growers and I see you all, I see these
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers all the time and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see them disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out how to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about a longer term plan and
thinking about, you know, you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: to pivot and grow lower quality product
that's going to go to derivatives just to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to keep the business open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not anything you should really
stress out about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just be like, okay,
this is what I have to do right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust that it's going to come back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The artisanship will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's only going to survive if the
artists continue to produce, if they all
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of the game because it's too
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what are we going to be left with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, you know, make smart business
decisions, be okay with yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to judge you if you've got
to grow flower for derivatives for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stick around because the art that
you've brought to the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would hurt if all of those people
disappeared and we just had, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: massive hedge funds growing, you know,
mid grade product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all that was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be like, you know,
the beer industry where it took like 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 years for craft beer to come out and to
come back into the fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just say, let's be smart about
it to keep the artisan growers around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know this podcast is cannabis
cultivation and science, but I almost want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have someone on to talk about marketing
and branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you should, I want people to
survive these like artisan growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, the only ones I know
of that are really thriving right now or
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeding are the ones that have really,
really strong marketing branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've captured, you know,
a certain demographic of their,
[SPEAKER_00]: of their community that is firm believers
in what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been able to share the message
of how they're cultivating with a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately that's so important for
companies nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I've had to learn
the hard way myself with my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was spending way too much time arguing
obscure scientific references with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people online when I should have been
marketing my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be a much more successful
businessman right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of starting this podcast was a
way for me to get some of my message,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a greater message of what,
you know, the philosophy of people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: believed in or had access to out to other
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they won't make the same mistake with
their businesses that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, learn, learn from my
mistakes too, in that regard and really
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in that as much, as much as I hate
marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to be careful because my fiance
is a marketing director here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think she listens to all my
podcasts, but it's not something that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: terribly passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really have to find someone that
is, that's really going to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: business to the next level if you want to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's so many aspects around
social media now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a global economy and it's so
important that we reach out beyond just
[SPEAKER_00]: our local area and people really find out
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're limited to a particular
state with your cultivation, getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: message out there to as wide of an
audience as possible is only going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you be more successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is sometimes some of the
best growers in the world, they don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's some kind of a boutique
grower farm management company that could
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge out of all this that could help
organize and create a channel or a freeway
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of these boutique growers that
just want to grow so they can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: be supported and successful as long as it
was done in an ethical way and a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't some crazy, you know,
we're going to control and own everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think it's important that people
still feel the sense of freedom that they
[SPEAKER_01]: had when they were cultivating in the
black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a free feeling to be,
and not that it was all a good thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you had people spraying a bunch of
crap on all the plants and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being in that space where you're kind
of outside of society and you're creating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got like wings that are so large,
no one can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something about that that is
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get put into the system
and the structure and you've got all these
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes you have to check off, it can limit
that creative experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe there's a way of still
creating that creative experience inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something that could be discussed at
a further date.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can kind of see that some
other industries, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know for me with my business,
trying to hire outside help with marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: became really, really expensive and really
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasted thousands of dollars on this
in terms of hiring the wrong people or not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting what I thought I was getting out
of it or investing in avenues that were
[SPEAKER_00]: just not productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting money into maybe ads wasn't the
right revenue source for my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all trial and error things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really tough for a
grower, especially someone without a
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing background, to figure all of
that out and get into the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out where they should be putting
their money into marketing so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that's data analysis and
requires having a lot more information
[SPEAKER_00]: than the average grower is gonna have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fairly insulated in what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of challenges around
marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I will have to have someone on
to kind of talk about that if there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an interest, please people
reach out, shoot me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you're interested in me
talking about that with someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know we have a lot of other people
that are just cultivating for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: or on a medical level where they don't
really need or want that information too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a good friend of
mine who always said that everyone in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business, up until recently,
has been doing business, but they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have to be in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just be doing business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that, I think all that information
and coaching on that is really important
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it applies to the cannabis world
and how it's being shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to
cover before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just I'm excited to get to work,
you know, to follow through and continue
[SPEAKER_01]: on with this podcast that we have coming
up, The Dope History Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really looking forward to
this next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Nelson Linsley from Poetry of
Plants.

[SPEAKER_00]: The narratives we've heard so far are
really fascinating and the history behind
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant and the effect it's had on our
culture and the people involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing us towards legalization is just
incredible.
