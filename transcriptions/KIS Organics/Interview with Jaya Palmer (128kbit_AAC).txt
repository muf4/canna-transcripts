[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is not only an awesome
grower and passionate gardener,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaya Palmer is a biological horticulture
consultant with a passion for sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: human settlement and cognitive liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: His mission is to excite and inspire
people to utilize cannabis as a fulcrum to
[SPEAKER_01]: raise consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaya believes we can realize the genetic
potential of plants with organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative methods that focus on feeding
and diversifying biology and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Jaya back in 2011, literally on the
day I was mixing one of my first batches
[SPEAKER_01]: of our Kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I was running our family
business manufacturing compost tea brewing
[SPEAKER_01]: machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit it off pretty quickly, talking
about different aspects of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that time, Jaya has been the one
coordinating much of our field research
[SPEAKER_01]: and testing and one of my go-to guys
regarding beneficial insects, lighting,
[SPEAKER_01]: product testing, and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further ado, though, here's our
latest conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off asking him a bit about how
we first met and a little more of his
[SPEAKER_01]: personal history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I met you, I seeked you out
because I had just got back from an Elaine
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham soil food web week-long intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we covered compost, compost tea,
microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I came back to Seattle looking for
anyone who looked at their soil or compost
[SPEAKER_00]: under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were the only person who was doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were one of the heads,
one of the leaders in that compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, I was living in a farm in
Snohomish, growing about 100 different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of veggies on several acres and
managing the farmer's market every week
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing a whole bunch of tomatoes,
about 4,000 square feet of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that farm certified organic when
I was working out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, my best friend was
growing medical cannabis in cocoa with
[SPEAKER_00]: botanic hair nutrients and having a lot of
troubles with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying to apply what I was doing
with tomatoes that was going really well
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't very competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of decided that this Pure
Blend Pro half organic, half synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach was the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we were learning from the
grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we tried your soil,
the KISS soil, it yielded easily 20%,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was way easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gave you some of that soil back in
the day when you showed up as a sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just threw a plant in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sort of started the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your buddy expanded upon it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your friend was actually the one that
started experimenting with growing in beds
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the reamending and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you were instrumental working
with him during all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk a little bit about that
process and how you go about evaluating a
[SPEAKER_01]: product?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an important thing for
people to consider as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, depending on how much I believe in
the product will determine how large of an
[SPEAKER_00]: area of the garden to dedicate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are we going to do one plant or one
light or a quarter of the space or half
[SPEAKER_00]: the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started with the KISS soil,
we did one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it didn't seem very believable
to us that it was going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did one light and then we converted
the whole thing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always have a control whenever we
bring in something new to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know if it actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to quantify exactly how well it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if it justifies the expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the size of the container is what
changed the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in medical, we were always limited
with a small plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would want to grow larger
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just kept doing more and more soil,
large and larger pots on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became more easy to the point we
had fabric pots squished together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's roots growing through the
sides of the pots, which was great because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was sort of homogenizing the water
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a group of plants would all take
the same amount of water per square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: or per light, however you want to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, we were like,
why don't we just put sides in this table
[SPEAKER_00]: and fill it up with soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we discovered that holds a lot more
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really where I think you get
the full potential out of the keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: simple soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just the style of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make it just about my
company and my products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's other people out there
making these types of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you and I have the most
experience with our recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far into soils,
I would like to give listeners a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more of your background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know after we met, you started the
Seattle Mushroom Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a lot of other things outside
of the cannabis world, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to get a lot of our
information and our horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge from beyond what we're getting
just with cannabis and just within people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell people a little bit more
of your permaculture background,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the other things that you've done
beyond cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before I was remotely concerned with
cultivating cannabis, my passion was
[SPEAKER_00]: gourmet mushroom production, indoor
gourmet mushroom production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I built numerous clean rooms and
fruity rooms at different places I lived
[SPEAKER_00]: and with different partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The culmination of that was the mushroom
farm in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a mini farm in my business
partner's backyard and basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took up most of the basement and had
our 12 by 12 fruiting room in the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: where we grew about 200, maybe 300 pounds
of mushrooms a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did oyster mushrooms and shiitake,
mitake, a little bit of reishi for fun and
[SPEAKER_00]: sold them to the local restaurants and the
farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realized that I didn't want to own a
mushroom farm because it's just too
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, I lived for five years I
lived between two different intentional
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and was really into
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started studying permaculture in New
Mexico with Rico Zuc and then with
[SPEAKER_00]: Starhawk in California and the Bullock
Brothers on Orcas Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out for a couple of their
courses and their site is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to all the Paul Stamets
courses on mushroom production.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a cultivation seminar and a
mycelium running micro restoration seminar
[SPEAKER_00]: that are both amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks a mile a minute, 10 hours a day
loses his voice at the end of each course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really amazing to see his set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is obviously your growing is
obviously your passion or cultivation in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you've more recently turned a
lot of that knowledge towards cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: even we could just say indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about some of the things that
you're currently working on or things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're most excited about in that realm?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really excited by indoor ag
because the productive potential is
[SPEAKER_00]: unmatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get more involved in light depth
greenhouse light assisted production
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that's ultimately the most
sustainable way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so much less energy usage as
long as the heating is done sustainably
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's really this argument that
indoor is not sustainable because it uses
[SPEAKER_00]: so much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if our electricity comes from a clean
source and our greenhouse production is
[SPEAKER_00]: using propane or natural gas for heating,
then that carbon footprint might be worse
[SPEAKER_00]: than the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've really, it's a concern of mine to
go down the path that makes most sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoor ag is just so much more
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to control every environmental
factor and control your water and control
[SPEAKER_00]: the air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create slight variations and do
trials so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I feel like I bring is I kind
of bring the outdoors in because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's crucial if you're going to be
organic, it's crucial to use predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs and use bio controls and to be
mindful of crop rotation and this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping we can get the bug lady on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sent her a message, but can we talk a
little bit more about bugs since I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that you have quite a bit
of knowledge on?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we wanted to talk about IPM,
why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with integrated pest management,
I know that there are not a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: organic programs out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you like to start with your sort
of, in terms of an organic IPM strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, IPM, a lot of people say this is my
IPM program and they have a spray formula
[SPEAKER_00]: or a spray schedule and spraying is not
what you start out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: With IPM, you start out by scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look around to see if you have a pest
or what predators you have on site and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you monitor them to keep track of
their populations and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're managing them below an economic
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's time to do something
about it, spraying everything isn't always
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution because a crucial part of
every sustainable organic IPM program are
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites and predatory beetles or
it depends on what pest pressure you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have in your area, but the basics that
everyone should utilize are the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dwelling predatory mite, which is
Stradiolapcimitus, and then the rove
[SPEAKER_00]: beetle, which is Delocia coriaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two will typically naturalize in a
grow room, in pots or in beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might not need to reintroduce them
for a year or longer, but monitoring is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to make sure you still have
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys maintain fungus gnats and
root aphids below an economic threshold
[SPEAKER_00]: with no other products needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decemitus, is that the one that you said
you were finding naturally in the Oldie
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain fish compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, almost every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll open up a bag of it and I
don't see any of them, but they might
[SPEAKER_00]: still hatch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've received yards of it,
many times it's disturbing how many
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites are in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That compost is worth way more as a
predatory mite inoculant than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that goes back to it having sat
for so long, being such a static compost
[SPEAKER_01]: pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what allows those larger organisms
to come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compost that's been sitting around for
a while, which is good, leaving it static
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while and getting the fungal counts
up, that can bring in fungus gnats which I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see, I see them as the most minor
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never see them get above an economic
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, you get fungus gnats in
compost, both these huge amounts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites, the fungus gnats are
minimal or sometimes not even there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk about economic threshold,
what you're saying is we're not trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a clean room like you do with your
mushroom production, but rather we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to manage these organisms at a
level to where they're not going to damage
[SPEAKER_01]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a yellow sticky card,
every 50 square feet and every day you
[SPEAKER_00]: count 50 fungus gnats on it, you've got to
develop some sort of SOP to monitor your
[SPEAKER_00]: pest populations and be clear about what
your definition of light, medium or heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: pest pressure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have low to medium fungus gnats
pressure, it's not affecting yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not at an economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a problem if you're taking
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want fungus gnats when you're
propagating, but it takes really high
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of them for it to decrease
your crop yield or crop quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's getting to a point where it
could affect your yield, then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do something about it, like use a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the economic threshold then is
applying this product going to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive than ignoring the pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find fungus gnats, anytime you bring
in any organic matter, like compost or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you're exposing
yourself to fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, they're really not that
big of a deal, relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a blog post already on KISS
Organics for fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say just people can start
there, but let's talk about other problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know spider mites, broadened hemp russet
mites, those would be two things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know you've put a lot of time in
researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your experiences there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, spider mites are pretty easy to
knock out with a light spray, spray oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: soap, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really, everything I've tried on
spider mites works to get their
[SPEAKER_00]: populations down, but it's hard to wipe
out a hundred percent of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally possible, but I always tell
people to, if you're dealing with spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, spray a few times, three days
apart, to get the populations very low and
[SPEAKER_00]: then release persimilis or phalasses to
clean up what's left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to knock them out
quickly, you can get the mites shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: loose on bran or vermiculite and put,
and you can sprinkle them on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and that really, and that can
actually wipe out spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, if you don't think you
have populations of pests or you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very low, you can get time release
sachets where the pediatria mites slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: crawl out of a little sack that hangs from
the plants over the course of two to four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really affordable,
really easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get the sachets of Andersoni
and Swirskyi, which are predators that
[SPEAKER_00]: predate the russet mites and broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these would be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to be spraying botanical
oils or soaps that are going to kill these
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go ahead and get that spraying
done ahead of time if we need to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a preventative and a
maintenance plan, you bring in these mites
[SPEAKER_01]: after the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing I want to
differentiate is that if we're four weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: into flower, it's really too late at that
point to treat a lot of these things in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The predatory mites are not going to be
fast enough acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be spraying on these
botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of screwed at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important as you're going
into flower that you have a clean crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have a plan in place and that you
have the mites that you want ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate or is there anything you
want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there are some products you
can spray later in flower, but there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do spray something like that,
I would wash it off immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the predators do usually take a
couple of weeks to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them don't navigate the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sprinkle them on the top,
it kind of forces them into the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely after week, around week
four, keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anything else you want to talk
about regarding mites or russet mites or
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically broad mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any particular favorite sprays
or remedies around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first dealt with broad mites,
I was testing all the products from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden store, like SNS products,
sulfur, safer soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was diluting them to the proper rate
and then applying it to the broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the scope, I spent a good,
solid week and a half of my life doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And broad mites just swam around in
everything except for green cleaner,
[SPEAKER_00]: of all things, old stage green cleaner,
which is it's a soybean and soap product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 25B compliant, which means it doesn't
need a EPA registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's overpriced for what it is,
but it works and it's gentle on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also products that are listed
for broad mites like Eco-Tech or Eco-Trol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are similar formulas and that's an
armory listed product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also horticultural oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people don't mind using petroleum oil,
there's these mineral oil type of
[SPEAKER_00]: paraffinic oil products that are really
light and don't have any VSCs and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: armory listed and they work really well
against all mites and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the JMS stylet oil that you told
me about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, JMS stylet oil is, I believe,
the only armory powdery mildew eradicant
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually destroys the powdery mildew
that's rooted into the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I hadn't heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Suf Oil X is the other one I
like a lot that's a little bit more common
[SPEAKER_00]: in ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it works well on powdery mildew,
but I don't know if it has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about these oil options,
weren't you also mixing the green cleaner
[SPEAKER_01]: with high quality neem oil in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you're still doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, when I was dealing with
broad mites at multiple locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green cleaner could, we could
eliminate broad mites with green cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, just green cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is only one green cleaner
application and then like if it was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower, and we couldn't spray it again,
if we mixed neem with it, we could go a
[SPEAKER_00]: month without seeing a sign of a broad
mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the neem really helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was using Ahimsa Organics,
an ounce per gallon of the Ahimsa and two
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce per gallon of the green cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and one other thing to touch on is
when you are spraying, it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: have multiple modes of action there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's never a bad idea to do like say a
green cleaner neem oil application and
[SPEAKER_01]: then follow it with maybe the JMS stylet
oil or something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not applying say green cleaner
every three days, because the mites will
[SPEAKER_01]: build up a resistance or it will be less
effective over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something just that's
important to point out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, so we touched a little bit on some
of the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk about powdery mildew
at all, or your experience with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously something a lot of people
are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so powdery mildew I feel like most
growers think that your humidity should be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 50s or 60s during flower and the
relative humidity, 40s or 50s during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just too dry, too arid for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the years, we've found that
lots of strains get powdery mildew in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and there's some that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we grow the ones that don't get
powdery mildew in this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually all we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we learn more about vapor pressure
deficit, VPD, and started running our
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms around in the 70s, even like the mid
to high 70s, I could say 75% humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: 82 degrees, or 72% humidity and 78
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that VPD, we find powdery mildew dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take a plant covered in powdery
mildew, put it in that room, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew turns brown and dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or if you want to spray it off once
with the soap product, it stays clean
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't believe this
because there's the research saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew spores will germinate more
at higher humidities, which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue is the powdery mildew lives
on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not living on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant is in the optimal
environment, then it has the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight off that infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only caveat is if you run a high VPD
all the way to the end of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can increase your chances of getting
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only if the, only if the calyx is
hitting the dew point, which essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: when the lights turn off, the temperature
drops quickly and the humidity rises
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can hit dew point in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how you get botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turning off lights slowly or having
proper environmental controls takes care
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still working out exactly how
much we want to taper off the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of the flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pretty controversial idea
that you've just thrown out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes against everything you kind of learn
as an indoor grower through, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional wisdom or stoner science or
grow shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be clear, you're saying run
your humidity in your rooms based off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD chart, which I will link to one right
on the podcast page for those who haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by staying within optimal VPD,
the plant is actually able to fight off a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these, a lot of the PM problems
that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything I'm missing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, what is the guy's name who talks
about plant health?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a healthy plant,
then it can fight off pests and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, it might be Kempf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's people talking about it
around John Kempf around bricks levels and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know, I don't know enough
to know if Kempf is right about all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or if he's going a little bit too
far in the, you know, don't worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: pests, worry about the plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that you should prioritize plant
health first and optimize the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that term loosely because the
plant's immune system is, it kind of is
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment and the soil and the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you optimize the environment,
if you optimize the VPD and all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: other environmental controls are in order,
then yeah, plants can just fight off the
[SPEAKER_00]: PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and also when you go,
when you run this, this lower VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is higher humidity, the plant
physiology is much different too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a longer inner node and you get
way more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm seeing plants double or triple in
height after the day they're clicked over
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, which is opposed to a normal,
more arid standard room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd see plants grow by 50% or a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the end of the,
at time of harvest, then the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: usually rather than just growing 50% more
than it was in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was three feet, it finished at
four and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying it's finishing closer to six
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be prepared for,
uh, explosion of growth, but it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates to yield seeing higher trichome
density also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I haven't been able to compare
cannabinoid tests or turpenoid tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm assuming it will be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're starting at around six,
let's say 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then throughout flower, you're slowly
transitioning it lower and lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you finishing at by the time
you get to harvest and how much are you
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: It say on a weekly basis in veg,
if veg is around 78, 79 degrees and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity will be in at least 70%,
ideally 75, as long as it's, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where if you're putting too much
humidity in the air, you can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you can get condensation on walls or
floors anywhere where it's a cold area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm finding, I'm saying swampier the
better to an extent for veg, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you've got to make sure it's not
comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in flower, I really am leaning
towards 78 to 82 in, um, for temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and around 75% for humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this all, this all equates to
like a 0.8 to one VPD VPD is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want 0.8 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the zone for flower and
then tapering it off just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end and the last three weeks
of flower bringing the humidity down a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still in the upper sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems crazy high to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I haven't had a chance to test
this theory because I'm not currently
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, but I love the idea of it based
on what I'm learning through you and
[SPEAKER_01]: others about vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I would say the sketchy thing is not
how wet it is during the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when the light cycle ends and the
temperature drops and you have that much
[SPEAKER_00]: more water in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the point where humidity is
going to shoot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going to shoot up into the
eighties or nineties if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: proper controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have the luxury of having
these big dehumidifiers, if you just do
[SPEAKER_00]: air exchange, if you can do enough air
exchange when the lights turn off to
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust, to evacuate all that air,
which is holding tons of watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in cooler, drier air from the
outside that can cushion the cushion that
[SPEAKER_00]: rise in humidity from when lights turn
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my experience with humidity has
primarily been with vegetable crops
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and where I see big, big swings
in humidity, say we have a sunny day
[SPEAKER_01]: followed by a really rainy cloudy day or
vice versa, where that humidity fluctuates
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can guarantee that my squash plants are
going to have powdery mildew within a day
[SPEAKER_01]: or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that this seems to be the case
with cannabis too, to a certain extent in
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of people are taking a plant at
relatively speaking a lower level of light
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg and higher humidity and then
flip-flopping it virtually overnight,
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping your humidity and raising your
light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that those are really creating
a lot of the conditions for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're seeing with these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first we were running our
humidifiers only during the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we needed them exclusively and
we didn't want to over humidify it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark cycle because that's where we knew
the issues were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we put the plants which had PM on
them in that room and only humidified
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day, it didn't kill the PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to keep the humidity high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say humidity high, I mean keep the
VPD at the appropriate level or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do it 24 hours a day,
otherwise it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and PM needs temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's temperature or humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs the fluctuation to sporulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a tight diff, your day to
night temperature differential,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you won't get PM sporulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could still be there vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to see that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these high VPD levels I found actually
eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no size on the leaf anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none of the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that note, we're talking about room
conditions right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just at a consultation the other day
and I walked in and they had a lot of fans
[SPEAKER_01]: going in the room and they weren't in
optimal VPD ranges, which was one
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were dealing with a lot of
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found was the plants that were in
the middle of the room, the ones that were
[SPEAKER_01]: being subjected to the most airflow,
looked a lot worse than the ones that were
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of neglected in the corner,
more or less, that weren't having quite as
[SPEAKER_01]: much airflow right over the leaf surface,
affecting the evapotranspiration of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we mitigate or properly control
that aspect of our environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much air movement can cause a plant to
suffer from powdery mildew also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then not enough air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves will get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Fluence was saying one square foot
per second, or one meter per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a measurement for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just ordered an ananometer to
measure wind speed so I can actually give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the wind speed you need above
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the wind speed you need
below the canopy or through the canopy to
[SPEAKER_00]: assure that you're going to have enough
air movement that the plant can breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's not enough air movement to
flush away the air right underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, it's just not getting access to the
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also get a little microclimate
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these super humid
microclimates if you don't have air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the size of the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In smaller spaces, wall mount fans work
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be mindful if you want
them set on a higher speed blowing above
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy or a lower speed blowing at the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can blow them at a high
speed directly at the canopy, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be far enough away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of something that you learn by
feel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you want to see the leaves move,
but you want to see them move as little as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it's getting yellow or if it's
getting a little scratch mark looking
[SPEAKER_00]: things along the veins, you can tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's the margin of the leaf is
twisting up, there's lots of wind stress
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got to communicate with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally in our greenhouse,
we have a 85 by 30 foot greenhouse and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have two big fans on either corner that
helps circulate the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cannot grow cucumbers or tomatoes on
the first two rows right in front of that
[SPEAKER_01]: fan because they get so much wind damage
and wind stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like crap pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing I find is that because
they are stressed and they are damaged
[SPEAKER_01]: that if I do get mites or powdered mildew
or any other disease, those are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the first plants I'm going to find them
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really do think there is something
to, like you said, creating this immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system around our plants by providing an
optimal environment for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that are less healthy are
going to be more susceptible to expressing
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew and getting spider mites
and all of these other problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have horizontal airflow fans in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other thing that's how all
greenhouses generally have horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow fans where there's fans in one
half of the greenhouse pointing one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction and fans in the other half of
the greenhouse pointing the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps the air moving in a vortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really efficient way to get
air circulation through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually easier to do it that way
than it is with wall fans because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just more consistent airflow throughout
the space and it gets airflow down by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get airflow through the canopy
and by the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we touched a little bit on
lighting with Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more,
though, in terms of what your experience
[SPEAKER_01]: has been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you just recently, I know,
set up a room with LEDs, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different experience from what I'm
understanding from your previous grows
[SPEAKER_01]: with grow experience being around
double-ended HPS and even single-ended
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little more about that
maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from single-ended to double-ended
was dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10% or 20% more efficient and way
better life footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had to deal with hoods that weren't
ducted and so much more heat with HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth it to use a non-vented
hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the DEHPS and use a larger air
conditioner, it's worth it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: production, but it's so energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been wanting LEDs to get there
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until last, I think it was last
August, there was this great article from
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Bugby from Ohio State University
comparing the efficiency of all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DEHPS lights were 1.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro moles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best LEDs in the market at the
time were 1.7 also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Fluence came out with their new
product line and they're all around 2.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectrum is tailored to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way they're designed, they have really
uniformer radiance, meaning wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: check a light level across the canopy,
it's close to the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really easy to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have a learning curve because
the light is so intense that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: start them higher up or dimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a plant has never been under LEDs
before, they have to be acclimated slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can do weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like their leaves can get curly or wrinkly
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can turn white from iron
chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also going with, I'm going with
this VPD program and the levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluence recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really helpful in that they
recommend temperatures and humidities and
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 levels and light levels and PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how to optimize the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're not using
supplemental CO2, then there's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to use more than 500 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more than 500 PPFD of light,
then it's just not going to be utilized or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to stress the plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is supplemental CO2, then it's
possible to go up to a thousand PPFD or
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a light meter that you like
for people who don't have one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the sunlight, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun system PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the one with the remote sensor so you
don't have to stare at an instrument being
[SPEAKER_00]: held under a bright light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're a rebranded Apogee,
which is a PAR meter that like fish tank
[SPEAKER_00]: people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's even cheaper than the
Apogee and it's even got the, it's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same sensor on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Sun system PAR meter with remote
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a link to it on our website so
people can find it if they want to order
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find it to be a really useful tool
in your, in your experience with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, going around and seeing these
gardens and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's crucial because you could
take a gig, you know, a pretty good stab
[SPEAKER_00]: at what the light level is, but you don't
really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, cause you have pupils that
get bigger and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really hard to gauge subtle
differences in light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have different needs for
cuttings versus young vegetative plants
[SPEAKER_00]: versus mature plants versus flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the environmental levels,
it's, it's best to transition them slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: like slowly increase light with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up an interesting thing for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of what tools do I think every
grower should have in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go out on a consult,
there's certain things that I like to have
[SPEAKER_01]: in my bag because I know I'm going to want
to use them in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every grower should have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jeweler's loop would be the first thing
I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look closer at the plant,
look for bugs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an iPhone which allows me to take
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm talking about at, you know,
legal 502 grows where they're allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: have plants there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to worry about any
location data or problems like that with
[SPEAKER_01]: my photos, but actually in notes,
which is an app on my phone, I can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and then I can write notes below
it and have a date and know exactly when I
[SPEAKER_01]: took that photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can go back and visually verify what
I'm finding as well as take notes on that
[SPEAKER_01]: image, which I find really, really handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson talked about that infrared
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can measure the temperature at the
leaf surface, right at the height of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, which I think is another really
important tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're talking about light meters
as one more thing that every grower should
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that you would add
to that list?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a microscope strong enough to
find a Brodmite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them with cheaper USB
microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I've seen Brodmites under like a
$50 microscope, but the $130 ones are way
[SPEAKER_00]: nicer and the $300 ones are way nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get into like a Dino light USB
scope, I usually use my Compost T scope
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think a bench top microscope
because I have that for tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it keeps you from needing to buy
another microscope now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're looking for Brodmites with
that sort of scope, it's helpful to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the light from below and use a light from
above and alternate between those to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to find ones hiding on the top or bottom
of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you showed up at the farm a
couple of years ago with some leaves that
[SPEAKER_01]: you said had Brodmites and I didn't
believe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got out my fancy microscope and was
shining the light from above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took probably, oh, I want to say
10, 15 minutes to actually find the mite
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaf just because they are so small
and hard to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we tried sampling a bunch of
stuff we had right there in the shop on in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how it affected or killed the
mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was amazed at how resilient those
things were.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really, you really surprised me that
day with just how tough the mites were and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that, you know, when you look at
that leaf, you wouldn't think there were
[SPEAKER_01]: mites on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looked like a new, a nutrient
deficiency or some sort of environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still, it still does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's lots of things that look
like Brodmites, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's an important thing to have a tool
to scope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you can't rule that out,
then you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you, if you can rule that
out, you know, you don't have to spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray, spray these plants that probably
just have a nutrient problem or an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're chasing after a,
if you're, if you're just doing an
[SPEAKER_00]: occasional preventative spraying or some
bio controls and you don't realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're managing a small population of
Brodmites, that can, that can be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can drastically lower your leaves for a
lot, for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we were looking for the
Brodmites and we're seeing like two,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe what, what was it like three per
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's five leaflets on a
cannabis leaf and we're seeing three per
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is all we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's enough to cause the leaves to
claw up and start to get the intervane on
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis and the pale new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people manage Brodmites at a low
population and don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think they have a virus and they
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're looking for there is sort of
a lighter twisted new green growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming it's not the genetics of that
cultivar that's known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's one, I would usually see
pale new growth and clawing or twisting or
[SPEAKER_00]: contorting of the leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in flower, the tips of the
pistil start to go brown or lots of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistil go all the way brown prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that just stop growing and look the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a definite Brodmite
symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point that you
brought up that the plant really does just
[SPEAKER_01]: stop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to change subjects, but that
reminded me of the, the one that the other
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with the nematode that you guys
came across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nemesis, I guess we could say in some
ways too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a root knot nematode and it is
the only pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only thing that's required soil
to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: After years of reusing the soil,
the nematode builds up in populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop after crop, until the yields are just
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if this, usually there's like soil
that comes out of the flowering beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: gets reused for veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it goes, if it, if it's recycled
that way in veg, the plant plants just
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will wilt quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get deficiency symptoms like
interveinal, chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the telltale sign is the nodules on
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if plants go, if plants are grown in
soil with no nematodes in it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, go into beds or pots or the fields,
whatever with nematodes, they'll still
[SPEAKER_00]: finish, but it's drastically decreased in
the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're running trials in these
different organic nematocides like
[SPEAKER_00]: melocon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these bacterial or fungal
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a Kiaha saponaria product
that we're trying and they seem to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do more controls so we can see
exactly how much it's helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know one person who brought all
the soil out of the, out of the place,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned everything up to the best of their
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow the nematodes survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had gotten some clones from that
person and I was just going to grow them
[SPEAKER_01]: out for a cloning trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had like six plants, I think it was,
and they were all in four inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I outpoured them into gallons in our
biochar soil and had them under a T5 just
[SPEAKER_01]: in a corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, I wasn't giving them
particular attention and they never looked
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I must've had them there for a month
and a half and they probably grew in
[SPEAKER_01]: another inch in that entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and I was watering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was caring for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even tried adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got to the point where I was like,
I'm never going to be able to clone these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was, well, I guess it was a
soil, but I thought it was my soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: something going on with my care for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: To throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I pulled the plant out of the,
out of the pot, I was shocked to see these
[SPEAKER_01]: giant, they look like knots in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I'll post those photos on this
podcast page so people can see what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, cause I knew at that
point that this grower had been dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with this problem, but he thought these
plants were clean and I'd been so busy
[SPEAKER_01]: with other things that I was literally
just watering them and not giving them a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more attention or my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was shocked to see just how
devastating this nematode really could be
[SPEAKER_01]: to a garden or to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nematodes, there's multiple kinds of
parasitic nematodes, plant feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, but this root knot nematode is
the one that makes these nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't live in the soil very long
before it's in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's in there, it's, there's
nothing to predate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to use these
nematocytoproducts right before transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: and watered in, ideally watered into the
soil a week or two prior and watered in at
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at whatever interval it
recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also things like mycorrhizal fungal
colonization decreases how pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: these nematodes are and trichoderma,
good trichoderma levels in the soil or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere decrease nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's university research on worm
casting tea or worm casting extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: really helping out a lot and lots of
different bacterial products that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know a lot of these bacteria or
fungi are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily that we need crazy
amounts or crazy populations of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can get all this, if we can make
sure we get the max biological diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: from the compost or castings or products
early on, that will safeguard the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this just idea of creating an
optimal environment or healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for the plant will help it
protect itself or fight off some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's not going to keep the
nematode from infecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mention, I've seen people
call them duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants that just get, they get,
they stop growing or they look deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look sick, like they have a root rot
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen these plants before in many
gardens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always look at the roots and I've
seen root nodules before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that soil leaves the leaves of
facility because I know it could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode, but it's never gotten out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen this for years occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's just nematode,
which is out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it's a different
nematode or if we just are lacking some
[SPEAKER_00]: biological diversity in the soil we had
before, but I'll keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's change subjects again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little about your
experience with reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that I know you've
worked with a lot of different people on
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've worked with growers that have
literally kept the same soil in their
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens for up to five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk a little bit more about
that process, what you're bringing the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil into beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the reamending rate or the process of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go through the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you bring, let's say, let's just start
with a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 2000 watt lights or you can talk
about what sort of other led lights would
[SPEAKER_01]: cover that space on a four by eight bed
with approximately a yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about what size the plants
are when you bring them in, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you're scrogging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know that because I've seen
some of these setups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little more about just the
process, I guess, for people who aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a four by eight bed holds right about a
yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that soil is reused, it needs
about 10 pounds of, if we're using this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pack, it takes about 10 pounds,
somewhere between seven and 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the yield, is enough to
reamend the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rate can be used for dozens of
crop cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were using some other nutrient
blend, it's similar, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar MPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to dial in, you know,
if you do soil tests, in between each
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, you can see if you're getting a
buildup or a deficiency of a certain soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral, and you can tweak the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's what you did with soil
tests over the course of a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the ratios right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just use the same nutrient blend
each crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the procedure is after harvesting,
we just pull the stumps out of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave as much root as possible,
and then till the dry nutrients end at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the top four to six inches of the
soil, just to make sure it's incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you till all the way to the bottom,
it doesn't help, and it might hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to get it into the,
you know, get at least four to six inches
[SPEAKER_00]: deep, because it needs to stay moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the top of the soil is always drying
out, and the roots are predominating in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom half of the soil, then they're
just not making contact with those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting worms up there to move
them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So incorporating or a little bit of
tilling is desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that's done, we plant back
into it the following day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely mentioned trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beds are great for trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think whether people grow indoors or
outdoors, it's the most labor-efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: way to train plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use multiple levels,
what I mean by that is horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising, and you can use multiple
layers just to make it quick and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: so the plants are always supported when
they get mature and heavy so they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: start laying on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar to what Nelson was talking
about in terms of training the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Nelson has a very similar style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plant count is up to,
it's up to your regulation first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical grow and you're
limited to lower plant counts and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to cover a certain square footage,
then that determines how many plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: have per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefit of growing more plants is you
don't spend as much time vegging the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because that takes energy and it takes
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for recreational farmers, what we call
sea of green is the most efficient way to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow where people have around one plant
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veg time is really brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really our yield is most related to our
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can build that canopy using four
plants, or eight plants in a yard of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, then we're going to maximize our
yield because we can increase our crop
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the number of crops we can get per year
out of that soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether there's one square foot per plant
or 10 square feet per plant, it should
[SPEAKER_00]: yield exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing multiple crops per
year, then smaller plants, more crop
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I want to touch on is the
way you described it's not the only way to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Goldleaf has gone to amending at a
little bit lighter levels initially,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they'll top dress with the
nutrient pack or whatever amendments you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use a little bit later on into
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say at the end of the first week of flower
and the end of the third week of flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll put a light top dressing of
nutrients on there as a way to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in the soil without risking that
soil heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got large volumes of soil,
in beds, or if you have 100-gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: 200-gallon pots, then that's a good heat
up if you mend it really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's benefits to top dressing to
spreading out the nutrient applications
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growing season rather than
just once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting all of your nitrogen in for the
entire crop cycle at once is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily optimal, but if you can get
away with it, then it saves the labor of
[SPEAKER_00]: top dressing later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're vegging in another space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be your flower room that we're
talking about right now, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to always have the flower room
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower room always has 12 hours of
light, and you want to turn as many crops
[SPEAKER_00]: per year in that flowering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a veg room that's half that
size or a third of that size to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: enough plants that cover enough square
feet that you can move them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room and click them over
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give it a few days to a week to
transition, if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it possible to, I guess,
maintain the same temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything we're doing with the
light level there in terms of that
[SPEAKER_01]: transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can go from veg to flower
immediately, if we go from the veg room to
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room and that plant goes into
flower that day, that's ideal because you
[SPEAKER_00]: get more turns per year, more crops per
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: More crop cycles per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to match the environment
pretty closely, which means similar
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, similar humidity,
similar light level, similar CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that similar CO2 level isn't as
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from atmospheric levels to elevated,
I haven't seen it cause a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But temperature, light levels,
humidity, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does your optimal flower room look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you just helped set one up the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of equipment are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you describe that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: The new optimal flower room is the one I
just did with the Fluence Vipers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 515 watt lights that cover a
three by four area, running at around 82
[SPEAKER_00]: to 84 degrees, 1500 ppm CO2, around 75%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, like beds, but you could get
away with a little less soil per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it, rather than a yard covering a
four by eight, you could do two thirds of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you'd probably find, yeah,
I'm sure you'd be fine as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: could keep it irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend most people use trough
blue mat irrigation because it works
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally mechanical, automatic
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked about blue mats really
on this podcast for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you have a lot of experience
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you describe what blue mats are?
[SPEAKER_01]: How they work, how you set them up in a
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a blue mat, it's a company called
Trough Blue Mat, which is spelled
[SPEAKER_00]: T-R-O-P-F-B-L-U-M-A-T.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an Austrian company, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out of Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Austrian company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made in Austria, Steph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tensiometer, which means it
measures the soil tension, measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a small cylinder that holds water
and it has a ceramic tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the soil dries out, it pulls a
little bit of water out of that cylinder
[SPEAKER_00]: and it turns on the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's moisture sensors that have a
little readout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push a button, it'll tell you the
moisture content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really affordable and very
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual trough blue mats open a
little valve to run the water through
[SPEAKER_00]: drippers or through a soaker hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just run off of water
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all mechanical.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no electricity being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can either run it right off of a
main line like plumbing, or you can run it
[SPEAKER_01]: off of a reservoir off of water pressure,
like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the math, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it on gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to elevate a tank,
it's really easy to go off the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to pull out of a reservoir,
if you want to add some soluble nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: through your lines, then you can get a
booster pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty affordable and I think blue
mats sell them pre-assembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it used to be where you had to have one
blue mat, which would give you one drip
[SPEAKER_01]: site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more recently, when I say more
recently, I think in the last five,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years, they added these distribution
drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have up to five drippers per
carat or per blue mat sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really, to me, was a game changer
because you can't have four or five carats
[SPEAKER_01]: in a pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make any sense for one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can run one carat with five
drip sites that completely encircle the
[SPEAKER_01]: base of the plant, covering the root zone,
now it becomes a little more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I set one up at my house with a
50 gallon reservoir and I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle all, I think I had 15 plants at the
time and it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about how
you dial them in and place them in the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just talk containers for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, let's say a 10 gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to hook the blue mat up to
a dripper, but they're around $6 or $7 for
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue mat, which is the sensor and it
drips out right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can hook up a chain of drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say up to five, which will cover
about a 16 by 24 inch area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do more than five, but you get
a bit of a loss down the chain as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do them in a spiral,
if you're doing a big pot, you can do 10
[SPEAKER_00]: drippers if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a 10 gallon pot, I'd probably do,
you could get away with just one blue mat
[SPEAKER_00]: and five drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a really deep pot, then you
might want to do a, there's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mat called maxi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have deeper than 12 inches of soil,
you want to use a maxi blue mat and a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal blue mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really recommend people grow in a
shorter, whiter pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whiter container, because that's really
the, that's how cannabis roots grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a three gallon pot, probably three
drippers, a seven gallon pot, five
[SPEAKER_00]: drippers, 10 or 12 gallon pot,
you could do two blue mats each with three
[SPEAKER_00]: to five drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much you want every inch
of the surface to be moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you dig down an inch or inch and
a half, at that point, all the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in potting soil, you know,
different soils drain differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was a little more OCD with my
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a 15 gallon pot, I ran two blue mat
sensors, just the regulars, with four drip
[SPEAKER_01]: sites on each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had eight drip points in every
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did, I did have some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know at one point I got, I flooded my
room because I didn't have one of the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in and it was just dripping and I
didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I soaked a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then I've learned that you can't
bump the main line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to put it somewhere where
you're not going to run into it because if
[SPEAKER_01]: that sensor that's pushed down into the
soil loses contact with the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll just start dripping, which is
something that you taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also once you have them dialed
in, you can pretty much just walk away,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to at least check on them and
make sure that everything is still working
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about that dialing in process
though, how you, how you dial in a sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you first plant them into the
soil, well, first you soak the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You soak the, you soak it under water for
at least a couple hours or soak it
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight and screw it together under
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no air bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you plant them into the
soil, you want to water them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in numerous quick passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is they're only going to
stick about three inches into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want the soil around it to be
saturated, as saturated as that soil gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your soil was overly dry,
especially if you're using peat moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it takes, you might not be able to
get it up to maximum saturation or field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity in over the course of an hour or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start out with moist soil and
do these quick passes of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the soil is at field
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, when you calibrate the
drippers, they're all calibrated to field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the, once the blue mats are
planted, watered in all the soils at field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, then you open them up until
water comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And close them slowly until the water
stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, it's essentially
calibrated to maintain the soil at that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's soaking wet soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you turn the screw two turns and a turn
is the space between the arrows and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make sense if you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that procedure, you set the blue
mats to hold your soil at around a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: M bar, which is, and it generally stays
between 80 and 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 M bar, which I think is the ideal
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal range in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're, say, growing in cocoa or
you're a chem grower and you're growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite, it might be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic growers usually want to keep it
a little drier and they like to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: like 120 to 160 or 140 to 180,
which is, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it still should be a little bit
more moist, but if you're, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with root pathogens and drier
might be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in, in field soil,
clay soil, then you want to keep it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit drier also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not water logging the soil,
but I've personally, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cake, the simple soil is not the
lightest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most potting soil is that the
cannabis growers buy has more aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's a heavy soil for,
for cannabis growers, but it's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: light potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use pumice, which is a big issue in
terms of the weight, but it keeps the
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite and other amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like rice holes as an aeration
amendment because they break down too
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like perlite because it floats
to the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, in fact, I haven't even told you about
this, but I found a diatomaceous earth
[SPEAKER_01]: product that looks just like perlite or
pumice, but will break down into a
[SPEAKER_01]: silicone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it vermiculites another one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a good CEC or cation exchange
capacity, but again, really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't make sense commercially,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the rock dust we're putting in
there, increase the weight of the soil as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a heavy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred M bar works great with our mix,
but people can dial that in, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: with whatever media they're using,
using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same soil, I've kept it between
60 and 80 M bar for entire crop cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got identical results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get any water stress or water
damage on the leaves or no anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, nothing slimy down there,
no rotten brown roots at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get pretty wet, but it gets
sketchier when you're running at that
[SPEAKER_00]: moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to go that moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get a moisture meter and calibrate it
to your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squeeze some soil at the same depth as the
moisture meter is stuck in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meter trains your hands to know how
much moisture is in the soil or how heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot is or how fast the soil is drying
out, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watering, I think, is the most important
thing a gardener or grower can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it gets overlooked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times when I see problems
that growers are having, a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: related to their watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of exacerbates or creates a lot of
problems and it can display as nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies and a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a system that's automated makes
a huge difference with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even the best human waterers
are going to be not only less efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not as good as a properly dialed in
blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't be shocked to say you could
get 10 to 15% better yield and growth by
[SPEAKER_01]: switching to blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least, I've seen people who
are really nerdy about watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lift every pot or they squeeze soil
in every bed and water everything
[SPEAKER_00]: differently every day and never get run
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how geeked out you are on
watering, blue mats will at least increase
[SPEAKER_00]: tricum density.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think keeping your soil evenly
moist is the best thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about living soils when
we're talking about people who want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till or just be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we didn't touch on is even
more recent than those drippers are these
[SPEAKER_01]: blue mat soaker hoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what does he call them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're made out of Tyvek
type of material and they're designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on really low pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a soaker hose for a gravity
fed type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the North American distributor for
blue mat developed this adapter so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hook the blue mat sensor directly up to
the soaker hose and it waters really
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pressure compensating essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone as far as 25 feet of the soaker
hose per blue mat and that works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do less so the blue mats are
sensing smaller zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever you want to do and it works
great outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think that stuff is around 60
cents or 80 cents a square foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on if you get a protective
jacket on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors and you have rodents or
bugs that will chew through the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you want to get a protective jacket
on it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anyone who's had a problem
with it without the jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up a good point there around the
blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I've noticed from the
manufacturer, the distributors,
[SPEAKER_01]: is some of the claims that they make
around, I think they say one blue mat and
[SPEAKER_01]: soaker hose can go like 100 feet or even
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, that isn't necessarily
the way that we like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jaya has helped me and I also do custom
blue mat setups for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So helping people set up their room
because every room is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go buy a box of blue mats
and it's going to fit your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found that, for example,
we like the regular blue mats in general
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the Maxx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you have really deep soil,
which isn't really optimal for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, you don't like to put blue mats in
the side of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there were some people taking them
and sticking them into the side of the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way of sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the side of the pot, down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the idea that you have a sensor
in the bottom of the soil and a sensor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, but it just never worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of the soil is just always more
moist and yeah, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with these soaker hoses,
you found that certain layouts are more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, you don't want to go
beyond 25 feet per sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't even go that far depending
on the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can spiral them or you can weave
them throughout the plants just to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: get even coverage across the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they take corners really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's an application for the
fittings that take corners, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They meander really well and I like to
have them spaced about six inches on
[SPEAKER_00]: center or eight inches on center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to make sure that the soaker
hose spirals back towards the sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: is about three inches or four inches away
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the soaker hose is irrigating,
it's going to moisten the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: activate that sensor at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want it on top of the sensor,
but not too far away from the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some of the subtleties of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you understand how it works,
it's intuitive the way it goes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put up a bunch of photos and links
too for people that go to the podcast page
[SPEAKER_01]: so they can read more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, this is something that we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do help people with setting up the
Fluence lighting and the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something they can contact us
directly for if they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like we covered a lot so far
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's more I want to talk about,
but maybe I could have you back on to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more about soil here in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then good talking to you, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_01]: blog at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
