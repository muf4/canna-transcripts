[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by flushing, I don't mean removing a
bunch of nutrients from the soil at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the flower cycle as a way of
improving the quality of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a hydro concept and doesn't
apply to organic living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say flushing, what I'm talking
about is running a bunch of water through
[SPEAKER_00]: the media, through our soil, as a way of
reducing levels of certain nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: have gotten excessive either over time or
due to your amendments or inputs over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically associated on tests with
soil sodium, chloride, or nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium is not an essential mineral for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need it and it will cause plant
stress and potentially raise the EC or
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble salt level of the soil creating
osmotic pressure in the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will stress your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep those levels as low as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically sodium comes in with water,
fermented plant extracts, teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come in with a bunch of seed-based
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that you want to
monitor and will show up on your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorides, plants only need a small
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically associate this with water,
but you can see it in high levels with
[SPEAKER_00]: some amendments and other things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly is nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of tests with really high
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pretty common because people
want to feel like they're feeding their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and they want to feel like they're
contributing to their plant growing
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than leave a good thing alone,
they add more teas, whether that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea, a fermented plant extract,
whatever kind of tea, nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all bringing in nitrogen in
some level, most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those nitrates are going to cause,
high levels of nitrates are going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive inner node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the distance between your nodes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can get really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll typically see excessively green
plants and that clawing of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're opening yourself up to more
pest and pathogen pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're reducing your yields
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by flushing that bed and removing
the nitrates, you should see a dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in the quality of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about flushing and
how to flush, what we're going to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to run a whole bunch of very
clean water that's not high in sodium or
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorides through our soil, typically at
10 or 20% of the total volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorides are a little harder to move out
than sodium is, but we want to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: flush that stuff out, retest, see how our
levels have dropped and then re-amend any
[SPEAKER_00]: essential plant minerals that might have
been flushed out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's way too common that we
see tests where we have to recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you're not going to make
it through the cycle if you don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that we're not going to be
quite as optimal as we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that you want to manage
with your inputs and with the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your water over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope that helps explain it and thanks
for checking it out.
See you next time.
