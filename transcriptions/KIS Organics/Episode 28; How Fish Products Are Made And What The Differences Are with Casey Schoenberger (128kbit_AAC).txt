[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost a year now since we
launched the podcast and I want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone for all the positive feedback and
support I've received.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some amazing guests in the works
and can't wait to share the information
[SPEAKER_00]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also hoping to add some more
educational videos and blogs to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website in the coming months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, if you want to stay up to
date with everything we are up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can subscribe to our newsletter on our
homepage at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise we won't share your information
and won't blow up your inbox with emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get on with today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Casey Schoenberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey is the Director of Sales for DRAM's
Corporations Fertilizer and Farm Segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: DRAM produces dramatic fish hydrolysate
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, he and his wife Shelly
operate Happy Little Farm in Conway,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, growing a variety of fruits,
vegetables, and nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought him on to educate us on fish
hydrolysate and other fish products.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between fish
hydrolysate and fish emulsion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And much, much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Casey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we give listeners a little bit of your
background into how you got into farming
[SPEAKER_00]: and specifically more of these fish
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a funny story, taking me from my
home and leading me back to my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up in Wisconsin and went to
college there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was in college, I came out
here to where I'm currently living in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came out to study killer whales out
in the San Juan Islands just off of north
[SPEAKER_01]: of Seattle and loved it out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ended up sticking around in the area
and getting into teaching environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: education and got really into that,
really enjoyed that, and kind of found a
[SPEAKER_01]: calling, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led me into really looking at the
environmental side of our food systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: diving in deep on that, trying to figure
out how we're going to grow food in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future so that we're not harming future
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That led me to spending a year on a
permaculture farm out there called
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullock's Permaculture Farm, where I
learned a lot of sustainable living
[SPEAKER_01]: skills, a lot about growing food,
and just honestly really nerded out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: stack of books from the library next to my
bed every night and learning everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: could about growing fruits, vegetables,
nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then left there, my wife and I moved
back to her family's farm where she grew
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up buying a 20-acre chunk
from her parents and started doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: community-supported agriculture farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately planted everything we
could, so every fruit, nut, and vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can grow in the climate,
which is, for your listeners, a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that there's always something
to do outside and also a really good way
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that you never turn a profit
trying to be so diversified.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our pantry always looks amazing,
and it's really fun and educational,
[SPEAKER_01]: just probably not the greatest business
plan in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we continue to do something like that
in some form every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of work trade because we both
work off the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that led me, I went back and
visited my family in Wisconsin and ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up bringing my wife and kids to take a
tour of this fertilizer plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: this organic fertilizer plant I had heard
about that's just five minutes from my
[SPEAKER_01]: parents' house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of near Green Bay,
Wisconsin, right on Lake Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the two or not really knowing
what I was getting into and watched the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of this recycling of fish scraps
that we'll get into more here on this call
[SPEAKER_01]: and got to the end of it and just said,
wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are taking a waste stream source
and making this incredible fertilizer out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is five minutes from where I grew
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to the end and they actually
mentioned that they're looking to hire
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody out in the Seattle area to work
with the Alaskan fisheries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up knowing about DRAM because my
parents owned a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I think of DRAM, I think of
sprayers and I think of hoses and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk a little bit about what
DRAM overall as a corporation does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know they have hands in a lot of
different aspects of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm right with you where I had
worked at a nursery as the edible food,
[SPEAKER_01]: the edible plant specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I knew DRAM as is anything
that you screw onto the end of a hose has
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM's name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water wands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the company actually started like 80
years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we celebrated our 75th anniversary just
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool company created or started in
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flagship invention was the water
breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're familiar with that, the screen
that softens the water spray so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't trample your flowers when you're
watering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's still what a lot of people
know DRAM for is, you know, go into any
[SPEAKER_01]: floriculture greenhouse or anything and
what you screw onto the end of a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM also developed a line of home
gardener tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you go into an independent garden
center and you'll see big colorful racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprinklers and hoses and stuff you screw
on to the hoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our commercial division that I
was just describing does, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you build a greenhouse, we do pretty
much we can do pretty much everything
[SPEAKER_01]: after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fan layout, the irrigation systems
known a lot for really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayers, chemical applicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do the hoses and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another division that deals with
it's our newest division dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: water purification systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using ozone, the more high capital
projects and just the coolest company to
[SPEAKER_01]: work for where, you know, family owned and
nobody ever leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The joke is, you know, nobody ever leaves
the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people have been there for 20,
30 years and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a long way of saying about 20
years ago, the owner of the company,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kurt DRAM started using a fish fertilizer
in Wisconsin and was amazed at his little,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, his small hobby garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He built a greenhouse at the results he
was seeing, you know, just on plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: cyclamen and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to the, to the plant and took
a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time it was pretty run down
and open tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was near the high school,
near the high school that I actually went
[SPEAKER_01]: to and ended up buying the plant and
buying a building and really making
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, state of the art as
far as fish fertilizer goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really proud of our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've just recently invested in a lot
more storage so that we can age the
[SPEAKER_01]: product longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get into that a little bit more
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we've been doing the fish
fertilizer thing for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reason a lot of existing DRAM customers
don't know about it is we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do a lot of the other DRAM business for
indoor growing the floriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fish fertilizer just naturally
fits a lot more in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sell a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 5,000 gallon tanker loads to outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get into that on scale
affordability and some of the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: around application methods and rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can we just talk a little bit more
about the process itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people have heard of fish
fertilizer, but that carries a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that falls into a lot of different
categories and many people aren't aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the two big ones in terms
of liquids, when we talk about liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, would be emulsion or
hydrolysate or hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking before the podcast and you
said it could be pronounced either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you describe sort of that process
in terms of how emulsion is made and how
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate is made?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can look into some of the ways
that they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a common question, like you said,
and especially when I started,
[SPEAKER_01]: emulsions were around more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it as much, especially on the
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you still go into a box store,
there's going to be a fish emulsion on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fish emulsions are a thicker material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're always lower price tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's always attractive,
usually less than half the price of a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The emulsions, as far as I know,
are usually made from Manhattan,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's some concerns there with
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I say that knowing there's
probably some other emulsions on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market that aren't made from that source.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, as far as I know,
the emulsions, they'll remove proteins and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big one for us is the
hydrolysates will usually have a good fish
[SPEAKER_01]: oil content in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that that's very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you get at the end with the
emulsions is a thicker material that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be higher in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's obviously something that growers
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a cheaper fertilizer that's
usually an analysis of something like
[SPEAKER_01]: 5-1-1, so 5% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus,
and 1% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the hydrolysate, our hydrolysate,
our base is a 2-5-0.2, so 2% nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% phos, 0.2% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're a little bit higher in phos than
some other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those in general are pretty close to
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you might ask, why would you buy
the hydrolysate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is hydrolysate more popular than the
emulsion?
[SPEAKER_01]: The big difference is we're not heating it
up and removing all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you have is this low-heat
process where the vitamins, the proteins,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amino acids are not broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the general thought is that the
hydrolysates feed beneficial fungus and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that more than 50% of our
business is customers not buying on NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely not buying on nitrogen
per dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just never the case with
hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're usually buying is this
incredible food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can get into this later,
but a lot of times our fish will be sold
[SPEAKER_01]: right with some sort of biological
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're familiar with the bugs in
a bottle idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big industry of folks trying to isolate
the good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost tea would be a way of doing that
by yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's plenty of companies that
are really trying to isolate a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: really good bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would sell that along with our
fish to help multiply it once it goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant or on your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely want to talk about that
aspect of it, that microbial side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you just explain a little bit
about how emulsion is just how it's made?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned high heat in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then typically this menhaden type
fish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been in an emulsion factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm a little bit hesitant to go on
record telling you how it's made.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, what I've been told is that
you're using ocean fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're heating to extract the oils and the
proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that oil will be sold off
separately for cosmetic industry and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, protein is removed for
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have this thicker liquid left
at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a waste product of a waste
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I tell people, if you're
looking for a cheap source of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, try to make sure it's an actual
organic emulsion, that they're using an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic process and not throwing something
else in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually if it's a 511 or a 411,
definitely not a bad source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to be as good of a
microbial food source as a hydraulic it
will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in my experience and also this is a
lot of the work from Tim Wilson of
[SPEAKER_00]: Microorganics was that when you start
using these fish products, emulsion or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate in compost teas, the emulsion
would actually inhibit microbial growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the hydrolysate is one of the best
fungal foods out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it feeds the bacteria as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a good growth with the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, it's an excellent fungal
food, which there's not a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: ones out there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a decent sized compost tea brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that idea of if you're going to use
your compost tea on your orchard where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going for a higher fungal
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've definitely heard it both ways of
whether to add the hydrolysate at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning or wait until the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's interesting about the
inhibition on the emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of surprises me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and this was over a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to totally go on record
there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that there is quite a
dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can confidently say that between
hydrolysate and emulsion from microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective with hydrolysate being far
superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you did mention adding it at the end
of a brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say Tim Wilson did a lot of
research on this and found that if you add
[SPEAKER_00]: fish hydrolysate at the end of a high
quality compost tea brew, you can drop
[SPEAKER_00]: your dissolved oxygen levels within
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much, much better to add at the
beginning or use it as a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: application from a compost tea
perspective, at least what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: when we use a dissolved oxygen meter and a
microscope to evaluate the quality of a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I mentioned the dram water
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're seeing a lot is the main
idea at the beginning was a good effective
[SPEAKER_01]: way to clean water using the ozone.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's come out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, of course, knew dissolved oxygen
is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no idea how good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so studies and a lot of the anecdotal
evidence coming out of these greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on extremely high levels of
dissolved oxygen in their water,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as Eidlings doing way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the inhibition of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that pathogens love anaerobic
environments and they don't like high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that benefit of high levels of
dissolved oxygen has become incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one other key difference, I believe,
is that the emulsion tends to have a much
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just opened your bottle of hydrolysis
the same way you gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it definitely smells like fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no denying that, but it's not
overwhelming, though I don't have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of smell either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that emulsion is a much
stronger odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used the emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I used an
emulsion, obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm not going out and buying fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I literally have our product on my
face right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just outside getting a dose on our
vegetables and I can be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: clumsy when I'm in a hurry and add some
splash up on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what we like to say is it smells
like fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't smell like rotten
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kirk Graham told me,
you know, right off the bat, it smells
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ocean breeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that description.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it shouldn't smell like rotten
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard people say that emulsions
are a little bit more of an offensive
[SPEAKER_01]: odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good part about it, especially using
it outdoors, it literally goes away by the
[SPEAKER_01]: next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so your neighbors, you know,
people in suburban areas using it on
[SPEAKER_01]: lawns, you can definitely smell it for a
couple hours, but it goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard, you know, some people
will add if the smell is really a concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses can actually act as a masking
agent for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've experimented a little bit with like
peppermint oil and that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just, you know, it smells like fishy
peppermint, which I don't know that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelled that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked a little bit about
emulsion, but let's talk a focus really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick on how hydrolysate is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you make this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make this product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because it's pretty simple and
I'll get into what the complicated part
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple, but I wouldn't recommend
starting your own plant because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: complications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take scrap from the fishing
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking all wild fish scrap after
they take the fillet off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to us for DRAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to us that we get
some of the gut material that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural enzymes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a, just a cool synergistic thing
with nature is that those, those enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fish guts help break, break down
the fish for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is obtaining scrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, it's almost all completely
from the five great lakes, the fishing
[SPEAKER_01]: industry on the five great lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring them into our plant in totes,
grind them up, and then we'll digest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point we're adding an acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the hydrolysates use an acid at
that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer to use phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more expensive than the
alternative, which would be sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, a lot of people ask how,
how we can use phosphoric or sulfuric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, seeing as though on their own,
they're not considered organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the National Organic Standards
Board made a ruling that it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to make fish fertilizer,
that fish fertilizer is a necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient for organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to have a stabilizing aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're allowed to use enough of it to
get it pH stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the key here, Tad,
is that what, what we're really doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: pickling fish guts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not unlike, you know, your grandma
making vinegar, pickle and putting them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pantry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're grinding, digesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're letting it sit in the tank with
the acid and digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we run it through an emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a key for DRAM is that we have an
incredible amount of storage tanks where
[SPEAKER_01]: we can age the product longer and really
let those fine bits of bone break down and
[SPEAKER_01]: get into the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, that's a big one for us is
we end up with almost always 1% of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a little bit rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other companies will filter
those, filter that bone out and sell that
[SPEAKER_01]: as a separate product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've seen fish bone meal,
a powder floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, that would be that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get that into the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that give you phosphorus as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know fish bone meal tends to be
high in P. Yep.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish bone, it would be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that helps us get to that 5%
phosphorus number.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some, some hydrolysis that are
made from like a product of a fish that
[SPEAKER_01]: are more like cartilage based.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, that would, I've seen numbers that's
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd see like a two, three,
one again, 2% nitrogen, 3% phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then at the, at the very end,
we're, we're screening it and blending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's, what's pretty cool about
our place is you, you go in and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: left at the end, you know, the,
the, the, the solids that come out at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end because we're aging it so long is not
much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like for how much fertilizer
comes out of our factory, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see a couple of 55 gallon drums of
solids at the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a combination of the enzymes
and the fish guts and then the acid
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down those solids and getting
them down to where they can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: through a 200 mesh screen twice before we
ship it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so I got at the point of that
is a fairly simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard part, Ted, is we're taking
something that I just said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeds, beneficial biology like nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're trying to stabilize it so
we can put it in the little bottles and
[SPEAKER_01]: ship it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally we sell it all over the world
and sometimes it doesn't get used for six
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the tricky part is we're
trying to take this, this extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: bioactive product and stabilize it for
this moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all about hitting this
correct pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other factors besides pH,
you know, as far as getting it stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so I understand it, you get in all
of these fish guts and fish carcasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially this byproduct, it goes into a
giant tank or multiple tanks and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoric acid is added first as a way of
establishing a pH, a target pH that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise we would end up smelling like
the emulsion you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're not pH stabilizing that early
in the process, you're gonna start to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a putrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you hit this pH and then that sort
of stabilizes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, you're,
you say you emulsified, so you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the natural enzymes in the fish
are breaking down all the organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would say that the carcasses
themselves over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, are you
re-stabilizing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really the whole steps to the
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do need to check.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, we do check before it goes out
the door to make sure it's within the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters, the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality control pH parameters,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere in between 3.5 and 4 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if we do need to, rather than
adjusting, we'll do like blending if we
[SPEAKER_01]: ever do have a problem there, where we're
up above where we wanna be or in that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times there's wiggle room
there as far as being above four,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd probably still be all right since we
really prefer to have it in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there shouldn't be any real microbes
coming in on it at that point because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the high acidity, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what allows it to stay stable
in the bottle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, except there is some life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're good on, the good news is that pH
range kills the really bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So salmonella, E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some life if we stick it
under a microscope, but not enough life to
[SPEAKER_01]: make say a 275 gallon tote below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which if you talk to people, veterans of
the fish fertilizer industry, everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: got a story, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of something getting away from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times that happens more often
with the sulfuric acid products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the reason we don't like to
use the cheaper sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reaction going on between the
fish bone or any of the solids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, where as that bone gets broken down,
the pH will rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we use sulfuric acid,
that tends to happen faster or less
[SPEAKER_01]: predictably, I guess would be the best way
to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'd be more likely to have a pH
shoot up when you don't want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer your question, some of this
is a little bit unknown to us of what
[SPEAKER_01]: exact parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're constantly logging and trying
to learn more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people really aren't making their own
fish hydrolysate at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be making it more of a fish
emulsion, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to take fish and grind it up
and then apply it to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's essentially an emulsion,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, except I don't know that... I mean,
you're emulsifying fish, so I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: could stick a trout in my Vitamix here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would technically be an emulsified
trout.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether that would actually be what on
the market is sold as fish emulsion,
[SPEAKER_01]: because in that case, there is a heating
process and stuff removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I have seen some YouTube videos
of some guys making homemade.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've recommended to people is,
because it does happen where somebody gets
[SPEAKER_01]: a line on, say, a university doing studies
on fish and having these fish carcasses
[SPEAKER_01]: that they need to dispose of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Bullock's Permaculture Farm
where I live, they had a great story about
[SPEAKER_01]: that where they had a line on all the
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I do recommend is compost
it, hot compost it, if you have the means
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, get a lot of good carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I remember that story from 20 years
ago, there was that they buried it all in
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost pile and then somebody forgot
about it and went and tried to move it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the tractor loader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not much worse smells than
that of anaerobic rotten fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to keep it aerated,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and wild animals are going to go
crazy for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as someone who's hoping to get into
fishing here as a personal hobby as I get
[SPEAKER_00]: older, I have heard of people taking those
fish guts and burying them right into
[SPEAKER_00]: their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native Americans used to put them under
their, I believe under their corn or
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato plants and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can definitely use fish in those
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much information online.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can go read about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is important to, I think,
differentiate that hydrolysate is a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different product that you're not
making it at home, I guess, is the point I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get across to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you touched on was shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a good shelf life for these
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to worry about that when we're
buying them from, say, a garden center?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to put a shelf life on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just because that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people who think that there's
actually a continual breakdown going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that that's true as far as
the microscopic solids that make it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the 200 mesh screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would feel perfectly comfortable if
I found out of my barn an old bottle from
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years ago when I started working for
DRAM using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I say it, like I've said it a
couple of times already, is treat it like
[SPEAKER_01]: you would a jar of pickles that you made,
a jar of vinegar pickles that you made
[SPEAKER_01]: that you found in your pantry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just ate some spicy pickled
asparagus from 2015 yesterday,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it tasted just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's pH stabilized, nothing should
be happening in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is an advantage of the
hydrolysate versus some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: biological amenities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a 50 gallon drum right now
at my farm that we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows how old it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be two to five years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know quite what I'm going to do
with it yet, but it didn't have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just going to use my nose sort of
as a guide there and hopefully still use
[SPEAKER_00]: it on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that wouldn't be uncommon
there, Ted, is for you to look down into
[SPEAKER_01]: that drum and see some white mold on the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that's been tested, it's a simple
bread mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, if you want to be really
careful, you would actually get it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times what that would be is a
very simple, safe bread mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you just need to filter that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would feel I would feel OK using
that personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I don't worry too much about
these sorts of things when I'm applying
[SPEAKER_00]: them to ornamentals or to soil directly,
because I think that nature kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: handles a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now spraying it directly onto my finished
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or my crops is probably something I
wouldn't recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you just have to look at different
materials and treat them differently
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on all these circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit about how fish
hydrolysis is made and the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between that and emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the
quality and the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not trying to throw you under the
bus regarding other companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've heard you know, there's a bunch
of companies out there making this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just to throw some names out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic Gem, Neptune's Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one close to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other companies making fish
hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are putting in, you know,
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting in kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of some putting in crustacean
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just talk a little bit about the
other differences, I guess, across these
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies besides, like,
maybe the species of the fish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all the exact same process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, it's a tough spot for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I can really speak about is
our process, you know, and what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that I've kind of went in depth on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there's a difference between
ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: A difference is ocean fish versus our fish
from the Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just because a place is on the coast
doesn't necessarily mean that it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ocean fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know that that's a conclusion
you want to draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I think that pretty much is
the case that the ones that the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned on the coast are using ocean
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to see higher sodium levels
in fish drawn from saltwater versus
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do they wash them so thoroughly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not retained in the flesh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's going to be harmed,
you know, at the levels that you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: fish unless you're, you know, we do have
some growers who really dive in and use,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, over 100 gallons per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hop growers really like our
fertilizer a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them will use extremely high
volumes of it to the point where if we had
[SPEAKER_01]: higher sodium levels in ours, that would
be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're in the, you know,
Eastern Washington, you know, near where
[SPEAKER_01]: we live on the other side of the mountains
where there's just not enough rainfall to
[SPEAKER_01]: wash out that sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were using extremely high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have a recent comparison of
our lake fish versus ocean fish of whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really a big difference in sodium
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as process, I can't speak to that
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can always look at the NPK and
get an idea from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I said the lower phosphorus
levels, it's possible that the bone is
[SPEAKER_01]: being pulled out earlier and sold as a
separate product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would ask if you think calcium is
important, like I do in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most crops or all crops, especially like
apple growers in Eastern Washington trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to prevent bitter pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, hey, if you're buying somebody
else's fish, just ask them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lab analysis showing what their
calcium is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we're proud of in ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm trying to think of, oh,
and then, yeah, you hit on it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do several different blends with ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a fish, a fish and kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a fish, kelp, fulvic and humic
acid product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also will dissolve sodium
nitrate or Chilean nitrate into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our blends to get a 4% or 5% nitrogen
product that has a quick release organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen source, along with that slow
release, sorry, we have the quick release
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate nitrogen source in the Chilean
nitrate that's still certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that slower release nitrogen from
the other 2% of the nitrogen and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: really like that combination, especially,
you know, like I said, I was just out
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizing vegetables here in the Skagit
Valley where the soil takes forever to
[SPEAKER_01]: warm up, you know, on three feet above sea
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting that little bit of nitrate
into those plants as they're popping up
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the spring is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things, you know,
as far as different blends that the
[SPEAKER_01]: companies make would be a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit on it at the beginning is if
you're asking, making sure you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a hydrolysis if one of your goals is to
really amp up your biology and your
[SPEAKER_01]: organic system, you're already,
you know, starting out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're just, you really should
be thinking of emulsions and hydrolysis as
[SPEAKER_01]: two very different things, not as all
being fish fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so start with the idea that
hydrolysis are gonna be superior in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of ways to emulsions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things, like you said,
is there's different ones that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in different ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important that people
look further into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, and again, this is not a comment
on any particular product in general or
[SPEAKER_00]: company, but I've seen some, they're
adding biochar, which on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't know the quality of the
biochar and we don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sort of stuff that as a
grower, I would wanna look further into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't actually know the answer to
these questions in those particular
[SPEAKER_00]: products, but that's what I would wanna
know before I started really getting heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: into applying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with, you know, even the kelp or
the crustacean to find out sort of what
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are gonna be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know getting something on a
label versus putting enough in to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make a noticeable change in your crop can
be very different based on the bureaucracy
[SPEAKER_00]: around the fertilizer industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I wanna touch on too
is you mentioned that your product sits a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot longer than maybe traditionally done
by some of these other hydrolysis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I would look into
when I'm trying to determine quality of a
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some things, some pointers for
listeners to maybe think about as they
[SPEAKER_00]: consider using fish products in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I wanted to touch on
that I know is a little tricky for you
[SPEAKER_00]: too, is just the idea that when you look
at a bottled nutrient, an organic bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient product, whether it's a bottled
nutrient line from pretty much any company
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in the cannabis industry,
if they list fish on the label,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I understand it, it's most likely fish
hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really tough for me to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I know that we do work
with some of those companies sending
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients over, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But very difficult for me to answer
whether some of them are using emulsion
[SPEAKER_01]: and what, you know, the labeling laws are
so tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm sure you know is like each
state has different regulations to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where it's not even legally possible
to have the same fertilizer label you have
[SPEAKER_01]: in Oregon, the same label you have in
California where the requirements are at
[SPEAKER_01]: odds with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as what you're required to
list on there, and I think some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, so I'm very lucky in that I am not
the person that DRAM has to deal with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thank our friend Tim Daly for being the
one who has to jump through those hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're using, you know,
as you're alluding to, if they're adding
[SPEAKER_01]: such a small amount of some of this stuff
where they're just trying to put it on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually omit some of that from
the label is my understanding in some
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, the best thing to do is to
ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case, it's a little bit harder
to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was going to say about
comparing the fish fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times or usually in our case,
it's sold through district distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit trickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times our distributors will
send customers straight to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I'm proud of the way we
make our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be my advice for your
listeners is ask, you know, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying from a certain label and they're
obviously not a fish fertilizer producer
[SPEAKER_01]: is send them an email and say,
hey, whose fish fertilizer are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they might, they probably won't
give you the answer to that, but is it
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrolysis or is it an emulsion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at the very least they can tell you
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the labeling laws are a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, I've been working on
our California label now for a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's been terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here in Washington, I can call us
kiss organics, but in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't unless all of our products are
certified for use in organic or
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture by them, which I totally get
because it can be misleading to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're just very, they're very strict
in terms of what they allow and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't accept armory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't accept WSDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's been really eyeopening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, with your product being
a two five zero point two in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, you could actually have a 5%
nitrogen or 10% phosphorus in theory on
[SPEAKER_00]: the label or on your, on your tests,
but you don't have to declare that on your
[SPEAKER_00]: actual label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is crazy, you know, and that gets
into, you and I could go on for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to get too into it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's crazy that, you know,
because there's laws in some places about
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus fertilizers because of runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's my understanding that you
can put down a zero for phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though you have 5% phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get around those, to get around the
labeling laws that are supposed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to prevent people from dumping
too much on their lawns and having it go
[SPEAKER_01]: into their, the lake next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, some of it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fight through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, it probably is a whole nother
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I just want to encourage people
to really look into the sourcing and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use that as a guide for determining
quality when they're evaluating different
[SPEAKER_00]: products in general, not just,
not just fish products, but let's get back
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of the aspects of applying these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a liquid, it's a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be mixing it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about
application rates and methods for applying
[SPEAKER_00]: fish hydrolysate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the big advantages for me is
that fish fertilizer is used in so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it, it, there is no one size fits
all, or this is how much to use and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the way to put it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a strength of, of our fertilizer
and most liquid organic fertilizers is
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of ways to put them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I will get into some of the
obstacles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can apply it straight on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply it on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way I really like for, especially for
larger growers is dripping it on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the seed at planting, getting back to
what we talked about, about its ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you can put your,
your mind there on that seed popping up
[SPEAKER_01]: and having that, what I call the fungal
force field, you know, that does beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: bright white mycelium helping protect that
plant from, from pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, but we do have a lot of growers who
use it as a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get anecdotal reports of fungicidal
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some studies of fish
products going back on my blueberries
[SPEAKER_01]: showing some, you know, fungicidal
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know whether it's oils
preventing those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whether it's more just promoting
biodiversity and creating an environment
[SPEAKER_01]: in which pathogens aren't interested in,
in thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, getting off topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as application rates in general,
a lot of folks will use it not as their
[SPEAKER_01]: primary source of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll be using some sort of dry
fertilizer or cover crop in that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, two to five gallons per acre
per application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the five gallons more for like orchards
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the most common rates would be a
two gallons per acre per application,
[SPEAKER_01]: three times during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really common one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you get into cost on that,
say, say you're buying the fertilizer for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for five or six bucks a gallon,
you're not talking about a big investment
[SPEAKER_01]: to add into your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about acreage right
now, a lot of our guys, maybe let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: they had, a small, small garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're maybe applying it by the gallon
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding like what, like maybe an
ounce or so per gallon or less?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're getting into dilution rates,
the two most common dilution rates would
[SPEAKER_01]: be a 20 parts water to one part
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably, that's the most common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks prefer a 50 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of cases though, it comes down
to, you know, I've had it here where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling a lot for work and I miss I'm
only able to get my one application in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go for a stronger fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be using a stronger amount and a
stronger dilution ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not at all scared to get down to
10 to one with our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would even go stronger dilution rate
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some experiments here trying to,
you know, just using a backpack sprayer
[SPEAKER_01]: going with them because the concern,
the next question would usually be how low
[SPEAKER_01]: can I go or how strong of a, of a dilution
ratio can I go before I start burning
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to like three to one on our
product that has the sodium nitrate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a little bit of brown spots on
some broccoli, you know, but that was
[SPEAKER_01]: where it looked like straight fish
fertilizer coming out of the end of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, end of the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the versatility, so, so in,
in, but in some cases folks will,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll do five, seven applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're already going out with
your tractor, the fish is really
[SPEAKER_01]: compatible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and in fact can work as a spreader
sticker, um, for other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people just like to mix a
little bit of fish in their tank with just
[SPEAKER_01]: about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because of the phosphoric acid,
you want to avoid using it with calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure you've, sure you've heard
that, you know, those two, two guys don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you'll have a precipitate,
um, fallout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you pHing the solution at all
prior to application?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I don't, you know, so,
so we're, it's going to come out of our
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle at a 3.5 to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then by the time you dilute that,
it pops up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's not an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of times, a lot of your
listeners have, have programs and ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: test that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't even get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I sell, you know, uh,
I sell a lot through distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I don't end up working directly
with, with those growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about growers in Eastern
Washington that have a lot of calcium in
[SPEAKER_00]: their water already?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to treat that prior to using
that water without application?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully the people that have high
calcium water is already know how to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're really fortunate here,
uh, in the, in the Western Washington to
[SPEAKER_00]: not have, we have wonderful water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's one of the best things
about living here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned a little bit about
affordability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you threw out some numbers,
like, uh, I think you said seven to $8 a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that sounds low to me, but so you must
be talking about buying on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where you get into the single
digits when you're, when you're going 55
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon drums or larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the listeners for your
podcast are going to be, that's a decision
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the two points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so our next size lower than a 55
gallon drum is a five gallon size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's two, two and a half gallon
jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we decided to go with
rather than the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really like the convenience of
those, the fact that you can just pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: a two, 2.5 gallon jug and shake it,
you know, and, um, get it nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: agitated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think where you're going with the
question and where, where, where,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the big question is, is it worth it to
scale up to a 55 gallon drum that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to get shipped on a, on a, on a semi,
um, that's going to weigh 600 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you're going to pay about a third
of the price per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so if you're going to go through
that much, and then another big advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: of fish hydrolysis is that if you could
use half that drum in one season and then
[SPEAKER_01]: use the rest the next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, watch for,
you know, whether bread mold will grow on
[SPEAKER_01]: it in between, you know, if you're not
using it for, for seven months,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just check on those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what you'd be looking at is
saving that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say $5, five to $6 per gallon and the
55 gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm using vague numbers, um,
for a couple of reasons is it depends,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how close it is to you with the
shipping and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also, um, we sell several
different blends that are all different
[SPEAKER_01]: price points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the more, more extra amendments
we put in the higher the price gets,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then you'd be getting up to say 15,
16, $17 a gallon in, in the 2.5 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that gives you a good idea of the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course we saw, we saw gallons
and quarts and all of that too,
[SPEAKER_01]: for even smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times that's the big decision
a grower has to make is should I save the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money on the 55 gallon drum?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I got to use a paint mixer on the
end of a power drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have a 55 gallon drum
pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but those are all the considerations
to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and the more frugal growers,
you know, we'll, we'll go ahead and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: 55 gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes growers will just say,
I, I don't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I'm looking forward to talking to
Kurt Becker about, uh, applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying and he's a genius in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he works for DRAM as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the opportunity to meet him last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's, he knows that stuff inside and
out of, uh, of what you, what the best
[SPEAKER_01]: solution is for your problem in your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll, we'll dive into spraying and,
and all of that a little more with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you did mention drip systems as being
a little bit problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if you had talked about
them yet on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'd mentioned drip systems as being
a little bit problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where I was going to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, that's the big question we get
is, can I put your stuff through our drip
[SPEAKER_01]: system?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and it's going to,
the answer to that is going to depend a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit on what type of drip system you
have, how long you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some people will bury their lines and want
to keep them for several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my answer, my first answer is I don't
put it through drip at my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend if you can put it on any
other way than putting it through a drip
[SPEAKER_01]: system, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you still get people growers where
their system is just not going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: another way to get it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so if you're going to use it to
drip and lots of people do, and this would
[SPEAKER_01]: be for our fish, I draw us it,
or for any liquid organic fertilizer is
[SPEAKER_01]: you just have to be vigilant about
flushing with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I recommend you occasionally
using some sort of organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: biocide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you gotta make sure you're
sticking on label, you know, with things
[SPEAKER_01]: like, um, with oxidator, Sanidate,
or the, um, I'm hesitant to even say it on
[SPEAKER_01]: a podcast because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, things would be allowed
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some enzyme products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with there's something EF
300, a guy in California makes that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard great things about, and I might have
the name of that product wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've had Chris Jagger on the
podcast and I think, uh, Chris would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the go-to for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's got an enzyme product that he
really likes for eating up living stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's your concern is I'll say it
again, nothing feeds beneficial fungus and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a fish hydrolysis, but sometimes it
feeds those in places you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the inside of your drip
line, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So algae growth and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to avoid that biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a larger, let's say you're
putting it through piping that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: reach your finger into, if it feels slimy
or anything like that, that's that biofilm
[SPEAKER_00]: created by the, uh, biology that's eating
as a food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what that one pad is a really
good place to go with Kirk Becker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows a lot, you know, that's,
that's where our ozone systems are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our, our, our big on, um, you know,
it's a common problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get rid of that biofilm in our,
um, irrigation system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something he's really dove into
coming up with solutions for growers on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much I didn't even think about
when it came to spring that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, Suzanne's always saying,
stop using paint sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he really explains what the
difference is in terms of the actual size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the molecule or drip that you're
applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed his presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, uh, let's see for you, the other,
the other question I had then was,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you use like a, so for example,
at my house here, I just put in a new lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: of sod and I was going to take the sample
you gave me and put it through a hose and
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer as a way to get it out onto the,
onto the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what do you think of something like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we even sell, you know, like the,
the small retail bottles with that hose
[SPEAKER_01]: and sprayer thing attached to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so that works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that I've done here is,
are you familiar with DRAM actually sells
[SPEAKER_01]: the Siphonject?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's kind of the next step down
from like the smallest Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's just this incredibly simple
technology, a little Venturi, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: injector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take that little, you can look on
the internet for a DRAM Siphonject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're less than $20 and,
uh, it's got a little hose line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you can do it a couple of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing you need to make sure is
that you're following all the rules on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make absolute certain that
you're, um, pulling the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fertilizer out of the bottle at the
right dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now for our product, it doesn't really
matter that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing, you know, you're not
going to be, especially for how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pulling it out at twice the
dilution rate, it doesn't really matter
[SPEAKER_01]: that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm getting at is you would,
um, you could either put it on the front
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hose or the back of the hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back at the spigot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put the little hose thing,
um, down into your fertilizer bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, um, screw that onto the spigot and
then you screw the hose onto that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit difficult to
describe over the phone here, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, then if you start spraying with your,
with your hose and go through a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: water wand, um, and you are pulling an
exact dilution ratio, I'm pretty sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So incredibly simple technology of a
injector that, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: plugging it into an outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at my house, we have, I'm on city
water, so there's chlorine in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm going to apply things like
this, uh, fish hydrolysate, the dramatic K
[SPEAKER_00]: here that you gave me and things like
seaweed extract powder through my hose and
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer, because I'm not applying anything
that really has a lot of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that's not the point of the
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when I go to apply my compost tea
to my garden, I'm not going to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: same sprayer because I haven't filtered
out the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would want to also determine that
that sprayer doesn't damage the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or break up the fungal hyphae during
the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for things that are just food sources
or nutrients, uh, I think it'll work
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would, uh, I would love to talk to
you about more offline about that because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, I have chlorinated water here at
our farm also, which surprises people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like I said, we're three
feet above sea level here and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have well water where I'm at in the
Skagit Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I always wonder about that
when I was making compost teas and so on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obviously not going to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I brew beer here at the farm,
I run everything through a Brita,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or run everything through a
water filter, but I'm obviously not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that for irrigating crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I often wonder about how to
handle that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put up a, um, photo on our
Instagram, also on our Facebook page for
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss Organics of, uh, compost tea that had
been, uh, made or, or added to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, chlorinated water versus dechlorinated
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they're in Petri dishes
and it's a dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be interviewing, uh,
a golf course superintendent that I met,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh boy, almost a decade ago that,
uh, has gotten into, uh, using organics
[SPEAKER_00]: and beneficial biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's reduced his fertilizer
applications on his golf courses,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause golf courses are terrible when
it comes to the amount of pesticides and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, inorganic fertilizers that they
have to use to keep the grass looking the
[SPEAKER_00]: way golfers want it to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I can definitely talk offline
about, uh, about that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of compost tea, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I'll definitely check that out.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we covered all the questions
I had on, on fish for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this will help listeners,
uh, know a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences primarily between emulsion and
hydrolysate and how to use the product
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and all of its benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, I think, I think we covered
a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate it, dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people want to get ahold of Casey
or have other questions and are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in trying out some of the DRAM fish
products, I will put all that information
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the podcast page as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you can get ahold of him or you
can contact me and I can get you his
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you get back out to your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Casey Schoenberger, the director
of sales for DRAM corporations,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer and farm segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find many of their smaller sizes
online or in local garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in the five
gallon size or larger you can reach Casey
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to place an order at 360-333-4044
or via his email, which I will have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to mention the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_00]: blog at www.kisorganics.com as well as
links to the data and information we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed in this episode on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
