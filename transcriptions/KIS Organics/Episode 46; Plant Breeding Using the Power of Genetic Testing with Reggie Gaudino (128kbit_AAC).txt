[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank those of you that have
contributed to the Patreon for the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out the link on the podcast
page if you're interested or go directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to www.patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gaudino received his B.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Molecular Biology and a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: in Molecular Genetics from the State
University of New York at Buffalo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he conducted four years of
post-doctoral research at Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: University in St. Louis, studying
transcriptional regulation of rRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie was one of the first
African-American molecular biologists to
[SPEAKER_00]: enter a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the United States in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed my conversation with
Reggie, and we ran out of time to discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep Hill and some of his current work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on following up with him for a
second part of this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Reggie, thanks for taking the time to
come on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate being able to come on and
talk to your clients or rather your
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know we've already started
chatting prior to starting the show here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to really dive in talking a
little bit about your background and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you came into sort of this role in the
cannabis industry and let listeners know
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of who you are and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I guess I'll start by officially
who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Reggie Guadino.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now the president of Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there going on almost five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in, believe it or not, as an
intellectual property consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was at the time what I was really
doing for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been for the last 22 years in the
intellectual property field going from
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation to prosecution which means that
I started kind of prosecuting biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: patents or sorry, litigating biotech
patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hired because of my scientific
background where there was early
[SPEAKER_01]: technology in the biotech industry was
centered around certain things like moving
[SPEAKER_01]: genes from one organism to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what Monsanto did big time and a
number of other early startup biotech ad
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a technology that requires that
you kind of take a gene and re-edit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that I mean different organisms use
different codons for calling for an amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that I mean certain amino acids,
let's say alanine, which makes up a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the proteins that we have in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are six different DNA triplets that
can code for an alanine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any one of them will bring that amino acid
into the protein at that spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but different organisms use the codons
with different efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you try to take a gene from
one organism and you put it in another
[SPEAKER_01]: organism, you get very low expression even
though it should theoretically work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you can get around that is by
taking the codons and optimizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: codons so that they look more like the
codons that you would have in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recipient organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my PhD work, I had done that to build
gene expression systems to study what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying to study to get my PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became a big thing in early genetic
modification or early GMO plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what Monsanto was best at at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from basically being a scientist to
being more of an intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant for biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I ended up working at a number of law
firms.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was working at law firms,
I ended up getting back into biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: because I went in-house at a company
called Sequinome, which was a big genomics
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the ones that invented
non-invasive pregnancy testing that used
[SPEAKER_01]: the blood draw from a mother to be able to
give it a digital karyotype of the fetus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really big technology because it
helped eliminate amniocentesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't know if people know,
but can have a spontaneous abortion rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of up to 1 in 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was there, I was still consulting
for portfolio consulting for IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Hill actually called me initially to
do a review of their intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: or potential intellectual property on
their chemistry side.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, they had produced the first
near-infrared potency device called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Quantican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reviewing their science to see
whether or not they had anything that was
[SPEAKER_01]: still patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was doing that, I found that they
had this treasure trove of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had so much chemical data because
they had been around since 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was floored because when I asked the
question, what do you have to do with all
[SPEAKER_01]: this data?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of research are you using or
what kind of patents are you filing based
[SPEAKER_01]: on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at me like I had a third eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is where your IP lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, on top of that, you could be using
this to trend cannabis to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually offered me a job to do that
instead of being intellectual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got at Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't hurt at the time that the
company that I was with at Sequinome,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, had made some really
grievous errors in handling their
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that my job was probably going to be
diminished there in the near future
[SPEAKER_01]: because of those bad decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an opportunity for me to leave and
to go into something really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was given the opportunity to come in and
be the director of intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: for them, but also the director of R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of the dream job if you're a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no more powerful or better
position than to be the director of
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property and the director of
R&D when you're a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jumped at the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a really beneficial pairing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were already some very good
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Steve Hill that were willing to
come and do part-time work with me because
[SPEAKER_01]: they wouldn't give me them completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to do double duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were punished actually for being
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had their full-time job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on weekends or evenings, they got to
come in and do extra work for me on the R
[SPEAKER_01]: &D side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came up with the GenKit, which was the
first really successful sex test for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to do some really good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what brings me here is
trying to share some of that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our data that we publish.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, first of all, all of our data is
actually academically oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very deep desire to share what
we have learned and what we learn with the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we have to pay for R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We build marker tests and stuff like that
that people can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, all of our data is published
in academic journals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on top of that, once we release data
academically, we put it all for anybody to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to on OCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all about sharing our data with the
industry and making everybody better
[SPEAKER_01]: because of it and helping people
understand the power of that science and
[SPEAKER_01]: what it can do for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to ask you was these genetic
markers that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what you're saying is
utilizing these markers, a grower with the
[SPEAKER_00]: help of a lab like yourself is able to go
back in then and identify specific traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a marker associated with a
trait relating to, let's say, resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to mold or mildew or yield or plant
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct in describing what you're
saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take it a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you can observe in the
cannabis plant has or is tied to one or
[SPEAKER_01]: more genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every observable trait, which we call a
phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: has the potential to be controlled through
a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant height.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the classical definition of
sativas and dindigas, there's the height
[SPEAKER_01]: difference right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are genes that are responsible for
internode lanes, phen, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowering time, trichome development,
how many trichomes you get per square
[SPEAKER_01]: centimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things have some genetic
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all the time do you have allelic
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I mean by allelic variation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Allelic variation is the difference
between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at a strain that typically
only makes 14 to 18% THC versus other new
[SPEAKER_01]: restraints that now make typically always
25 to 28%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's allelic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a difference in the same gene that
has a measurable, quantifiable difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find that number or that
observation or that color difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are all markers that you can use to
breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you tie that back to the genes and
the DNA is through something called
[SPEAKER_01]: genome-wide association.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take that marker, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You take that allele, that phenotype,
and then you take the differences in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum of that thing that you're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using bioinformatics and statistics and
some other stuff, when you get large
[SPEAKER_01]: enough populations, you can say,
ah, look, more often than not,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it looks like this, it has that DNA
sequence in this particular region.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it looks like that, it has a different
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's suddenly a genetic marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You now assign a function, which is either
the color or the amount of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, that's the function.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've assigned it to a nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as long as you can find all that
nucleotide, which you can through a number
[SPEAKER_01]: of different ways, different ways of
looking at DNA sequencing, qPCR,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you can even look at it through
a non-direct methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a function is linked to
something you can see, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily directly related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get lucky and that's
something that's called a linkage
[SPEAKER_01]: disequilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that more often than not,
instead of a random distribution,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that this thing here always
travels with that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all tools that the scientists
can use to be able to build a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program because now, when you get the DNA
from the plant, you don't have to wait for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant to exhibit that marker like when
it's flowered already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to wait four weeks to be
able to see what the inner node length is
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, oh, I know already because it
has these gene sequences that tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: already done the association that I can
follow that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the accelerated format.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just good, intelligent use of tools
using traditional breeding methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done anything to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing any genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing anything that God wouldn't
want us to do with the plant, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing it in a more efficient and more
intelligent manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beauty of what's called
marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the dirty secret that if more
people had better understanding of true
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, every cannabis farmer for
decades has been building their own
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping populations, the most powerful
tool that you can use as a breeder and not
[SPEAKER_01]: even realizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody who's been at it for a long time
has a strain that they've inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've allowed it to self.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've picked the best phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've taken that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've grown that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've allowed it to self.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they've done is traditional breeding,
breeding for a specific unique variation
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they've done crosses between
different things, that cross is the base
[SPEAKER_01]: for what we call a mapping population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take two things that you know,
you put them together, and then you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the offspring from there, the different
phenotypes, and you categorize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You then do other things with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just the same as crossing,
back-crossing, inter-crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you do something like that and
you have the control observation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have built yourself a mapping
population that now, if you have the right
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of observational data, you can
usually find a measurable marker that
[SPEAKER_01]: after a couple of generations of
interbreeding, if you can find a trait,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can usually do two or three crosses
and identify the marker pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, people have been doing all
of the groundwork for their own
[SPEAKER_01]: marker-assisted breeding populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they need now is to take what they
already have in terms of observation and
[SPEAKER_01]: familial relation, and then get some DNA
sequence behind it, and they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off to the races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the gene sequencing just
allows for a more precise scientific tool
[SPEAKER_00]: and quantitative analysis of what we're
seeing already that breeders have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing visually for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's that visual observation that
forms the basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data always forms the basis for the
utility of the gene sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene sequence, at the end of the day,
is just AGCT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you know what the gene does,
it really tells you nothing in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know I have a gene that makes THCA
synthase, but then now I have 14 varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: of that same gene, all slightly different
sequences, but they all make THCA
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase, so what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, by taking that observational data and
overlaying it onto the variation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene sequence, that's where we see the
power of genetics, where we can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, they all make the same thing,
but that one makes it 10% more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently, so ultimately, if you have
that gene in there instead, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to end up with 10% more THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an oversimplification, but that's
basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gene sequence, ultimately,
is how you follow all the things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see, and because you can follow it without
having to see it because it's coded in the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA, you can now crack a seed,
and that's the first true leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell yourself everything that you
want to know or need to know in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: your breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have the allele I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about generational propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, until we're ready, the plant
flowers, we really don't know where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going with the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one's going to be my best one when I
cross this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nurture plays a great amount in that,
and so we'll touch on that in a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's this nurtured nature,
genetics versus environment, so those two
[SPEAKER_01]: things have such a key interplay in
cannabis to a degree that is probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in many other plants, if any,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, as long as you have consistency
in your growing regime, so let's just
[SPEAKER_01]: throw that out there and then we'll deal
with that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you have consistency in your
growing regime, you can do all the hard
[SPEAKER_01]: work without ever seeing the outcome of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick the ones you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can force flower them and breed with
them with the known breeder pair because
[SPEAKER_01]: you have the DNA on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack those seed and do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never seeing a flower, but following your
traits for four or five generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then finally getting to a spot where this
is the genetic combination that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me grow these out and see what I
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're not waiting months to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're breeding in weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, you're getting four or
five generations, and so now suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: inbreeding and back-crossing looks like it
does in every other agricultural setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be you only get two
crops a year because you got to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower looks like and pick from the
flower to get the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we know what trait matches with
what DNA sequence, all of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes rapid generation cycling and then
you just look for what you want at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that is the way to maximize profits,
maximize useful space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you think of the pallet of genes,
yes, you mentioned earlier, powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: and other pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all things that we have by
looking at other agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know that there are genetic
markers for that, like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis in other plants, it actually
tracks to trichomes development.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a mutation in trichomes in
Arabidopsis that keeps it from getting
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how does that work in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be good or bad for us if
suddenly our trichomes are different,
[SPEAKER_01]: where all of the chemistry happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kind of things that we
have to look at as we tread down these
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But agriculture is built on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know what genes do what in
general, other than the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase ones, because all these genes
exist in other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look to other plants and say,
ha, in that terpene gene, if you make that
[SPEAKER_01]: change, it makes these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make that change, you make those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can go and we can look for things
like that because we have homology in the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene sequences because mother nature
doesn't reinvent herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she uses the same stuff as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at a terpene gene from
basil, it looks a lot like terpene genes
[SPEAKER_01]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, there are some differences,
but at least now we've been able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: those terpene genes from other organisms
to find all the terpene genes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this information ends up making
breeding and just even phenohunting much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier, much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we need to be, if you think
about it, because in a very short while
[SPEAKER_01]: when things are legal, big ag,
big tobacco, big alcohol, they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come knocking on the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the tools that those people
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're not using that kind of stuff,
when they get here, we will be in a much
[SPEAKER_01]: different situation and we will have loss
because we don't know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a lot of really intriguing
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list here going, but I wanted
to touch on this idea that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: here in terms of how agriculture is
already utilizing technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that sparked my mind
is I have an edible nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sell a wide variety of vegetables
and fruit trees and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I am selecting for plants for my
region here in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at apples and they'll have a
list of traits that are consistent across
[SPEAKER_00]: that apple variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that I'm getting scab resistance
when I'm getting this particular tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I'm getting, say,
a certain flavor profile when I'm choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: a honey crisp apple, but I may have a
little less resistance to mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all things that we can know
very consistently and it's very helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: data for a grower who wants to grow out
that plant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that we could eventually have
this sort of thing in cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern, I guess, my question would
be if I'm approaching this from a grower's
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, the two things that really
stood out to me is one, what am I giving
[SPEAKER_00]: up to this lab by sharing this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my wife, for example, did the 23andMe
thing, essentially finding out about her
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestry and everything by giving up her
genetic IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that was a non-starter at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not gonna pay a company to
have access to my own personal genes at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll change down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is a grower giving up when they
give you this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the OCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who don't know, that stands for
the Open Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna be talking with them here
soon as well, hopefully, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Candor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an interview coming up who's
approaching it from a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But could you just touch a little bit on
sort of what that looks like from a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower's perspective approaching this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're not a geneticist and you
are someone who's just been loving this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and passionately growing a couple
phenotypes that you're really proud of and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanna preserve, how would you use this
sort of science-based data?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've opened up not one, but several cans
of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've touched on things that relate to
intellectual property and protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe you've touched on a
bunch of these things without even
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing it because they're so tightly
tied together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the laboratory and
client relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, as the guy who's doing
this work, like it's T-Pill, this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of it has to do with
integrity and upfront transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell everybody upfront, if you come
test for me, I use your data and you allow
[SPEAKER_01]: me to use your data as I will to do
trending metrics and investigational kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing so that I can understand cannabis
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: That data is anonymized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all things that are in my
intake contract, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The data is anonymized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never tried to claim or take control of,
because again, it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where people have to
understand the patting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody doesn't invent something,
they can't file a patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody comes to me with the strain
and tells me to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I take that data and I use it in a
general, in a anonymized way to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in general and to try to trend
things in cannabis, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Varin production or, you know,
CBD versus THC ratios, those kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that data by itself does nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the larger group of data, it's very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it allows trending, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that respect, putting one data point
into 10,000 data points means absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives us no power over that piece
of that plant anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now in return for that, if I find that
something is unique, I let that client
[SPEAKER_01]: know and say, hey, here's something
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should probably do more investigation
because we found this about your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when we looked at it versus everything
else, you have something unique,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So without that ability to look at that,
we would never have been able to find
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first to report THCV,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug's Varin became a thing because we
went to Doug and said, hey, you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: know this, but this is a really special
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do something with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the power of being able to use
the client's data to be able to trend but
[SPEAKER_01]: then giving that client the information
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, we used your data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found there is something special about
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is, go to town, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has to be that ability to do
those things for anybody to get any
[SPEAKER_01]: usefulness out of science in general in
the cannabis industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody, if nobody wants us to do
that kind of work, then we can't help them
[SPEAKER_01]: do better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, there's also a whole
integrity responsibility thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who would then try to
monopolize that information and then try
[SPEAKER_01]: to do their own work to go around somebody
who brought them data, I think is,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're having a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking about science now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the integrity of an
individual and their philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, one needs to be asked the
question, what are you gonna do with my
[SPEAKER_01]: data, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a perfectly valid question
for anybody going to a lab to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that lab should be transparent in its
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I'm gonna do research with your
data to be able to help build markers so
[SPEAKER_01]: people can do marker assisted breeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also whether or not that
person that would be interested in doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: release of their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have actually asked clients said,
hey, using some of your data in
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction with everything else,
we have noticed that you guys happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: have something very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to be able to publish on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to make you co-authors with
us because this is your fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something that again,
we did all the work, we did all the
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation, we did the sequencing on
our own dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this work we've done on our
own dime so that we can build an offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna start a 23andMe for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to do that, I have to have a base of
information like there was with the human
[SPEAKER_01]: genome project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was thousands of human genomes
that had to be sequenced before 23andMe
[SPEAKER_01]: could start a 23andMe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to have a reference genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the process of building that
reference genome as are other labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to do exactly these kinds of
things which will overall end up
[SPEAKER_01]: benefiting the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this give and take and people
have to be able to buy in at their level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want your data to be included,
then you approach the lab and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I would like to work with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are NDAs, we don't share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, so anybody that Steve
Philby is with, there's NDAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't tell anybody else, we don't show
anybody else their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their data is their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to do whatever they want with
their data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put their data in an
anonymized form into our overall kettle
[SPEAKER_01]: that gives us the stuff that we do which
we then do go and patent by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now after I have all this data,
I now build tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I build methods of being able to follow
different genetic markers like using HRM
[SPEAKER_01]: or QPCR or their DNA diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the bracket one, bracket two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not patenting the DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm patenting a method to identify this
particular trait that we have gone through
[SPEAKER_01]: and with all of the other work that we've
done, been able to pull out of the ether,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, at the end of the day,
it's AGCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you put chemical data in
conjunction with DNA data and you do
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced biostatistics and bioinformatics,
you have no answer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the invention that we put into
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we share that information by making it
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, everybody who would like to breed for
that trait can breed for it using this
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we help people build their own units
and this is where it can go one step
[SPEAKER_01]: further where it then becomes something
that's very private and doesn't go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: populace, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when somebody builds their own
mapping population, because it's their
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping population and it's only related
to the crosses they've made, when we find
[SPEAKER_01]: markers for them, it is their marker
because unless somebody else has built
[SPEAKER_01]: that same exact cross, that information
won't be useful to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's what comes out that is
generally useful for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the other stuff that will
only ever be useful to the person who
[SPEAKER_01]: actually contracted for that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an effort of full transparency,
you're a full for-profit company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equipment, this science, all of these
salaries, this all costs a heck of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're looking to do is
collect as much anonymous data as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: with the goal of creating these markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, once you have,
let's just say in theory, a marker for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistance, you've
discovered this genetic marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could then use and sell and patent
that marker as a way of generating money
[SPEAKER_00]: by saying, okay, hey, I can analyze your
plant and tell you right away if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have powdery mildew resistance
because I've established this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't patent the marker because the
marker is a gene, which is a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can patent is a unique process of
identifying that gene and that allele in
[SPEAKER_01]: that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I build a very specific
fluorescent tag that identifies that
[SPEAKER_01]: allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, okay, my patent is on a method
of identifying this allele using this
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology and making this consulting or
making this outcome call, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending to use certain plants that
have that marker in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very specific thing that I can
go after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot go after the actual marker in the
gene because it's a naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That occurs in the plant, unless of course
I use gene editing and make a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I would have to show that that
change did not already exist in nature to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to claim that I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could claim that because that would
be an artificial DNA sequence at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where this conversation with
tools like CRISPR come into play then with
[SPEAKER_00]: gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you get into genetic
modification, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, and even that is a kind of gray
area, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the old days, GMO meant you
took a gene from one organism and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in another organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a non-naturally occurring gene in
an organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, genetic modification,
CRISPR, you are changing a naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring gene to a form that either
augments or fixes mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is it really genetic modification?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say at this point, it's out of regular
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're actually manipulating with DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is genetic modification,
but it's a different genetic modification
[SPEAKER_01]: than we originally thought of back in the
day when CRISPR didn't exist, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it's a completely different set
of tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is an identification set that allows
you to make intelligent breeding choices,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still use traditional breeding
methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one allows you to go in and say,
okay, I'm gonna do this differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna rewrite the
entire code so that it's only what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a single pass
stabilization, which is something called
[SPEAKER_01]: haploid or double haploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a haploid kind of mating and it works
in some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently it may or may not work in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard different reports, but it
allows you to go from a unique or a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype to a truly stabilized strain in
not what we call stabilized, but truly
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized as in it will only ever produce
one set of germplasm overnight basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in one double haploid mating,
you go to complete stability in one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which is a tremendously useful tool and
we can get it to work in cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been the traditional drawback in
the cannabis industry anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of exist in the periphery of
agriculture and cannabis, believe it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about a hybrid,
an F1 hybrid in cannabis, we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: using a very bastardized form of what is
done in real agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In real agriculture, an F1 hybrid comes
from taking a stabilized father and a
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized mother, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then making that cross from two
stabilized parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that almost never happens in
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're breeding hybrids with other
hybrids that have no characterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we really have no clue of the mess
that we've made in the cannabis industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do not really do traditional
agriculture as you would come from big ag,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we cannot do is we cannot become a
seed-based industry until we get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: point where we have the ability to say
parent A when bred with a parent B will
[SPEAKER_01]: only give you this set of outcomes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can talk about stabilized and true
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stabilized means that when you breed,
when you self-cross a truly stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, you'll get four or fewer
phenotypes back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a true breeding strain means that when
you do cross A and cross B, you will only
[SPEAKER_01]: ever get offspring C.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no possibility because they are
so stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that double haploid thing allows us to
go to that true stabilized in one fell
[SPEAKER_01]: swoop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is awesome if we can get it to work
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will allow us to now do something
that would otherwise take us a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's build a seed population now
where we can become a seed-based industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where we can now take a bag of seed
and throw it out in the field and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we get back will look almost
identical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we have to be to be able to
transcend this clone-based industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not exist as a clone-based
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not possible to scale that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with tissue culture, clone-based
industries would be hugely expensive to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where almost being prohibitively
so, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why big ag exists as a
seed-based economy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis at some point will need to
get there for scalability, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there will always be the need for
these craft breeders, the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out with new varieties and then
taking the time to breed and stabilize,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still this underlying breeding,
cultivation, innovation portion that will
[SPEAKER_01]: have to then adopt some of these
techniques to be able to produce in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that will allow us to maintain our
relevance in this industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the backdrop of this is Monsanto
and Dow and all these big ag and Altria
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these guys, they know how to do
big ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it better than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they get us there first,
they will cut us out of this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Having done research in a Monsanto
building in St. Charles, Missouri,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my postdoc, let me tell you,
it's a scary thought to see what we do and
[SPEAKER_01]: think of as agriculture and what they do
and what they think of as agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a lot of really good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things that I'm struggling
with here with this is, one, as we become
[SPEAKER_00]: more stable, you talk about a stabilized
male or a stabilized female or stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, how much genetic diversity are we
potentially risking on losing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know the medical benefits of still?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, like you said, you just discovered
THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how likely would that plan have
survived in a big ag scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of the medical community are
we potentially doing a disservice to by
[SPEAKER_00]: moving too rapidly towards, I guess,
that direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are awesome questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me answer by saying, we already are
facing some of that because we already
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what we've lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a paper was recently published that
showed that there are certain subspecies
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD lineage compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by that, I mean minor cannabinoids that
come off of the CBD synthase tree that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do not see in the THC side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is most likely because of the
intense breeding for more THC has lost
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the minor cannabinoid genes along
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've already done that because of the
way we have gone about breeding in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why we wouldn't see the
same minor cannabinoids across the board
[SPEAKER_01]: in both CBD and THC because we see some of
the same minor cannabinoids already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we see varins on both the CBD and THC
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see arsenols on both the THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that there was a mimicry or
symmetry in the two trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that has been lost because we
have not used chemistry and or science to
[SPEAKER_01]: do our breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used the seed of our pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I said this earlier in the
talk where when the only metric is did I
[SPEAKER_01]: get higher than before, there's only one
way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have no idea what has been lost
along the way already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other part of that would be,
so yeah, again, it would have to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent science-based project where
you use chemistry to identify the
[SPEAKER_01]: different classes and make sure that in
these breeding programs, these classes
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you establish libraries where you
can go back to land races and other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, and then try to keep breeding
back, going back far enough where before
[SPEAKER_01]: the loss of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you have a stable land race
or ancient stock population, consider it
[SPEAKER_01]: like the guys who still breed heirloom
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you have that part of the
community still there or a repository for
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you will never really lose it as
long as it is maintained and it is at
[SPEAKER_01]: least you do seed increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets back to traditional
agriculture as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, you have to back cross to
an original parent because you do tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose things or you do tend to lose
resistances and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always need to, you always give it
a booster shot of original DNA kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to kind of bring the vigor back up
because now you've created a hybrid again,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you created a hybrid going back to one
of the original parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're keeping it all in the family,
but getting some of that hybrid vigor back
[SPEAKER_01]: by going to an older ancestor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So agriculture has learned a lot on
itself, I think, over the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture as we know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've seen some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at white peaches in
southern United States, so that industry
[SPEAKER_01]: almost died for exactly that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything became so interbred and they
lost the original stock that white peaches
[SPEAKER_01]: are, I think there are more white peaches
grown outside of the United States than
[SPEAKER_01]: there are in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the United States was, I believe is
where white peaches originated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hopefully have learned from those
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making an assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as long as we maintain
ancestors and our natural populations,
[SPEAKER_01]: we won't have to worry about the loss of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, it also becomes important for us
to begin to educate and to force people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the government to allow more medical
research without understanding what the
[SPEAKER_01]: targets are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no reason to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no reason to do advanced medical
research and analysis if we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: told that, oh, well, Big Pharma has taken
it away, or it'll never be a medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: because, well, then we might as well just
keep it recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we should focus on things like
terpene and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we already know that there's medicinal
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, we have to have science catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot be the steep hill or the phylos
or the medicinal genomic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire industry has been supported by
bootstrapping it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I have to patent and build
tests and charge money for it is because I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get federal grants to do the basic
research that was done in the human genome
[SPEAKER_01]: project or with Brassica oleracea,
which is, you know, and other oil
[SPEAKER_01]: rapeseeds and broccoli and cauliflower and
all those kind of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've done genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know all of the important chemicals
that come out of different plants except
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without that impetus for federally
funded research, right, we will always be
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the eight ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be really difficult for
us to understand this plant in its
[SPEAKER_01]: entirety rapidly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at this point, that's what we
all need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We as an industry need to come together
and kind of find a way to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the final nail in the prohibition
coffin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make this, let's blow the lid off of it
and get money into it because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are so many avenues,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is not a single part of the,
of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when I say cannabis, I mean hemp
and or, you know, recreational varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots have their own set of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find terpenes and other cannabinoids
that are only expressed in the roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, you know, and if you go back in
the history of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, you know, there are shamanic
or, you know, medicine man kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: where they do make poultices of the roots
of cannabis or a combination of the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: and the roots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they understood then that there
were medicines that came out of different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and this gets into the genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is the genetics so important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we can now start to breed
very specific cannabis plants for very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific maladies if we have the
corresponding medical research,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of stuff that's going on with
cancer cell line work in Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then after taking flower
and or whatever else and extracting,
[SPEAKER_01]: now we have fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if we don't have fiber,
we have pulp to keep, to make hempcrete
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or some of the best, best paper in the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is so much, there is so much that
can be done with this plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to not be able to exploit every avenue
of this plant, including high tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, you know, there was a big
push on graphene as a superconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphene died when they found out the best
graphene came from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like four or five years ago, a paper came
out that said the graphene from hemp is
[SPEAKER_01]: unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now, you know, it's funny,
you don't hear about graphene anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of work to be done,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chemistry and the genetics is just
part of it because, you know, in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: exploit it, in order to get optimization
for growing, and this is where I had said
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to throw something out there
before and get back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now if you take the same genetics and
you grow it 10 different ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a bunch of different
answers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's enough plasticity in the genome
of the plant that you already see,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You already see that you have to have
nurture being very well controlled to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the semblance of a consistent product on
the outbound flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, in two different rooms,
change temperature, change humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to end up with different
terpenes even though they had the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that leads to a whole other level
of stuff, which is more science-based
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation to optimize, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can get consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can start to look like a real medical
industry if we do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you would touch on that
because I just did an interview with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Plumb recently, and that was
something that he mentioned and is a goal
[SPEAKER_00]: of him and his company over at Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially when you're getting a
genetic marker, establishing a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: marker, what you're looking at is a range
because, like you said, the chemo type
[SPEAKER_00]: expression can vary across these different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just looking for a marker that
is most likely to create a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about potentials, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, we might have an
allele that says, oh, this is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make, it's always going to be on the
higher end of production of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that higher end is a relative thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take plant A and plant B with
different genetics and plant B is a high
[SPEAKER_01]: producer, yeah, it will be higher than
plant A.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you grow it the wrong way,
it'll be higher than plant A, but it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: still not hit this full potential,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, genetics is about
identifying potential, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nurture is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has to be an understanding of
that interplay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can identify which alleles for each
gene gives you the best potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have to back it up with
optimization of that growing potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing direction a little bit here,
you've talked about science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've talked about Monsanto, Big Ag,
where this industry is headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's an answer to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big ethical dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me personally, I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle with a lot of what's going on
right now in Big Ag already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see tools like CRISPR, and I feel
like it's an avalanche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're going to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've already seen it be used in a
human female in China illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's going to happen with
cannabis at some point down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It already did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tweed has a patent that they submitted
on a genetic knockout of THC that was made
[SPEAKER_01]: using CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent's already been filed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's already been done in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does someone with, say,
my values or my background around genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetic modification, how do we
approach an industry like this and still
[SPEAKER_00]: stay relevant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it even possible to stay relevant
with what science is doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so again, there are different levels
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all genetics ends up at CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the tools that I'm talking
about, you use them to screen your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you find the population you
want to work with, then everything else is
[SPEAKER_01]: the old way, the way that you're saying
the organic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a level of comfort and a
level of understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this gets back to the
understanding the science, talking to the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs and trusting the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, we're really
just people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're geeks in white coats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we love the plant, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're doing the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not everybody is out there to steal
somebody else's thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a better understanding of the
patent world would help as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you have documented evidence
that you created this thing and you went
[SPEAKER_01]: to somebody to ask for a genetic sequence,
as long as you have that interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can prove that they didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, so they can't patent
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they try to patent it,
you can beat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that level of understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also the level of
understanding that good science helps make
[SPEAKER_01]: better plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be taken to the,
I'm trying to use CRISPR and gene edit,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't have to be taken to the
level of, I want to put some other gene in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to make it, I want to put the
psilocybin gene in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure somebody's out there trying to do
it, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different levels of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's an important
distinction in the industry because it
[SPEAKER_01]: allows people to buy in at the level that
they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that it's possible to use
tools to become a better breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase your generation time,
to be able to improve your phenohunting,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to keep good notes and say,
ah, now I have a genetic lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know these guys do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something that I can follow that
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, it also allows you to handle
larger amounts of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we've been told a
lot is it's tough to work because the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunting gets so large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can manage 10 different crosses
if you're only dealing with a few things
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can screen for the right
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you're plugging in science on
top of traditional breeding and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even touch on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where does tissue culture fit in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is tissue culture too biotech for the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tissue culture is like the gateway
drug for genetic modification,
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have tissue culture to do
genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's an important
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the industry really needs to
understand what is available, what the
[SPEAKER_01]: things do, and how they can be used so
that they can be comfortable with what
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitably has to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we will be sitting on the side watching
Monsanto and those guys do it because they
[SPEAKER_01]: use all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, they probably will use
CRISPR too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, not all science is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand that science in
order to make the right decisions in how
[SPEAKER_00]: we move forward as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realize that there are people that
will come into this industry from Big Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: that have no problems utilizing whatever
tool is available to allow them to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money and be profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add, so you've kind of
created these levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So level one would be, hey, this is an
analytical tool that you're giving us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a microscope or a shovel or
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another way to make a decision
about your plant in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what you guys are doing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what Steve Hill, it sounds like in
terms of this data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we go to the next level,
we could talk about something like CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're not taking frog DNA or
psilocybin, he said, and putting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're making changes within the DNA
code itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I don't know
quite how I feel on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of feelings and emotions on
it, but I haven't sorted them out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I guess the last level would be
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're inserting entirely foreign DNA into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, to me, doesn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that'll ever quite feel
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realize that it's still going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm sure somebody's thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to weigh in, too, because I
feel like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a traditional flower guy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I drive vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big oil guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big edible guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a science guy, I'm traditionally
pretty much a purist as well, a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that the tools, the first
level is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, in my opinion, do not think we need
CRISPR in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can accomplish everything that
we want, including knockouts without
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will it make it faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know that CRISPR is an unproven
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are papers out there that
suggest when you use CRISPR, you make
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm completely and I'm completely,
you know, well, I don't want to say I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: completely against, but I would say that I
weigh in kind of in group two with group
[SPEAKER_01]: three as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think that we need to be taking
other genes from other organisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there will become some gene that
when added to cannabis makes cannabis like
[SPEAKER_01]: this wonder drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a case like that, maybe.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that would have to be some
hugely, you know, beneficial thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that we find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but again, you know, there's nothing
wrong with using a little advanced science
[SPEAKER_01]: to augment traditional breeding
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we had to end our interview
a bit abruptly due to other time
[SPEAKER_00]: commitments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get more information from
Reggie regarding the process of how a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower can begin testing their plants if
they were interested, as in what's
[SPEAKER_00]: required, how long it takes, how much it
costs, and learn a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on following up with a second part
to this episode in the near future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was Reggie Gaudino and you were
listening to the cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: science podcast.
