[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Heather Grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grab is a senior lecturer at Cornell
University's College of Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: Life Sciences in the School of Integrated
Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this role, she teaches multiple courses
focusing on cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and mentors students in
Cornell's Hemp Master of Professional
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies program.
[SPEAKER_00]: In collaboration with Cornell experts and
industry partners, she delivers best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for the cultivation and
processing of cannabis and industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: to professionals in the Northeast and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to this position, Heather was a USDA
NIFA postdoctoral researcher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: entomology department at Cornell and
continues to explore interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and insects with her students and
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Heather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be here, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's start off just telling
listeners a little bit about yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll dive into your program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Dr. Heather Grab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a senior lecturer in the School of
Integrative Plant Science at Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I teach courses and mentor students
in our hemp science MPS program and
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborate with my colleagues in various
different departments and our industry
[SPEAKER_02]: partners to learn more about the
cultivation and processing of hemp and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was so excited when we connected
because one, it's great to see more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more universities coming online and see
programs like this that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also just Cornell itself has such a
rich agricultural history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a prestigious school that it's
just very exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting for me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely seeing a whole new
ecosystem of education options pop up,
[SPEAKER_02]: both informal education like your podcast,
but also certification programs,
[SPEAKER_02]: associate degree programs at community
colleges, bachelor's degree majors and
[SPEAKER_02]: minors in cannabis, as well as now some
graduate level courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little bit about the
hemp science program at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you can you give a little background
into what it entails?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you're exactly right about
Cornell being very well positioned because
[SPEAKER_02]: of our land grant mission, which means
that we serve the need of a diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: community of stakeholders in terms of
translating the latest knowledge that's
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and generating new knowledge in
areas that are needed like cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our MPS program was developed to meet
the needs of this growing industry within
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a one year course intensive,
although very much hands on accredited
[SPEAKER_02]: master's degree program that covers all
aspects of the hemp and cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from genetics to site selection,
different cultivation practices,
[SPEAKER_02]: processing those raw materials that are
grown into high value products and
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on product development,
even covering areas like pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we cover a really broad array of
different topics so that students have a
[SPEAKER_02]: complete understanding of the industry
from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our ability to be able to cover all
those topics is very much supported by our
[SPEAKER_02]: team of expert faculty from many different
areas, whether it's seed science,
[SPEAKER_02]: weed science, breeding, genetics,
plant pathology, food science,
[SPEAKER_02]: the law school, the business school,
as well as extension professionals who are
[SPEAKER_02]: working directly with growers that have
their hands in the soil and hands on
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and industry partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all coming together that are actively
working to support our curriculum in each
[SPEAKER_02]: of those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks can go on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a link on the podcast page,
but you can literally type in Cornell Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Science and it'll be the first hit there
on Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a master's program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, I'm on the website
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious as to what sorts of careers or
what sorts of people are taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: program and where are they ending up in
the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our students who enter the program all
already have a bachelor's degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't necessarily need to be folks
with an extensive science background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their degree area might not be even in a
science field as long as they're fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with the sciences and have a
couple science based courses on their
[SPEAKER_02]: transcripts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do fine in our classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are most excited about supporting
students that want to enter careers in
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our Hemp Science MPS program is a
little bit different in terms of its
[SPEAKER_02]: structure as well as its goals from a
traditional research track master's
[SPEAKER_02]: degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a master's degree program,
but with a slightly different focus where
[SPEAKER_02]: a master's that has a research focus is
usually a much longer degree with very few
[SPEAKER_02]: courses, tends to be a deep dive on a much
more narrow range of topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is usually some substantial
novel research production that happens in
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of a degree, which is for
students that may want to go and continue
[SPEAKER_02]: on in science careers or on the academic
track, perhaps go on to get a PhD and to
[SPEAKER_02]: work within academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas our MPS program is again,
this one year broad introduction to all
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of the industry where students are
still completing some significant
[SPEAKER_02]: independent research work, but not the
same breadth of research that a master's
[SPEAKER_02]: research track student would complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking for real like more
applicable hands on education for people
[SPEAKER_00]: on a wide variety of topics, it sounds
like, which I think, frankly, is more
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for most cases.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you asked about the kinds of careers
that students who enroll in our program
[SPEAKER_02]: are thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because hemp as an industry and
cannabis is relatively new, students may
[SPEAKER_02]: not be exposed already to all areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one reason for having a
relatively broad curriculum in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the areas that we're covering,
again, from breeding all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: product development and pharmacology,
because they may not have had much
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, for example, in a wet lab
before doing microbial testing or doing
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the analytical chemistry that is
so important to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they get some experience with
that, they may realize that that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: career path that could work very well for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of our students, so not to say that
our students don't go into research or
[SPEAKER_02]: science careers, because we do have
students that have gone on to work in R&D
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cultivation side or on the
processing side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But many of our students do graduate our
program and then go on to career
[SPEAKER_02]: professional careers within the industry
and don't tend to stay on the science or
[SPEAKER_02]: academic track.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and one thing I want to mention early
on in this podcast is we bumped this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast up and recorded it a lot sooner
than initially intended, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: deadline to apply for this program is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's February 15th, which doesn't give you
a lot of time if you want to get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully, if someone listens to this
and is really passionate, it would give
[SPEAKER_00]: them maybe enough time to get an
application in too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of application requirements,
of course, the student will have already
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to complete their bachelor's
degree, although they don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: need to come right from that bachelor's.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have several students who have spent
time in other career fields, finance,
[SPEAKER_02]: real estate, et cetera, and then realized
later that they want to cultivate this
[SPEAKER_02]: passion for cannabis and hemp and have
come to our program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our application process is relatively
streamlined.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to submit a resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have your transcripts,
two letters of recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't require, for example,
GREs like many research track institutions
[SPEAKER_02]: would require.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is relatively streamlined,
and there is a little bit of flexibility
[SPEAKER_02]: around that application date.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I certainly encourage you to reach out
to me by email if you are really excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about the program, but don't know if you
can make that February 15th deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at the list of courses
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hemp science courses recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these the courses that someone would
take in the program, or are these other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that you would recommend in addition
to the core?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a set of courses that we
developed specifically to the purpose of
[SPEAKER_02]: this degree program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also an opportunity to
take advantage of the broad array of other
[SPEAKER_02]: classes that are offered at Cornell,
both within the ag sciences area,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also students may want to work on the
entrepreneurship track, so they may take
[SPEAKER_02]: courses in our business school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a fantastic school for hospitality
here at Cornell with courses that are
[SPEAKER_02]: available for students in our program to
enroll in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a set of recommended or a
sample curriculum that tends to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: path that most students take, but there is
a lot of opportunity for students to
[SPEAKER_02]: customize the courses that they take
relative to their specific areas of
[SPEAKER_02]: interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to walk you through a couple
of the key courses that we developed so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get a feel for what our program is
like from the fall semester when students
[SPEAKER_02]: enter the program, through the spring,
and then during the summer when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing their capstone project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I know you mentioned to me that
folks that are interested in, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a cultivation side of things,
since this is a cultivation podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could cater their education around
more of the cultivation stuff if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: less interested, say, in, oh, I don't
know, some of the processing things or the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab analytical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say one feature of our program
is that we cover cannabis sativa as the
[SPEAKER_02]: full species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that includes the cultivars that are
adapted more for grain and fiber
[SPEAKER_02]: production, as well as those that are high
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students can certainly select
curriculum within that series that focuses
[SPEAKER_02]: on some areas versus others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can select courses that are more on
the breeding track or cultivation track or
[SPEAKER_02]: processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me as an advisor, I really
encourage students to take courses that
[SPEAKER_02]: span the entirety of the industry,
particularly because folks who are
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating need to be growing with that
end product in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether that's a smokable flower or an
extract or something that's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: into a food product, and people who are
working in the processing side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry need to understand what's
happening during cultivation so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can make sure they're making good choices
about the supply chain partners that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're working with, understand the
regulations that are required of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as all the nuances of the testing
that's really important for quality
[SPEAKER_02]: control and quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do encourage students to take sort of
the full span so they have this complete
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is still a lot of opportunity to
load up on courses that are maybe a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit heavier on the cultivation track.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I had a student that came into the
program and was working with me that had a
[SPEAKER_02]: strong interest in cultivation,
I would certainly suggest that they take
[SPEAKER_02]: our broad overview course, which is
Cannabis Biology Society and Industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will give them that base foundation
across many different areas of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach a course in the fall called Hemp
Production Systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a really hands-on class where
we learn about the biology, the
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology, cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: For cannabis, we do visits, field sites,
as well as the trials that we have on our
[SPEAKER_02]: research farms and in our greenhouses here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that extensive research team
that we have here is doing a lot of great
[SPEAKER_02]: work that our students get firsthand
experience with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We walk through propagation practices like
germination and cloning, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilization, all the way up through
harvest in that class.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students who are really interested in
the cultivation side, I might recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: that in that fall semester, they also take
our courses on plant propagation and on
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our plant propagation goes a lot more
in depth into best practices for clonal
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation, as well as really important
emerging areas like tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hydroponic production covers all
of the best practices for controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring semester, students would
also have the opportunity to take some
[SPEAKER_02]: really important courses for cultivators
like integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very important topic in today's
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who is an entomologist
yourself, I'm sure you're quite aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the challenges that we're facing right
now in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm looking at this list of
classes, and it's quite extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few classes in here that I
think I would find quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then along with the classes,
you mentioned greenhouse, field rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I know you mentioned to me you
have growth chambers, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's quite a bit of range in terms
of the ability for a student to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to different methods for research,
I guess, or growing styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing that differentiates a lot of
our curriculum from other universities is
[SPEAKER_02]: this ability to get really hands on in so
many different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students are growing their own hemp in,
for example, the hydroponic production lab
[SPEAKER_02]: or in my hemp production systems course.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually designing their own
systems and taking those the whole way to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest and exploring how different
cultivation practices influence yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: influence plant phenotype, influence the
cannabinoid profile of flowers in the
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the processing class, students learn
how to use an HPLC and actually do sample
[SPEAKER_02]: prep and run samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that class, we get hands on with
decortication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the extraction of those fibers
from the stems of fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do grain cleaning and sorting so we can
learn how hemp heart products are made as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as cold pressed hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of hands on experience that
is able to leverage a lot of the research
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is kind of an out of the blue
question, but do you have anything on the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic side for folks like myself that
tend to have an emphasis on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, organic production is certainly
covered as a focus area in many of our
[SPEAKER_02]: courses, and we do have several courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned there's this opportunity
for students to customize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are courses on organic production
that students could add.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have some that are even more broad
focus, including agroecology or even soil
[SPEAKER_02]: ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, talk to me a little bit about the
industry partners that you're currently
[SPEAKER_00]: working with and how that might tie into
research projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mentioned earlier that our
ability to cover this huge array of
[SPEAKER_02]: different topics for students is not only
due to our great research faculty that are
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with our courses, but also our
industry partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have great connections with folks in
industry who come in to share their
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge with students throughout the
courses or when the conditions allow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given COVID, we also have the opportunity
to go visit them on site as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in some examples of this actually
speaking of COVID is we are online now for
[SPEAKER_02]: our first two weeks of the spring
semester, which was an unexpected change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And normally when my labs for hemp
processing are doing some pretty intensive
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis anatomy explorations and
dissections to understand the underlying
[SPEAKER_02]: structures that produce different hemp
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we already have these great
connections with folks in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to call in my friends over at
GrowDoc and they're pinch hitting for me
[SPEAKER_02]: in my online labs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a tech platform as an app
that allows growers to diagnose different
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the features that they're
working on is also the ability to use
[SPEAKER_02]: images that are captured in the app to
understand whether your plants are male or
[SPEAKER_02]: female based on their early flower
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna work with them in the
online first two weeks of lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's gonna be followed
hopefully when we're back in person again,
[SPEAKER_02]: learning some of the lab skills that are
really critical for the industry with a
[SPEAKER_02]: collaboration with medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that plant material that
students worked with in the online portion
[SPEAKER_02]: of the class will be brought back to the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll take samples of that and
run some of the medicinal genomics sex
[SPEAKER_02]: testing kits, and also learn how to apply
those kits for detecting pathogens that
[SPEAKER_02]: can be really important for growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have great collaborations with
folks who are on the analytical chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one great solution for small scale
cultivators who are interested in tracking
[SPEAKER_02]: their cannabinoid profiles and their
terpene profiles, as well as some products
[SPEAKER_02]: that are offered by a company called
Lucidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are small scale versions of PLCs
and GCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have the opportunity to work
with their equipment in class,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is all of the precision of a full
benchtop scale GC, but with a much smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think potentially even more of
interest for cultivators who are listening
[SPEAKER_02]: in on this is some of the other even more
portable and point of use testing systems
[SPEAKER_02]: that we teach students how to use in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they're so easy to use that you
certainly don't need a full course in
[SPEAKER_02]: analytical chemistry to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an option in that arena is the Light
Lab, which is offered by a company called
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Photonics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we work with Orange Photonics to teach
the technology that they offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of a point of use HPLC
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in essentially like a small
suitcase and takes only a few minutes to
[SPEAKER_02]: prep and run a sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're thinking about harvest
timing, for example, you could bring this
[SPEAKER_02]: with you into the grow room or into the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take a small sample of plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does work better when it's dried,
but you can certainly do it fresh if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a good approximation of the moisture
content of your sample and run it right
[SPEAKER_02]: there to understand what your cannabinoid
profile of your plant is right in that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, rather than waiting to send
samples off to a lab or even taking them
[SPEAKER_02]: to your own in-house lab and still taking
a few hours to run those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these collaborations that
students are learning in the courses,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can then take advantage of when
they're developing their capstone project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did have a really nice line with
the folks at Orange Photonics using their
[SPEAKER_02]: Light Lab to develop a new application for
chemotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a chemotype is identifying the dominant
cannabinoid profile of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which often you need to wait to do until
that plant has initiated the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were able to develop some new
methods and then new applications for
[SPEAKER_02]: their equipment that can test very,
very young plants, which would be a great
[SPEAKER_02]: option for folks who are phenohunting out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we were on the phone earlier,
you mentioned there were some other
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies similar to this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you touch on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I can certainly talk about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a couple technologies now
that are getting even faster and even less
[SPEAKER_02]: destructive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime you take a sample for HPLC or
LC analysis, you do need to take that
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue off the plant, grind it up,
extract it with solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some new platforms out there
that use spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're using NIR and other similar
technologies with really, truly handheld
[SPEAKER_02]: applications that can allow you to scan
plant material and right away link that to
[SPEAKER_02]: a database that will tell you what the
cannabinoid profile or terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_02]: or really I think there's very few
limitations on the kind of information
[SPEAKER_02]: that can be generated with those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if folks are thinking that they want to
explore that technology more, I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: a good example of that is from Mariposa.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a company that's offering one of
these handheld scanners that then links up
[SPEAKER_02]: with their database in order to be able to
identify the signatures that are generated
[SPEAKER_02]: from that handheld module.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you finding that they're pretty
accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they correlate well with HPLC and
some of these other more traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: methods?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when folks have compared these methods
to HPLC, they do compare very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the reason for that is because
we use a whole lot of background testing
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants that were tested with HPLC and
these other more industry standard
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory testing methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: To develop the databases that are then
used in order to make these real-time
[SPEAKER_02]: predictions of what's happening with
plants that are being scanned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a high correlation among those
readings, but of course as those models
[SPEAKER_02]: are only as good as the data that goes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one area that we're really
excited about working with companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: with students in our capstone projects to
develop some of the new datasets that are
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to answer additional questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course we are always excited about
new industry partnerships that folks may
[SPEAKER_02]: be interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please get in touch if you have a good
research idea and want to work with us and
[SPEAKER_02]: work with a student.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our students are always paired up with
a faculty mentor in their area of
[SPEAKER_02]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they just work alone with
that mentor on a particular research
[SPEAKER_02]: topic, but we really do encourage the
students to also align with an industry
[SPEAKER_02]: partner to answer a question that's
relevant not only to the student in
[SPEAKER_02]: advancing our knowledge more broadly as a
field, but also to solving some problems
[SPEAKER_02]: that are real on the ground issues for
cultivators and processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's huge because traditionally
there's been a big gap between academia
[SPEAKER_00]: and real-life farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to bridge that and have
projects that address some of the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that farmers and growers are actually
seeing in the field or in their facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hopeful that you and I talked that we
might be able to collaborate on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: things or I could connect you with some of
the facilities that I'm working with that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be interesting doing research if
some of your students down the road had a
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for the sorts of things that we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had while you were talking
about COVID and everything, and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, okay, if I'm interested in this
program, one thing we didn't address is do
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to move to New York or how are
people doing this that have families and
[SPEAKER_00]: lives and they're located in other areas
around the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still an option for them to take
this program?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess this is a double-edged sword
because the one thing that makes our
[SPEAKER_02]: program in terms of the MPS degree so
distinct and have so much value is this
[SPEAKER_02]: hands-on experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have students who are enrolled in
our program that don't live in upstate New
[SPEAKER_02]: York here in Ithaca where our main campus
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over the past two years, we've had a
lot more flexibility in terms of offering
[SPEAKER_02]: options that are in-person as well as
those that are online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we definitely encourage students to
come here to get the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with our faculty, to get their
hands wet in a bunch of different research
[SPEAKER_02]: labs, on campus, and to get that hands-on
experience that's so critical for
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstrating that there's mastery of all
of these different skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are working right now to develop
some online content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the online courses that are essentially
the equivalent versions but without the
[SPEAKER_02]: hands-on experience that we have are not
on the master's degree granting track,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they are certificate programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a great example of that is one of the
courses that we offer in the spring
[SPEAKER_02]: semester is led by Dr. Larry Smart on hemp
breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has been the first one to launch
his course online through eCornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So students can go to eCornell if they
can't physically come here to campus and
[SPEAKER_02]: take the same content that he offers in
his in-person version but just online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Online without the hands-on activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone done sort of a hybrid model
where they come down for a quarter or a
[SPEAKER_00]: semester sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a possibility with your program,
or is it pretty much you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hands-on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys on quarters or semesters?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know which.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on a semester system.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so every semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to be there for both
semesters, or could they come down?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very much encouraged, but I think
we are really sensitive to the different
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints on individuals that may want
to participate in the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's potentially possible that there is
some flexibility and we have a student
[SPEAKER_02]: that's participating in the program from
New York City right now, which is not a
[SPEAKER_02]: short drive from Ithaca by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but you know, they come to Ithaca for
all of the big hands-on components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is that is overall pretty
critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we do have students who leave
Ithaca that are in our program to complete
[SPEAKER_02]: their Afton projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year I had a student that was able
to go to Italy and explore different fiber
[SPEAKER_02]: production models traveling all across
Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a company called South Techno.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year I'll have a student that's
going down to North Carolina and Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: to again work with another fiber company,
helping them with field trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's opportunity for folks to not be
in Ithaca, but at least for the coursework
[SPEAKER_02]: part of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much encouraged that you're here
and able to get the most out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hands-on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiences that we're offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd ask that question in
case there were people who were curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about these capstone projects,
because you had listed some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting research that your students
have already done and some other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are maybe coming down the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some examples of cool research
that has come out of your program over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_02]: So students are really encouraged to
develop a capstone project that is in
[SPEAKER_02]: alignment with their career goals and also
takes advantage of the expertise and all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the resources that we have on campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned our research farms that we
have here, as well as our greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_02]: growth chambers, and also to leverage our
collaborations with industry partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a great example of this is a
student who also finished last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: who I think you may talk to in future,
so I won't give away too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Andrei Galich, who took this
observation from his interactions with a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower in Vermont about frost stress and
cold tolerance of hemp and developed that
[SPEAKER_02]: into a really interesting line of inquiry
exploring how frost influences the
[SPEAKER_02]: development of hemp plants, both fiber
plants, as well as high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, and how that influences the
cannabinoid profiles of those plants as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have students that are interested
much more in working with growers from a
[SPEAKER_02]: consultation or extension focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had students who have paired up
with extension professionals within the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell Cooperative Extension Network to
build surveys that help us to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: what grower needs are so that we can
target our research, but also so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can get some experience understanding how
to assess growers' needs within the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and how to communicate science
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so speaking of that, we have a student
right now who is working with one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: extension professionals to develop a best
practices guide for hemp cultivation in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for his capstone project,
he decided to take a bite size chunk out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that production guide, although it's
quite a big bite, and focus on the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to synthesize all of the
science that is being generated every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more and more peer-reviewed
publications that are coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as trials that are published based
on different university programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to synthesize that and also
go out and do some interviews with growers
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what practices they're using on the
ground and understand what questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: major limitations they might have so that
we can continue to develop that guide in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually connected on LinkedIn
with Connor Steven, who just graduated
[SPEAKER_00]: your program, as another person to
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wonderful to see these people
moving into the industry and having
[SPEAKER_00]: positive roles and impact pretty much
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond the growth, or sorry,
not the growth chamber, but the capstone
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, were there any more you wanted
to mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you want to dive into a little bit
of your own research and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think this is a great time to make
that transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel very blessed every day that
this is my job, because I love teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really my favorite thing about my job
is mentoring students in areas of research
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my background, you mentioned
earlier, is in entomology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that got me excited
about working with hemp and then
[SPEAKER_02]: transitioning to working much more with
high cannabinoid cultivars, normally I
[SPEAKER_02]: think of as cannabis, is understanding the
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, especially cannabis that's grown
indoors, gets a bad rap in terms of its
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also a ton of ventral benefits
to cannabis production when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber and grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of researchers that are
working on understanding the ability of
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp cultivation to sequester
carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the areas that I've done a
little bit of work in is in how hemp can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually provide a resource for insect
populations that we might be concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: about from a conservation perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this was a project that was
really student motivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the students I was working with
at the time was an undergrad, Nate
[SPEAKER_02]: Flicker, wanted to work on hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd been doing a bunch of small farm
survey work around the region and
[SPEAKER_02]: convinced me that this was something that
we should go out and look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Nate and I developed a project to
survey the insect community of fiber hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: and grain hemp growing within the region,
mostly because we had heard a lot from our
[SPEAKER_02]: grower collaborators that they were seeing
a ton of bees out there on their fiber and
[SPEAKER_02]: grain plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fiber and grain hemp in general does
not have big, showy flowers compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you imagine walking into an apple
orchard or an almond orchard in full bloom
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's flowers everywhere,
they're much more subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were really curious about why
these insects were there and also what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of insects were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there some that we might be concerned
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did some surveys and we ended up
narrowing our focus down to looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bees that were visiting these plots and
found a surprisingly diverse community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including many native wild pollinators
that we are potentially concerned about in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of their populations and the impact
of agriculture and climate change and
[SPEAKER_02]: other factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course there were honey bees there,
but honey bees are not native in North
[SPEAKER_02]: America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was also a really common visitor,
which is called the common eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: bumblebee, one of our larger bee species
we have, as well as carpenter bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are bees that were visiting all
the way down to tiny itty bitty little
[SPEAKER_02]: sweat bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they span the full gamut of different
sizes, different colors of bees that are
[SPEAKER_02]: all using the industrial hemp as a
resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're actually doing is they
are collecting pollen from the male plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in these industrial hemp plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were growing high cannabinoid hemp
and you happen to have a male,
[SPEAKER_02]: though we all hope that that's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would very likely also see these wild
bees showing up and collecting some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that pollen from your male pollen
producing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now you speculate a little bit about
why there were so many bees showing up on
[SPEAKER_00]: these male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to touch on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone who has encountered a male hemp
plant before knows that they produce
[SPEAKER_02]: astounding amounts of pollen from an
individual plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one aspect is just this volume of
pollen that's being produced during the
[SPEAKER_02]: midsummer period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, the midsummer,
when it's dry, is actually a time when
[SPEAKER_02]: there are very few other flowers that are
blooming abundantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though industrial hemp only offers
pollen from these male plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: neither the male or the female plants
offer any nectar resources for bees,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are relatively few other
floral resources out there for them during
[SPEAKER_02]: this midsummer gap period, they're able to
pretty quickly learn to go visit these
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp plants as a source of pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hemp plants do contain
cannabinoids in their pollen, although it
[SPEAKER_02]: is at relatively low levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a lot of interest from
beekeepers who were worried that their
[SPEAKER_02]: bees, or in some cases, were maybe excited
about the potential for their bees to be
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing back all of these cannabinoids
and then incorporating those into hive
[SPEAKER_02]: products that they might be selling,
like beeswax or pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Propolis or pollen or importantly,
honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we found from looking at the
levels of cannabinoids in those hive
[SPEAKER_02]: products is that you would have to eat an
enormous amount of either the pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: directly or the honey in order to get
anything near a recommended dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you had said like in pounds or in
gallons, it was a ridiculous number,
[SPEAKER_00]: like more than any human could ever
consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of pollen, because that's where
it's the most concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, cannabinoids are lipophilic,
so they really like to go into those fatty
[SPEAKER_02]: substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to eat about 75 pounds to get
an effective dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of honey, because again,
honey is not high in lipids, so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not a lot of cannabinoids that are
extracted into the honey, you'd have to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat well over 2000 pounds of honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would almost certainly die from eating
that amount of honey before you got high
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a good thing, because if we
were finding the THC showing up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: honey, that would have created a whole
bunch of regulatory issues and nightmares
[SPEAKER_00]: for honey producers and also for people
wanting to grow cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good finding in a lot of
ways, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there were one or two other
entrepreneurial beekeepers out there who
[SPEAKER_02]: were a little disappointed by those
results, but I think overall a big sigh of
[SPEAKER_02]: relief from many in the beekeeping side of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and as someone who formerly had
honeybees, they're amazing creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that a honeybee could fly away
out two to three miles away from a hive on
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, come back and find a nectar or
pollen source or something, a resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: the hive, fly back, do a little dance in
front of the hive and that would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to tell other bees where to go to
find the same resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have been told the correct story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's exactly what honeybees do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bees are incredibly smart creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are they able to stumble upon
this brand new pollen resource in their
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and learn that it actually is
something that's worth their while to
[SPEAKER_02]: forage for, they can also go back to their
hives, communicate the location of that
[SPEAKER_02]: resources and recruit additional foragers
to those sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they're certainly very,
very intelligent little creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they're out there trying to
forage as efficiently as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: they learn very, very quickly that it's
only the male plants, only those male
[SPEAKER_02]: inflorescences that are providing that
pollen resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in all of our survey work across many,
many different fields and farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: we really never saw any bees going to
female flowers, even though these are
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that were grown in mixed male and
female stands for fiber and grain
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not making those mistakes that
may potentially result in the transmission
[SPEAKER_02]: of pollen from, let's say, you know,
your neighbor's plants who they bought
[SPEAKER_02]: some seeds online to the plants that you
might be cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is male plants in the vicinity
and you get pollination, it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly because of the wind and not
because of the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see a male plant nearby with
bees on it, you already have a big
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the bees' fault if your plant
gets pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wind or your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if it's not a great outcome for
you, at least the bees get, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of a silver lining there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that viral video of a, you know,
almost harvestable female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis plant that was covered in bees
is really not anything we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have used some sort of attractant
or it might have it didn't look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: swarm to me from the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know you and I talked about this
because you'd seen the photo, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of speculation around
it that we were going to have bees that
[SPEAKER_00]: were high, which we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should tell me what you shared on
that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that, you know, we're going to
have honey that was going to make you high
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could dispel some of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have never seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happening in all of my observations of
bees on hemp over the past several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you know, it's possible that it
could have happened in an organic manner,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, without maybe people applied
some sort of attractant, which there
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly are attractants that can be
applied to flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is two potential, although
somewhat unlikely, options.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that those honeybees were going and
collecting the glandular trichomes in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to build one of the hive products
that they use as an antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_02]: compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it helps to structurally fill up gaps
within the hive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called propolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll also see this in a lot of body care
products around because of those
[SPEAKER_02]: antimicrobial properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I would not expect that to happen
unless there is nothing else for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: collect to turn into that propolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems really unlikely that they would
use cannabis trichomes for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other, you know, potentially
unlikely option is that those
[SPEAKER_02]: inflorescences could have had a cannabis
aphid outbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honeybees are actually known to
collect the secretions of those aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, you know, they lay the feet
of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The honeydew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they, the honeydew, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those aphids are sucking up tons and
tons of the sugary plant juices,
[SPEAKER_02]: filtering out most, but certainly not all
of the sugars, and then excreting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honeybees will go and collect that as
a source of sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is possible that those
inflorescences in that viral image had
[SPEAKER_02]: actually just a cannabis aphid or some
other aphid infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bees were there to collect that
honeydew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all wild speculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one area that I think is kind of
interesting is, you know, I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions from the general public,
and again, as well as from beekeepers,
[SPEAKER_02]: about why the bees are going to collect
this pollen in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it so attractive outside of
just being present at this time when there
[SPEAKER_02]: is maybe not much else around?
[SPEAKER_02]: And many people ask if the bees are
getting a buzz from visiting and
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting the pollen from these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, arthropods,
as a group, do not have those
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnocannabinoid receptors that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are not getting high, at least in
the same way that we would from those
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that they aren't potentially
doing other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know, you know, cannabinoid molecules
can have antimicrobial action in and of
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, these plants are very
terpene-rich as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that one of the uses of
terpenes by plants is to mediate these
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions with insects and microbes,
which sometimes insects will take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of in order to self-medicate
their own microbial issues that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: either internally or in their colony.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of, I think, still
unexplored questions about what the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that are in that pollen are
doing internally with the bees when they
[SPEAKER_02]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're probably not getting a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying we may learn of other
reasons for that connection down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're not even aware of at this
point, just because the research hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up with it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question that this kind of brought up
for me is thinking about bees and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons we would need to be
more cautious with the sorts of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're spraying onto hemp crops so as
to protect, you know, native bee
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the sort of work that you're doing
help regulators make better decisions down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road as to what should be allowed and
disallowed on these crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fiber and grain hemp, I mentioned
before, the flowers on that crop are
[SPEAKER_02]: really not very showy at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is already labels that are on
many different pesticides that dictate
[SPEAKER_02]: when you can make applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: The label is the law there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, many of them include
language about not spraying onto crops
[SPEAKER_02]: that have flowers or if your crop is in
flower that you need to do it outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: the time period when bees are actively
foraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either in the very early morning or in
the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so creating this awareness that there
are these beneficial insects, some of
[SPEAKER_02]: which are experiencing population declines
and that we're concerned about for this
[SPEAKER_02]: very reason of pesticide exposure,
maybe interacting with this crop in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: we had not expected is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of those who are on the high
cannabinoid side, I've had a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: questions from folks who are using
feminizing compounds or compounds that
[SPEAKER_02]: cause female plants to express male
inflorescences and whether those compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: are likely to cause issues for bees that
may pick up that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of the work that's done with
those compounds that initiate male
[SPEAKER_02]: inflorescences on female plants usually
are done in greenhouse or enclosed
[SPEAKER_02]: environments, but they can be very toxic
to insects, although they're not generally
[SPEAKER_02]: registered for use outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know much about the potential
risk to pollinators, but it's certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I would be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we have labels for pesticides
that are very, very strict and why it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important you don't do anything off label.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that Suzanne has just
drilled into my head over the years as
[SPEAKER_00]: being so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope folks take that to heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we covered quite a bit
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to
mention while we were on the line here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have covered everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would certainly encourage anyone who has
questions or is excited about entering the
[SPEAKER_02]: program or working with our students to
get in touch with me through email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me, of course, if you go
through our hemp science website.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my email is heathergrab, all one word,
at Cornell.edu for those who want to just
[SPEAKER_02]: send an email my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put all the information and contact
stuff on the podcast page as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was really energized from
our phone call earlier this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to hopefully
collaborate and start working with you or
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your students and explore some of
the possibilities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for what you're doing and
seeing this research at your university is
[SPEAKER_00]: just it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm super excited about it and I
know our students will be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have a wonderful rest of your day
and we will talk soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Dr. Heather Grabb with the Hemp
Science Program at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post pertinent links on the podcast
page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the Learn tab and then
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
