[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect to find this, but it looks
like some pretty good fungal growth going
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this compost as control really didn't
produce that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we added the molasses as a food
source, we saw quite a bit of activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really didn't expect to find this
much activity just from the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is Neem cake, not Neem oil,
and it's a high-quality brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This appears to be that high-line fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that reddish tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're at 400 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fungal high-feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This appears to seem to like the Neem
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that reddish tinge to it.
It's got that reddish tinge to it.
