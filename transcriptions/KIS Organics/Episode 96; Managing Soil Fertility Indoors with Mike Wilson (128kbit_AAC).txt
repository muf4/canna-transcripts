[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it would be good to do another
podcast from the grower's perspective and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the successes and challenges
associated with running a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Michael Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is the owner and head cultivator of
Maine Craft Cannabis, a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation company licensed under Maine's
medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maine Craft Cannabis grows organically in
living soil beds and I met Mike when he
[SPEAKER_02]: reached out in 2018 regarding consulting
and dialing in the program in his
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've stayed in touch ever since,
sharing ideas and test results as we
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before joining the cannabis industry,
Mike had a career in mechanical
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering designing industrial
centrifuges and x-ray machines.

[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Michael, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you started Maine Craft Cannabis in
2018 and I've known you for I think since
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018 or 2019 but I wanted to talk to you
today a little bit about your sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology and timeline of your evolution
as a grower going to a commercial scale
[SPEAKER_02]: here with Maine Craft Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of take me through that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my wife and I started the business in
the commercial facility right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of 2018 and you know kind of
from the beginning I think we were always
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to be organic and we were sort of
in you know smaller pots at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: we were using cloth pots and you know we
ended up kind of like leaning on bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients here and there and you know if
we got the organic amendments to run right
[SPEAKER_00]: it was sort of a writing the needle sort
of operation and you know we were having
[SPEAKER_00]: some issues really getting the quality we
wanted and that's when I kind of came
[SPEAKER_00]: across your podcast and reached out to you
and that kind of began the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know you've really guided me
towards the larger soil volumes and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that which I had my resistance to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and since then we've sort of just
gone down this journey and things have
[SPEAKER_00]: really started clicking pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah can you elaborate a little bit on
that process of sort of where you where
[SPEAKER_02]: you started in the facility in terms of
even you were in these pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little about how you were
growing and then I can you know I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: can talk a little about our conversations
and where that started but I'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear from your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure yeah so we were just you know I
think we first started we were just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know mixing our own soil and you know we
weren't really getting repeatable results
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point and you know we ended up
with a lot of like week five problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically we could you know get through
veg pretty well and then by the time we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to flower a lot of times we just had
deficiencies popping up and you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw some of that in veg once in a while
but it was a lot more manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know at the time so I was testing
all sorts of you know different amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff and then with the mixing because
we're in Maine so it's really hard to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in the winter at my location because
you can't really do it indoors where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had this you know like okay I'm going
to do a bunch of soil testing I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different soils and tested them
out and you know found one that I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of standardized on that things
went pretty well and you know their
[SPEAKER_00]: internal recipe sort of changed and it
really created a lot of problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically we had way too much nitrogen is
what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think that's probably when I
started reaching out to you I was
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to your podcast which I'll
interject here I actually really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: say thank you for doing the podcast
because you know you have a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing people come on your podcast and
really flattered and like a little beside
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to be honest because I think that
most of the people that come on have
[SPEAKER_00]: really in-depth knowledge on specific
subjects and kind of my background is more
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's just you know figured out
the living soil thing in one specific
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just really you know thank you for
doing the podcast and I've connected with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people you've had on which have
been really great resources for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway so I reached out to you and you
know basically everybody I knew like just
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever would talk to me at that point
like everybody you know is having problems
[SPEAKER_00]: you just call people who might be able to
help you and that's when you know I made
[SPEAKER_00]: the decision of like okay I'm going to try
to learn how to manage my own soil and we
[SPEAKER_00]: started moving up to larger pots and you
know by the time we got to about 20 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot that's when things were I just noticed
the mending is a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's the inconsistencies sort of
go away and it's not like everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect but it was we weren't threading
the needle anymore to get a crop to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we wanted to and that's when you
know we did our first you know test bed we
[SPEAKER_00]: it was about a yard of soil that we put in
and we did a test and we did side by side
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was night and day and I was really
nervous about going to larger to these
[SPEAKER_00]: these huge beds about how to move them
around and if we're going to move around
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really just made things a lot
simpler and you know more manageable and
[SPEAKER_00]: more consistent for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well I first off thanks for the nice
words and I appreciate you coming on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to offer a growers
experience from time to time and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: your story was really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do actually think I met you when you
were still mixing your own soil because I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember you were top dressing with a lot
of different amendments and you were using
[SPEAKER_02]: guano at the time and you were like trying
to go off of what the plant was doing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you would add the amendment so you
were always playing catch-up in these
[SPEAKER_02]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah yeah in the guano I remember
that one specifically because that was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of our least reliable amendments it was
like you know you can put the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: in and that's when I started really to
just notice like okay this is a this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're buying and it's got these
numbers on the front of the but it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic product and kind of break down and
the guano was a lot of times it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot it would just you know we just overdo
it so yeah I remember that we definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about the guano I think you steered
me away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah and you just I remember you had
a lot of variables going on so between the
[SPEAKER_02]: small pots and the the various amendments
and then trying to diagnose a deficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be they can be really challenging
but and I know we I think I talked to you
[SPEAKER_02]: in the slightly larger pots I tried to
talk you into beds and you were like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just no way in this facility
you're adamant that it was impossible yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: but you when you went to the larger pots
the plants got better not perfect like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said but I think that's all some of it and
then I remember I think I actually may
[SPEAKER_02]: have mentioned this soil company to you
because I just knowing where you were and
[SPEAKER_02]: was hoping that that would be a good
solution for you and then you describe
[SPEAKER_02]: what you were seeing when you when we
talked about the nitrogen thing because I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't notice it until I saw the soil test
but you had a buddy come in there that was
[SPEAKER_02]: really good at looking at plants from the
hydro background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend yep I had a friend who'd
you know been growing for a real long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and he basically just casually mentioned
this nitrogen toxicity that I had going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like I don't know what you're
talking about and it was just like really
[SPEAKER_00]: dark curled leaves especially on you know
ones that don't get as much light and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that sort of brought up the the idea
of that and then you know we got some soil
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis back and the nitrates were just
like through the roof and that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I hadn't realized it but I might
I wasn't having as much success in bed I
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting these like kind of really
leafy bally plants that just weren't they
[SPEAKER_00]: were smart growing the same and the root
zones weren't doing what they normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think it actually was hurting me more
in veg than I realized he noticed it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room so then we just looked at
the soil analysis I remember I shot it too
[SPEAKER_00]: because I didn't know anything about
looking at a soil analysis at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you were the one who who brought that
up and then yeah so at that point I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like okay so if I buy a product it's just
like I I can't really rely on anything the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality control of another organization
and that's when I really made the decision
[SPEAKER_00]: to really learn how to you know manage my
soil and I you know I read like the Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon book the intelligent gardener
probably listen to that podcast like five
[SPEAKER_00]: or six times and that's what sort of
engaged me and really trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the idea that I was going after
with reusing the soil is one I mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the economics and the sustainability of it
but also it's if you can manage your own
[SPEAKER_00]: soil you're in control of your own destiny
you're not kind of hoping that the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've been buying all along hasn't
changed and it's an organic that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a big big thing I mean you know
organic products just aren't as consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's I think that's a really good
point I found I've heard this story a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple times not just with soil but with
bottle nutrients too with with companies
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the formulation and growing aware
of it and then having issues potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: but then there can also be mixing issues
with with batches and things like that too
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's that's absolutely a legitimate
concern right now you got into the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: testing you really dove with both feet
into that I think your engineering brain
[SPEAKER_02]: kicked in and gave you some quantifiable
numbers to allow you to really look at
[SPEAKER_02]: what was going on in your room and have
some numbers to support it and and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a really interesting aspect of
this because you got really heavy in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil testing and now you've kind of backed
away a little bit from that can you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of talk a little bit about that process
yeah for sure the the Steve Solomon book
[SPEAKER_00]: the intelligent cardiner like he goes
through when I read that book he basically
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through how to do all your own
calculations for you know if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use these amendments how to break down
with the you know numbers on the bag mean
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to you know do your amendments
to hit your target and yeah like the
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering brain definitely was like okay
like I love math like let's do this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing like a spreadsheet going and
definitely went all in on the you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: math of it all and then you know I
wouldn't say quickly but I think over time
[SPEAKER_00]: I really started to see that the soil
analysis results didn't always make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: and then through that process I kind of
talked with so I've always used Logan labs
[SPEAKER_00]: and I talked with Susan in the lab there
and kind of really was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand like okay so what happens like
after I take a soil sample and send it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you like you know because I was trying to
duplicate just you know basic things like
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and EC before I send it to them and
then see that I'm getting the same result
[SPEAKER_00]: from there and I'm getting a lot of area
just on basically you know soluble salt
[SPEAKER_00]: just it was I would get numbers that were
orders of magnitude different when I
[SPEAKER_00]: tested that same you know sample that I
took and then sent it to them and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just learned more about how they do
their testing and you know where some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the variances are and you know the sample
size was one of the things I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan telling me about and the fact that
like those soil analysis were never really
[SPEAKER_00]: meant for indoor soil as media they're
meant for field soils which are mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral soils and you know she's like I
can't even do a I have to like your
[SPEAKER_00]: material it doesn't sift through the sieve
it just clogs it up because it's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter you know like we have 25%
organic matter which is that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really exist in most field soils as far as
I know so they can't even really do the
[SPEAKER_00]: test exactly the same way and then it's
such a small sample which in again in
[SPEAKER_00]: field soils isn't gonna matter it's just
much more homogenous but with you know
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor soils you get a clump of perlite or
a clump of whoever knows what like a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a little sulfur ball or whatever
you're just gonna get more scatter in your
[SPEAKER_00]: results so then I started doing even more
testing which got quite expensive I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do multiples so I kind of have averages to
look at and then I've just kind of backed
[SPEAKER_00]: away from that quite a bit and I still do
soil testing every round on every bed but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking at more of that as a
pattern and I can know what the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: result looked like from the previous run
and when I added for amendments and then
[SPEAKER_00]: if something doesn't look right I have a
pretty good idea now so I used them as a
[SPEAKER_00]: guide now but I don't really react to any
one individual result I ever get anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still do quite a bit of the analysis
I just mix it in with intuition and in
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm seeing a lot more than I used to
because if you if you took it with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hundred percent accuracy like every
bed every round would be getting totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different amendments and that's just not
what's actually going on yeah so the
[SPEAKER_02]: sample size it does so a couple of things
I want to highlight that I've learned not
[SPEAKER_02]: just from you but from people like Bryant
at Soul Doctor Consulting and Bill
[SPEAKER_02]: McKibben over at Logan and talking to them
because you were the one that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: brought to my attention that how small I
think it was like a half a teaspoon or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that they're using on the m3
test is that right whatever I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: two milliliters or something like that I
can't remember now but it was I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: like asking her like is that yeah like
it's not two teaspoons because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: sending them like a baggie full of soil
like a family which bag yeah and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's what's going into the analysis
so if you took 10 different samples from
[SPEAKER_00]: that same bag you'd get 10 different
results and she's like a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and then in you know Bill and Susan
both were like you know really steering
[SPEAKER_00]: towards a saturated taste so now I do both
but anyway sorry to interrupt you no
[SPEAKER_02]: that's great and and this is so just to
remind people actually heard this analogy
[SPEAKER_02]: in the in a solar mineral group through
Erica Reinheimer recently a link to an
[SPEAKER_02]: article that was talking about the
differences between the maleic 3 which is
[SPEAKER_02]: the standard test and the saturated paste
so the maleic 3 is a acid extraction I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's a 2.5 pH acid that they use so
it's a really strong acid and that it will
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you everything that's in the soil
that's sort of your savings account but it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really tell you what's available
right now and they look at that like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where the saturated paste comes in
which they were calling sort of your
[SPEAKER_02]: checking account and you know for some
people that may be a useful analogy one
[SPEAKER_02]: other pointer with the saturated paste is
you can send in your own water sample with
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan 2 and that will give you a more
accurate result as to what's being
[SPEAKER_02]: released to your plant based off of your
water not the deionized water that they
[SPEAKER_02]: use as a default if you don't send in
water so a couple of pointers there I
[SPEAKER_02]: still lean fairly heavily on the standard
but most agronomists who I respect and
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I know lean more towards the
saturated paste so I think that's more my
[SPEAKER_02]: my lack of education on it but I can look
pretty quickly at a test and at least at
[SPEAKER_02]: least figure out like what the most likely
limiting factor of growth is and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: right what I think is most useful about
these tests and and I don't know that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you necessarily need to test every
bed what one thing that Brian did I have
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about offline is that when we see a
grower that tests every bed and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: also do a sample where they take all the
beds and mix them together assuming all
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants were you know the treatments
across the beds were standardized and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are all relatively doing what you
don't have like this one problem bed the
[SPEAKER_02]: results end up being within a you know a
standard deviation arranged where you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't you know you could save that money
because the tests do get very expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: like you mentioned so yeah have you found
that that sort of mirrors what you're you
[SPEAKER_00]: were seeing on your end too or yeah yeah
very much actually so yeah I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really say that I test every bed every run
anymore so in the you know in my older
[SPEAKER_00]: room the the beds are still one yard each
and I used to test every bed every round
[SPEAKER_00]: and now what I do is I do them in groups
of three so there's basically six you know
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes of soil that I'm amending because
I do you know I sort of do like 80 testing
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm gonna like you know try out a
different amendment or a different target
[SPEAKER_00]: on some things so a lot of times I have
like a cultivar that I'm running you know
[SPEAKER_00]: four beds in the same room so I'll do like
you know different I'll have like to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: control and then you know two of those
beds will be control beds and then I'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: one with like you know let's say I'm going
to try adding nitrogen at different points
[SPEAKER_00]: or something one will be like some
nitrogen here and then another one might
[SPEAKER_00]: be more so sort of use them to do tests
against each other so I do I kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: six pods in there the way I think of it in
that room and then in the newer room those
[SPEAKER_00]: beds are three yards each and then I just
take one sample from each one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: beds well we take three samples and then
do like a composite mix it up so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: only one yeah so in something like 20
yards of soil per room I'm taking like six
[SPEAKER_00]: tests which does save quite a bit of money
and I actually I look at the saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: paste as more actionable than the the
standard test nowadays sort of like what
[SPEAKER_00]: you were saying I think the calcium is the
big one on the standard that just throws
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out of whack because it's tells
you how this incredibly high amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium you don't need to amend anything
and then I'll look at the PPMs on the on
[SPEAKER_00]: the saturated paste and you know this is
one of the first times that I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: okay this saturated paste is super
important because I was seeing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's having 50 PPM of calcium when
the standard was showing insanely high
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers so now I kind of disregard the
calcium on the standard and really watch
[SPEAKER_00]: it more on the saturated paste and I could
track that with results and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin your friend Justin McGill you know
he was he was a really good person to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that as well and he shared some of
his data and I've been able to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really identify that pattern of making
sure you have enough calcium on the
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste and that's what sort of
drove me that direction and now you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: took Bryant's course to the his I don't
remember what's called but it's like that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis course on his on his website and
that really connected a ton of dots for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and he does you know talk about how to
weigh the two and which was kind of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was already doing and it really connected
a lot of it connected a lot of things for
[SPEAKER_00]: me and really made a lot of sense so you
know that was that was really helpful for
[SPEAKER_00]: me I don't use all his exact targets but I
think that the methodology of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: that was really helpful yeah and I will
say one one thing to mention is that Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Solomon's book was really designed for
people growing vegetables in actual soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and it wasn't designed around maximizing
yield it was designed around increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient density so he gets much more
involved with trace trace minerals and his
[SPEAKER_02]: targets are not optimal I would say for
cannabis and I think he would admit that
[SPEAKER_02]: too that wasn't the initial goal with his
with his writing so Bryant's targets are I
[SPEAKER_02]: think much better for cannabis but again
you're gonna want to make adjustments for
[SPEAKER_02]: your own facility just a just a plug
Bryant's class I've taken it to you it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: it is excellent if you want to learn how
to do this stuff yourself I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the best resource online and there is a
coupon code for if you put in kiss
[SPEAKER_02]: organics in on the website you'll save I
think a hundred bucks off the test or 150
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember but they're off the
course so shameless plug there I'll throw
[SPEAKER_02]: that in there you should have I'm sorry
about that yeah yeah so it's a good it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good course and it's it's interactive too
so yeah if people want to learn more they
[SPEAKER_02]: can definitely check that out so yeah just
want to mention that so in terms of the in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the testing now I think you bring
up a good point so you find that the tests
[SPEAKER_02]: give you good actual information but they
don't tell the whole story can you talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more about that yeah I mean I
mean the way you said it kind of sums it
[SPEAKER_00]: up pretty well I mean I I definitely do
all of the testing because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: with no testing I'm just kind of flying
blind because I do see that the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm not amending the same thing every
round and I do see the need like to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the amendments every round so if I didn't
do any testing I would feel like I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have really you know a pretty vague idea
how to do the next rounds amendment and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably fine but successively I
think that it would be tougher to course
[SPEAKER_00]: correct without really ever seeing what
those changes are so you know I don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the individuals I just more look at the
trajectory in the patterns that I see and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I do trust that I think at one
point I was really like okay these tests
[SPEAKER_00]: are just too erratic and I can't really
make good judgments on them and now I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of come around the other way where
you know like I have a history of the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing in in in the facility and in the
beds and I know in general where I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be and if things are you know like
sometimes I'll just get an insanely
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous number on on something and I
just disregard it completely it's just an
[SPEAKER_00]: outlier she means nothing but if I see you
know on all six or seven tests from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same room they're like okay I have plenty
of nitrogen right now I'm not gonna amend
[SPEAKER_00]: any nitrogen or you know it doesn't really
ever happen with potassium I can't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: add enough potassium but you know the that
information is still it's critical to what
[SPEAKER_00]: I do every round but I just I'm looking
more at it as a trend or a pattern of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing in the room and analyze I think
that that answer your question is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: vague but yeah I find the two levers that
we pull the most on with our soils and
[SPEAKER_02]: tests and this is a lot reflected with
Justin's test too is usually nitrates and
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium so we'll see sometimes we'll see
too much calcium over time build up but
[SPEAKER_02]: again we have to watch that availability
on the saturated paste but then nitrates
[SPEAKER_02]: the other one that for some reason will
show up and I think some of that is just
[SPEAKER_02]: in these in these large beds you have all
these worm populations that explode over
[SPEAKER_02]: time and then break down additional
organic matter and are releasing minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: and so we kind of have to keep an eye on
that because I've had runs with Justin
[SPEAKER_02]: where we don't amend at all or we just add
a little bit of egg sulfur or something
[SPEAKER_02]: very very minor maybe a little bit of
potassium sulfate but have to cut back
[SPEAKER_02]: completely just because we see nitrates
showing up yeah really high even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't add a lot of nitrogen around
before so yeah it's kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things that I one of the things
that I think I've you know started to hone
[SPEAKER_00]: in on and it solidified for me during when
I was taking the course with with Bryant
[SPEAKER_00]: was the compost because that wasn't really
something that I had an analysis on it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't something that I was really
factoring in much so when you're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: compost every round it can take a really
long time for that compost to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: release its nitrogen and you know it's
like I'm really speaking right outside my
[SPEAKER_00]: lane here but I'm gonna do it anyway so
he's talking about the carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio I think like anything like over 20
it can actually be a nitrogen sink if I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what he said correctly and I was
looking at some of the compost I was using
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was 22 23 carbon and nitrogen and
so I think in my case what might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is I was adding compost was
actually a sink for a little while and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know months later it was this
wave of nitrogen that was coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly from the compost and you know
Justin and I actually had the same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen surge at the same time when he
was cutting back his amendments for for
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate I was too and it was also during
the summer so I have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: far-fetched but I'm gonna do it anyways
this summer I'm gonna send in a
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerated sample of soil and then one
you know in the heat of summer because one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my theories is that possibly the
nitrates is changing just during the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of it being shipped and then
getting tested a week later and I don't I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what your opinion on that is
but I'm gonna test either way because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious it was both of us had this
nitrogen surge in the summer but I also
[SPEAKER_00]: did see you know high nitrogen in my
plants and I didn't amend and I didn't run
[SPEAKER_00]: out of nitrogen so there was a bunch of
nitrogen in my soil yeah so when I would
[SPEAKER_02]: we look forward to is to just for people
that are testing is not total nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not a very useful number but you
want to look at nitrates and ammonium and
[SPEAKER_02]: then right that ammonium number should be
very low like below one a lot of times it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't even register on our tests because
if that number is high what that's telling
[SPEAKER_02]: us is that there's there's still organic
matter it's still hot that's gonna break
[SPEAKER_02]: down and release into nitrates and it gets
a little tricky that tells me that you
[SPEAKER_02]: used probably unfinished compost most
likely into the bed whereas that nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: number is fairly is a fairly useful number
and determining how much nitrogen your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants gonna have available that cycle and
you can have target we have targets around
[SPEAKER_02]: that for depending on what week you're in
but I haven't thought about it in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature of that soil if the
microbiology due to the heat and travel in
[SPEAKER_02]: the in the mail could somehow affect that
that's interesting I hadn't thought of
[SPEAKER_02]: that variable there's always other
variables you don't consider and then yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Susan the Logan about it and
she was like maybe she seems kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: skeptical but she was like it's possible
like it's not going to it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay exactly the same you know so the
question is how much does it vary so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like okay once once we get some hot
weather again I'm gonna send in you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack that's a little ziplock that's nice
and refrigerated and kind of not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and then send in another one
through the regular mail yeah I will say
[SPEAKER_02]: though like like you what we found with
Justin was there still was sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen next cycle so the test yes
relatively accurate no I'm in that regard
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I pulled back on my compost
amendments quite a bit so I I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: add as much compost and I end up adding
more other nitrogen amendments and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that seems to be working well for me
right now it's a something I started doing
[SPEAKER_02]: like maybe about a year ago yeah and I
don't I don't think you necessarily have
[SPEAKER_02]: to add compost every cycle so that's
that's a that's a valid point too because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're also gonna be bringing in fungus
gnats potentially every time you bring in
[SPEAKER_02]: compost yeah yeah so that's that's one
thing about compost that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging or any soul that has a compost
fraction it's it's relatively unavoidable
[SPEAKER_02]: well let's talk a little bit I want to I
kind of want to go back to this idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: all the variables that you consider when
evaluating your plants beyond just soil
[SPEAKER_02]: testing because I know for us like when we
get a soil test from someone I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: series of questions that I need that that
I feel like I need to get information on
[SPEAKER_02]: to make an accurate recommendation I I'm
not comfortable doing it off of just a
[SPEAKER_02]: test alone because like when I started you
know it was like you was with that
[SPEAKER_02]: Solomon's book and that was where I really
started learning about mineral balancing
[SPEAKER_02]: and Albrecht and and started going down
that whole that whole path and I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: using the grow abundant calculator that
Erica Reinheimer put together it's a it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a good resource if like if you just want a
quick and easy test like I use it for my
[SPEAKER_02]: garden beds if I don't feel like doing
math you can just plug the numbers right
[SPEAKER_02]: in the subscription is very affordable and
it'll spit out something that's based off
[SPEAKER_02]: of their book the intelligent gardener she
was a she was a co-author on that but if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's for my cannabis plants and we're
talking about really maximizing fertility
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot more variable there than
just a soil test like I know I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: know what the co2 levels are they're
running in the in the facility and what
[SPEAKER_02]: the light levels are a canopy and maybe a
little about what type of genetics and how
[SPEAKER_02]: long are you vegging and flowering and
what size are your containers and how are
[SPEAKER_02]: you watering there's you know there's a
whole list of things there and see photos
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plants how did your plants finish
are you happy with where they finished and
[SPEAKER_02]: the yields and all of those things go into
the analysis it's not just you can look at
[SPEAKER_02]: a number on a test and then make a
recommendation yeah totally agree so are
[SPEAKER_02]: there any other things that you really
look at too when you're when you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to re-amend the soil you know take me
through sort of I know I I just stole your
[SPEAKER_00]: thunder by naming a whole bunch I was
gonna say you covered a lot there were
[SPEAKER_02]: there other ones that I didn't know this
off top my head it is you know one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that has really been really fun and
interesting and eye-opening coming from an
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering background into this is just
the amount of things that the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables that go into the process and you
know it's like like I want to bust out a
[SPEAKER_00]: spreadsheet that has all of those
variables and then I can do like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: data regression or something and try to
figure out how to optimize all those
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters and it's just too many so I
don't really have like a set process on
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think it's like one of those things
where you're just you're watching every
[SPEAKER_00]: run as it's going because even like light
spectrum I did in my new room I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different light types and you
know one of them is this it's a dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha from science and I really love those
lights and I had all these ideas on how I
[SPEAKER_00]: was gonna start messing with the spectrum
at different times during the growth cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and do all this testing to you know look
at the you know red and blue and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I've sort of backed off on it
because there's so many other variables
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in there that I kind of I'm not a
good point where I can like okay really
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that and consider that as a as a
an A-B test at all so I don't know I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just didn't answer your question
I think answer Chris by saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of gut feel and I don't
really have a process other than just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how that run finished and I'm kind
of always trying something a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: new every run trying to zig my zigzag my
way to optimization but it's just too many
[SPEAKER_00]: things just too many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're calling your gut is really
your subconscious giving you feedback
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of experience because you've
done you know you've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_02]: how your guts get definitely gotten
smarter I guess is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many cycles are you now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my ideas on when I see something
going on with a leaf pattern of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that means and you know I just I
really try to avoid making any solid
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions like okay I know that this
little yellowing on the serrations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is telling that I have a potassium
deficiency which is what I believe but I
[SPEAKER_00]: also am like okay that's probably what I
think that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like taking in all that information
and you know and just seeing what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of growth like if I don't see that
first few weeks that explosion like I
[SPEAKER_00]: normally do you know then I'm thinking
about what my nitrogen was probably doing
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier on in you know in the flower room
and then so I might change the way I look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the nitrogen on the next round or
something like that because that's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that for me I trust the least on the on
the analysis I almost you know I just look
[SPEAKER_00]: at and be like okay am I good here to not
amend anything right now but even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than I would like it to be I'm
still planning to add something a week or
[SPEAKER_00]: two later into flower because I know it's
gonna drop down or at least that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: mental model but yeah I don't know I mean
I think you just.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you adding then just for
listeners when when you are I mean I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of your yeah I had a lot of your your
nutrients tree in fact and then I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of specific amendments you know I had
a lot of gypsum potassium sulfate I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: few different nitrogen specific amendments
just you know like alfalfa meal sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: some feather meal fish bone meal I use a
lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calphos so I mean I don't I think I think
I probably have you know probably about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 different things that I use
regularly right now I'm doing a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of investigation on micronutrients
which we've already discussed but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a lot of that stuff on
hand in general besides maybe manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do want to talk to you about
trace minerals that was a question I was
[SPEAKER_02]: saving because okay yeah because in my
experience you know like if you go the
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligent gardener route you're adding
trace minerals pretty much every cycle to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a balance whereas my experience with
cannabis and looking at a lot of tests I
[SPEAKER_02]: now won't touch trace minerals for at
least a few cycles of testing because I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to so for me the first thing I look
at is pH how available it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: and then from there you know on the
standard all like I'll throw out some
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers like I don't really worry too much
about the organic man percentage on the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian has a really good explanation on
that the CEC on the standard is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: useful tool with potting soils and again
Brian has a good right Instagram video
[SPEAKER_02]: explaining why but when we talk about
trace minerals I find that the only time I
[SPEAKER_02]: really look at is if something looks
really really high or it's just virtually
[SPEAKER_02]: non-existent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if there's a little bit in there on
showing up on the test then I usually
[SPEAKER_02]: don't worry about it just focus on my
macros but what I know you got into
[SPEAKER_02]: fiddling there for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I definitely have what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know in that room with the pods as
I was describing I sort of did a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: three pods were a control where I didn't
do any micronutrients and then two pods
[SPEAKER_00]: were sort of you know one regime of
micronutrients and one pod was another one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then so it was basically half the room
was you know status quo no micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: additions and then the other one I think I
added then I ended up adding copper zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese added a lot of manganese boron
and maybe one I don't know I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember right now and I do think that
that side of the room has benefited from
[SPEAKER_00]: it more than the other side but I don't
see any there's no game-changers in there
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants just they seem to be a little
less water stressed I see I just feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: they can drink a little easier and you
know I don't see like any accelerated
[SPEAKER_00]: growth but you know when I first put the
plants in there's one cultivar I have
[SPEAKER_00]: which just hates me in the edge strawberry
sour Larry which is it always finishes
[SPEAKER_00]: great but I have trouble with it in veg
every round it is the first to tell me if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pissed off and that plant when I put
it into the beds that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and I've done some
micronutrient testing in veg too but more
[SPEAKER_00]: sporadically when I when I bring that
cultivar in to that room and I put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the beds that have had those
micronutrient amendments and I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: like which one it's reacting to or just
all of them combined that plant reacts
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly in the beds that have the
micronutrient so it's more like
[SPEAKER_00]: fine-tuning in general is is what I think
I'm seeing more than okay there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: magic micronutrient that has been missing
that has you know changed my world or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything where I'm more interested in
doing it is in in veg for propagation for
[SPEAKER_00]: taking mom because I do think that there's
you know propagating organically is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always been the thing I'm the worst at you
know they tend to stay in the trays a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer they don't root as
quickly I'm not using a rooting gel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth regulator and you know that
mother plant nutrition the health of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant is just that much more
critical when you're growing organically
[SPEAKER_00]: in doing propagation organically so I'm
really targeting that in in in veg for
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation purposes and just getting the
healthiest cuttings I can to root more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because I do think that
potentially with forming calluses like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some experiments on callus
formation and you know on some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: like the strawberry Sara Larry I'm not
getting a callus sometimes for 10 or 11
[SPEAKER_00]: days so no wonder I'm not getting
explosive root growth you know so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's one of my theories is that that
whatever it's missing that's really you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's upset about in veg is probably
the same thing that's really preventing it
[SPEAKER_00]: from being able to callus up and even
though I'm like when you take that cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: they look great they look healthy because
the moms in veg have bigger pots but is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know after a week and a half in a tray
you can really start to see that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing as well and you know if you check
for calluses you know they just they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not forming at the pace I'd like them to
and I guess my theory is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient is more for propagation than
for flower although I do see I feel like I
[SPEAKER_02]: see benefits in flower okay okay and how
many cycles in are you now with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your rooms I don't know I mean it's like
you know five cycles here in a room so in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room I think I'm probably with your
soil like three and a half years or
[SPEAKER_00]: something so maybe 15 to 20 rings
something like that okay okay awesome have
[SPEAKER_02]: you had ups and downs there in terms of I
mean how much does your yield fluctuate
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to cycle not much it's actually
really consistent right now so my older
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars are kind of trending down just
the vigor is decreasing the quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: still doing great but the the yield on
some of my older genetics is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: declining that's one of the other reasons
I want to look at the micronutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation is you know there's probably
been some rounds where the cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't come off of a mom that's as
healthy as I would like and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: just tends to accumulate I think so the
some of my yields have tracked down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit but then on the newer cultivars
I bring in you know they're just smashing
[SPEAKER_00]: again so I don't think it's a soil thing I
think it's just a you know having genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been propagated for four years
you know because the yields are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable I have a pretty good idea of
what I'm going to get for yield in each
[SPEAKER_02]: room and on each cultivar at this point
yeah now one thing we haven't talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: as a variable when reamending soils or
evaluating your plants is this pest
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure are you comfortable touching on
that a little bit yeah sure I mean we did
[SPEAKER_00]: that video on Instagram with the aphid
that was our pest experience really that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really traumatic I mean we've dealt
with a few pests over time but we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aphid yeah so what was your
specific question oh I guess I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about things that will influence
plant health and yields when we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about reamending if I'm reamending and I
know the you know the person is battling
[SPEAKER_02]: you know cannabis aphid or spider mites or
thrips or broad mites fruit aphids
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever whatever it may be that can have
an impact on overall yields and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: health yeah depending on how they're
managing it and so that also should be
[SPEAKER_02]: factored in when I talk about reamending
the soil if they're seeing something on
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant well it may not be from so it
may not be a soil fertility issue I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean since the cannabis aphid thing
we haven't really had any you know pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure issues I put out a lot of
beneficial these days I think of my
[SPEAKER_00]: facility as you know just loaded with
starving insects rated as eat anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that might find its way in saw some thrips
a little while ago you know Suzanne's been
[SPEAKER_00]: a really great resource for me I sent them
off to her you know we did um oh geez I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't remember the name of it we did a
release of one of the predatory things for
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips and and I've been using Cucumberas
for years now and we just we saw some
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips on a few plants for a little while
and they just sort of went away so we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had to you know deal with them but
the the fun is that issue has been you
[SPEAKER_00]: know especially in propagation with the
younger plants the fungus that issue has
[SPEAKER_00]: been you know consistent for us you know
growing organically so we use a ton of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know nematodes and there's been a couple
of times where I think the fungus that
[SPEAKER_00]: population in the in the younger plants
has kind of stunted some of them but not
[SPEAKER_00]: really from like an amendment standpoint
because I'm not amending that oil okay
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah yeah SF nematodes are great for
dealing with fungus gnats and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're just something that people
should have as a maintenance routine yep
[SPEAKER_02]: just just to stay ahead of things it's
much easier to to get ahead of it than try
[SPEAKER_00]: and battle it so yeah I learned that one
the hard way when I had that cannabis a
[SPEAKER_00]: fit after that I just loaded up on
beneficials and you know we've been lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: since then I guess well having good
practices to keep things out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility is always I think the best the
best thing you can do yep yep it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: learn it the hard way because before that
I was like oh man these officials are a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of money I'm just gonna make sure
that I don't bring in any genetics and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm just gonna keep my fingers
crossed basically no more no more of that
[SPEAKER_02]: for us well you're in a building too where
there's other grows right or in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: right there's a little more risk yep for
sure I mean you were in a building with
[SPEAKER_00]: other growers and you know I don't I don't
think that there's a high probability of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know many bugs flying around the
building and flying in my door but also
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like our grow isn't super
sophisticated we you know we have doors
[SPEAKER_00]: that come into rooms and then doors gonna
go into other rooms so in the spring it's
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely possible that we're gonna have an
aphid find its way in an open door you
[SPEAKER_00]: know either on a person coming from the
car into the building or just finding its
[SPEAKER_00]: way in because our plants smell nice or
whatever you know so as and as someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: you know started this facility and as you
know sort of evolved to where you are now
[SPEAKER_02]: what are some of the biggest challenges
that you've experienced along the way and
[SPEAKER_02]: this doesn't necessarily have to be
cultivation related in terms of an answer
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I think finding good information is
probably the biggest challenge you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like good information on cannabis is
tough to find and it's in it's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing field you know a lot of this has
been you know behind closed doors for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time so you're just calling somebody
you know or you know finding some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: online that you can go from and God knows
how accurate that is so historically it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been next to impossible to have great
information and now there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out and you know through your
podcast is one of the sources honestly for
[SPEAKER_00]: me but yeah I mean just just being able to
get really good information and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like like googling I mean I can't now
googling leaf deficiencies you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of your leaf and you're sitting
there the iPhone you know trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare this to a picture you find online
and it's you know that's it's next to
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible feeling you're trying to call
somebody you might add a similar issue so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been that's been a process is just
getting good information you know I think
[SPEAKER_00]: another one is that cannabis David I mean
that was like a that was a hard time you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I wasn't sure if we were gonna make
it through that because at that time like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you know you're kind of living crop
to crop I mean all of us growers know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like everyone thinks we're raking in the
money but you know there's a lot of money
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the business with power and
rent and trying to pay employees and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when you have a couple of crops that
aren't gonna go well I mean it's not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not long before you're not paying your
bills so that was a that was a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: scary time because if we hadn't gotten rid
of that thing you know one of my solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: was to because I was I mean I was probably
over reactive at the time I was you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really just terrified of this bug that
supposedly wasn't on the East Coast I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know anybody else out here that had
it and I remember Justin talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and he really scared the crap out of me
and then I remember I sent when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: got a picture of it I think I sent it to
you because I don't think I knew Suzanne
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time actually that's when I met
through the cannabis a foot experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Justin and Justin's reply was getting
ready to go to war man so so let's let's
[SPEAKER_02]: just touch on it I don't want to get to
insert into past advice just because I we
[SPEAKER_02]: have Suzanne who's really the expert on
that yeah and we do but I know Justin
[SPEAKER_02]: through you know some of his processes is
able to we're never allowed to say
[SPEAKER_02]: eradicate because out of respect for
Suzanne it's not a word that we can use
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're talking about pests but we can
they have not spotted another a fit in
[SPEAKER_02]: their facility in over a year or two now
it sounds like you're in a similar boat
[SPEAKER_02]: what what really like put the nail in the
coffin for them in your facility so for us
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the heat treatment we cooked the
place which was a risky move and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous move but it was we only had you
know we only had it in a few spots and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just really scared of this population
exploding really quickly and I you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really sure what to do and I
remember reading about how fast it can
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate and I found one I put in a
baggie and I went back the next day and
[SPEAKER_00]: there were six in there in a 24-hour
period and I was like holy crap so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that's when I basically panicked you
know like I Suzanne wouldn't say that this
[SPEAKER_00]: was like a smart thing to do and I try not
to tell other people like you know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you should do because I think a lot
of people probably can't do it but um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I heated the rooms you know aphids
don't like heat and I cooked the rooms up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 120 degrees for two hours and you know
I lost some plants and veg for sure and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in there watering them the whole time
and thank God we had large soil volume
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you didn't have if I was in
pots like the the root zone temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: would you'd kill the plants um you know
when we did kill some plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom but that's what I did and it
worked and we never saw another aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: again I did that and then I did a huge
release of the the wasps the colmani and
[SPEAKER_00]: hervey or something um and then you know
lace wings all over the place so we just
[SPEAKER_00]: went full bore on that and then did a huge
so we did the knockdown talk was to him
[SPEAKER_00]: that the heat treatment was to do a
knockdown um and then to you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial release after that I never saw
another aphid and that was I don't know a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple years ago now that's great yeah um
okay so I want to I want to change
[SPEAKER_02]: direction there's a couple questions that
we there's a couple things we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about that I think people might
find interesting especially if they start
[SPEAKER_02]: following you on Instagram um so two
things one I want to talk first about your
[SPEAKER_02]: blue mat experience because okay I think
that's interesting and I think we should
[SPEAKER_02]: add contrarian views to you know our
experience as as everyone knows we're big
[SPEAKER_02]: fans of blue mats we use them in quite a
few commercial facilities Justin McGill
[SPEAKER_02]: who's a good friend of mine and like
Michael knows too he uses them very
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully so you bought a bunch of blue
mats tell me about your experiences yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first bought them um you know I
bought a few to try them out and had
[SPEAKER_00]: really great results some of the best
results I've ever had is on blue mats to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fully transparent um and just as we've
tried to put them out on a larger scale
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't have a large facility you know
we have two flower rooms each one's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know one's like 400 square feet the other
one's 500 square feet of canopy um trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the consistency that I want out of
the blue mats I just haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish it um you know like my
philosophically one of the things I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: love about the blue mats is you don't
really know if you're under watering until
[SPEAKER_00]: you see an unhappy plant wilting um which
if that happens late in flower that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal um or you have you know runoff
coming out of your beds and then you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the adjustment on the um on the blue
mats and they're just really sensitive so
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time you have a bed that's running
off it's probably gonna keep dripping for
[SPEAKER_00]: another day and like we don't have really
great water mitigation I put some like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know system underneath the bed to kind of
corral the water it doesn't really work
[SPEAKER_00]: that well so in my older room where that
when the beds run off it just makes a mess
[SPEAKER_00]: um and also I don't like the idea of
losing the nutrients but the um yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you know they tend to if you get like
any air in there at all even if you fill
[SPEAKER_00]: them up and do their reading you set them
properly sometimes you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: air in one and they just don't you know
they don't work with any air in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a cushion on it so they don't
have the ability to you know the the
[SPEAKER_00]: tension doesn't work its way through to
the actual mechanism that pinches the
[SPEAKER_00]: little hose um so we just haven't been
able to get it to be as consistent on
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and some of that might just be
through having multiple people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility if you're doing a default or a
cleanup on your leaves if you bump the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing even if you don't twist the knob if
the if the blue mat itself gets bumped and
[SPEAKER_00]: it breaks contact with the soil it's gonna
think the soil's dry because it's got air
[SPEAKER_00]: um so we had a you know if you experienced
like that with runoff um and because my
[SPEAKER_00]: facility isn't that big um we just hand
water and you know I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: our forever solution I don't you know I'm
not saying everybody should hand water
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facilities because it's a it's a
pain in the butt but for right now it that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be working more consistently for
us than the blue mats were yeah so I you
[SPEAKER_02]: know uh I've heard this a couple times uh
it's a little more rare but that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it is for some people it just it doesn't
work quite the way they wanted to um I
[SPEAKER_02]: will say I've worked with some fairly
large facilities that are pulling it off
[SPEAKER_02]: um but the concerns around the air inside
the sensor or the air around coming in
[SPEAKER_02]: contact with the sensor in the in the soil
itself so like if there's a big chunk of
[SPEAKER_02]: pumice or perlite right next to that
sensor it could cause it to um just over
[SPEAKER_02]: over water like you mentioned so yeah
those are those are definitely concerns um
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I was in a larger facility I'd
probably be a little bit more incentivized
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to figure it out um because the the
labor savings would be more significant
[SPEAKER_00]: basically um and I like I think if we kept
going at it we would eventually figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out but um you know I don't know I just we
haven't had we haven't adopted it which we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it a few times and when they're
working they're great but there was two
[SPEAKER_00]: many times where it's you know the nail in
the coffin was we had um one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged from the inside basically so the
hose looked like it was wicking water and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was you know there was a we were
using the um what's that white hose stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: the uh the blue soap tape yeah the blue
soap yeah it's essentially soaker hose
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah so it looked like it was
watering um and it really wasn't and we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't notice it and it was like you know
week six and we had two beds that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: just tailed off hard and finished really
early and then we realized that they just
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't getting any water how can you
explain that because the way they look
[SPEAKER_02]: like the water is they actually perspire
through the hose itself so you can see the
[SPEAKER_02]: droplets coming out of the soaker hose
right yeah I think well so the hose was I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you know after you use them a few
times they get pretty you know dirty so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really see a droplet anymore you
more just see a film on the hose um and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in this case there was a biofilm
that had sort of formed from the inside so
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some water coming out of them in
the in the the actual thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: pressurized so it was like okay that when
you walk by you think it's watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil looks a little dry but you can
see a little wetness on the on the um on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hose itself and you can you know it
looks like it's watering um and so and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a new we hadn't seen that one
before and I think that one is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: rare I talked to a few people about it and
they were they were like yeah that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a common thing and it only
happened on you know two of the beds that
[SPEAKER_00]: run and that was the only time I ever saw
it but yeah I've never seen that but I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess I could see where that could happen
we always clean in between cycles the we
[SPEAKER_02]: clean the blue mat and and the soaker hose
to make sure that you know it's ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: go for the next cycle but the other thing
too that we typically have people doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: going around with a moisture meter and
just making sure that the beds are staying
[SPEAKER_02]: at the in the range that we want them to
because like you mentioned like Justin
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have any way of having run off in
his beds he literally has a little tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: like I mean it's not much larger than a
solo cup little bucket hanging off the
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the beds because the way his
facility was designed it was you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: an old right chicken factory so he kind of
had to modify it and there's no drains in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room so yeah and they've had a couple
floods but overall it's been it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: really really positive and worked really
well for him so yeah I don't know I just
[SPEAKER_02]: thought I just thought it'd be fun to have
a little discussion around it the only
[SPEAKER_02]: other thing I really wanted to touch on
with you is you run bare soil you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have cover crops in there explain I mean I
know I've been pretty vocal about my
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts on it but what what are your
thoughts around running a cover crop yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean most of my thoughts are probably
from taking advice from you because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know as far as like learning how to grow
in these large beds and living soil like
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been the person that I've talked to
the most so in general like I remember I
[SPEAKER_00]: was really excited about doing some cover
crops after I got the beds and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: your your advice was you know you can
harbor additional pests and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you know Suzanne's always told me
the same thing and I've always had since I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to the beds I've had great results
with doing amendments the way I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: them so I guess my thought is a little bit
you know along the lines of like if it
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't broke don't fix it sort of thing is
you know the results we're getting results
[SPEAKER_00]: that were quite satisfied with and it is
an additional thing that you would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage and you know I've done some reading
on cover crops and you know in indoors I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure that everybody's getting the the
nitrogen cycling that they that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: and I I don't really know like it's just
one of these things that I've never I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never done that and I can't remember but I
was reading something about somebody talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about doing cover crops and how much
nitrogen actually makes it back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil through those crops and I think it's
a lot less than and our people are hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: for sometimes and it is it's another it's
another environment that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage so you know something I just
haven't I just haven't gotten into really
[SPEAKER_02]: okay I thought I didn't know if you played
around with it I know gold leaf did and
[SPEAKER_02]: moved away from it I wasn't sure if that
was something you would ever know I at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point I was all jazzed up to give it a
whirl and and then I ruined it I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: were the only one I mean I talked to a few
people and you know it is one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things it's like if you if things are
going well you know doesn't always make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense to start trying new things so I
still have a curiosity about it honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah well folks want to hear maybe
some day maybe I'll try it again maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a give the thought process a
chance again now you brought it up yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not it's not a black-and-white answer
but I I definitely fall on the side of not
[SPEAKER_02]: using cover crops indoors and if people
want to read more yeah I have a blog post
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fairly recent up there on why at
least so people can read my logic and then
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me I'm wrong I get that a fair bit
but yeah I guess philosophically to it
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of made sense to me too because it is
one more variable and you know I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with some of the other night and I
was talking about you know like this
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growing process it really has so
many variables just like you were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier is that like this really is a
puzzle that I'm really still working on
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know yeah it's like adding this
thing in or not is like if I was gonna try
[SPEAKER_00]: it I want to test it like am I gonna bring
this in or not and I'm still messing with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of other things at this point so I'm
always kind of testing this and that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know maybe I'll get there someday and
it just hasn't made it to the forefront of
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've tested yeah and when you say
testing you brought up a good point you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not just you're not just doing something
across your entire facility when you say
[SPEAKER_02]: tests it's no that's not what that's not
right yep I always kind of if I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: out something new I bring it in and
depending on my level of confidence if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's from skeptical I do it on a very
small area and if I'm you know more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident I might try it on a broader area
like the micronutrients like I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: worried that I was going to ruin the soil
and half of the beds because I didn't you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I didn't even go for the targets I
went for like half of the targets and
[SPEAKER_00]: waited for analysis some kind of creeping
up on it but yeah I always sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: try something and see if it started making
sense and then kind of scale up on it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know actually Ben Higgins the one you did
with him I had my people listen to it I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like you know I was sending the link
to my employees like you guys got to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to this this is like you know this
is how I think and it's how I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys to think his process of you know
basically bringing in the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: process into the into cultivation it's
definitely like how my brain works and to
[SPEAKER_00]: have someone like really talk about it the
way he did was like really clearly so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I have the same mindset I do a lot of
you know if I if I have a hypothesis on
[SPEAKER_00]: how something might be better or you know
to get rid of a problem I come up with an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea how I'm gonna test that thing and
then prove it out awesome yeah and I like
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea that you started with half of
your what you thought might be your target
[SPEAKER_02]: just to make sure you weren't overdoing it
because you can always add more and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people I think yeah a little carried
away on that side of things so that's and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found yeah on the micronutrients
like the copper when I've added that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just stayed and that's one of
the things that's giving me someone else
[SPEAKER_00]: some competency analysis as I can see that
copper in the beds that I've added it to
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that really does make sense and
then the other ones like manganese like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added manganese and it just it
disappears so that's when I can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are actually up taking that
manganese whereas the copper sort of just
[SPEAKER_00]: stays in that beds if you add too much
copper like you're probably screwed so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of but I've seen manganese
really I don't know if it's leaching out
[SPEAKER_00]: like if we're having some runoff or if the
plants are up taking it but I suspect the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are actually up taking it because
we had in those older beds there was
[SPEAKER_02]: virtually no manganese yeah I'd be a
little cautious with it because I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was Sam Hoeffler from proof who did some
experimentation and he does tissue testing
[SPEAKER_02]: along with the soil testing and he does it
on a whole nother level no one's doing as
[SPEAKER_02]: many tests as he is and graphing them and
figuring out what each analyte is is
[SPEAKER_02]: really amazing what he's doing is really
state-of-the-art I got to he gave me a
[SPEAKER_02]: quick little tour video shot of what he
does and one of the things they found was
[SPEAKER_02]: that when they were adding manganese they
actually started to see some toxicities
[SPEAKER_02]: they got in trouble with it because it was
being taken up so dramatically by the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant so it would be keep an eye on that
yeah yeah just just watch that and be
[SPEAKER_02]: careful because you know tissue testing is
really how we figure out what's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: making it in plants the soil testing we're
just making assumptions that you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of biology that we have yeah these
nutrients are coming available whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue testing is a little more accurate
in that regard but I actually don't do a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of tissue testing but that one I did
and that's one of the reasons that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really convinced to go after the
micronutrients too because in the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: testing they were basically non-detectable
there was like three or four maybe five
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients that were just like and
then I don't know like they give you these
[SPEAKER_00]: reference ranges and it's like okay like
how much you're supposed to have in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and but there was a few that was like okay
no matter what the reference range is like
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable levels here so and
manganese was one of them oh that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting well I know we've been
chatting for a while is there any last you
[SPEAKER_02]: know advice whether on the business side
or on the cultivation side that you'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to share with folks yeah I guess I mean
that one of the yeah I mean just be ready
[SPEAKER_00]: for some failures you know even just like
about a month ago one of my employees said
[SPEAKER_00]: to me you know it's a good thing I have a
I think what he say goes a good thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a really healthy relationship with
failure you know we were redoing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the drainage system in a couple of the
beds and you know there was a clog the
[SPEAKER_00]: beds just filled up with water luckily
there weren't any plants in them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time we were doing a little bit of a flush
to get some sodium and chloride down and
[SPEAKER_00]: so we had to basically excavate these beds
and it was just like this soup and this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing we had spent a week taking out
these three yards of soil from these two
[SPEAKER_00]: different beds putting in this you know
drainage pipe and all this try to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the water in one location and
we refilled everything and then we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically take it all apart again and it
was a mess and you know stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: just happens all the time to everybody so
it's like you know I don't know it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just a lot of failure involved in
it and there's a lot of you know you think
[SPEAKER_00]: something's gonna it doesn't or you didn't
even know something was gonna bite you and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it does so it's just what a lot of
resilience and knowing that like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: just because something goes wrong it's
probably gone wrong for everybody else too
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you can you know muster the energy
to try to figure it out and call some
[SPEAKER_00]: people you can usually get through it if
you just feel like decide I'm gonna solve
[SPEAKER_00]: this I'm gonna get through this and you
know that's one thing that's been really
[SPEAKER_00]: tough about being a small business owner
it's not it's not even always cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: you know packaging shipments it's the
whole thing you know so just you know have
[SPEAKER_02]: a healthy relationship with failure yeah I
think you've done a good job of creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a community around you of
resources and then also building a good
[SPEAKER_02]: brand to where you know consumers know
what what to expect when they walk in the
[SPEAKER_02]: store and see you know main craft cannabis
and you know generating that interest on
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand side I think is equally as
important as growing a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product yeah yeah and I have to give my
wife Emily credit for all of that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were first getting going with all
that she really she's pushed me a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know share stuff on Instagram and even
to do podcasts like this like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't my comfort zone you probably
know that too but you know it's always for
[SPEAKER_00]: me it's always been I'm willing to do it
because the former me would still like to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear what the current me has to say even
though I don't know everything and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that transparency has really you know I
think it's built a lot of trust in in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry with our brand and it's really
paid off and Emily's one who's pushed me
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that because no one really wants to
make a video about their aphid problem but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the me who was newer would have
been so happy to find the video of the
[SPEAKER_00]: current me with my aphid problem saying
how I solved it even if it's not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm going to do so you know that the
work she's done on creating the brand is
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's especially the way the market is
going in Maine right now like having
[SPEAKER_00]: having people that can identify your
product is really paid off quite a bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's really through the
communication she's forced me to make and
[SPEAKER_00]: her own communication through it as well
obviously yeah I know she's gotten really
[SPEAKER_02]: into the chocolate side of things too and
using you know premium ingredients and
[SPEAKER_02]: processes to make a really high quality
product for consumers yeah yeah our goal
[SPEAKER_00]: in general is to try to whenever we do
something to do it the best we can so we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have like a really wide product line
we kind of figure the things that we make
[SPEAKER_00]: really well and that we can specialize in
and then we just sort of focus on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's definitely something Emily's
brought to the table as well I'm usually
[SPEAKER_00]: more quick to be like hey we should get
into this product this looks really fun
[SPEAKER_00]: other people are doing this and you know
she'll try to refocus me and be like we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to do everything just you know
let's pick the things that we can do well
[SPEAKER_00]: and just nail those which makes a lot of
sense awesome well thanks again for your
