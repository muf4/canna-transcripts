[SPEAKER_00]: During this holiday season, I would like
to take a minute to thank all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners and guests for making this past
year so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to your continued support of the
Cannabis Cultivation and Science podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and our advertisers, we can keep doing our
part to bridge the gap between research
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are honored that you choose to spend
time with us and we wish everyone a safe
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is my good friend,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, also known by
[SPEAKER_00]: many as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_00]: primary focus on biological controls and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne has been on the podcast multiple
times and I highly suggest folks go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to some of her other podcasts
if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast though is a two-part series
where we discuss some of the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: research in cannabis and hemp from a
recent invite-only conference she
[SPEAKER_00]: attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest topics being viruses
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Suzanne, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always exciting to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had called me recently on the phone to
tell me about a conference that you had
[SPEAKER_00]: gone to up in Canada where there was some
new information and research that had come
[SPEAKER_00]: out that you wanted to share with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just let you dive in and explain
some of the stuff that you learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it wasn't in Canada, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the researchers there was from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is probably where the confusion
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually at Colorado State out in
Fort Collins and it was a hemp research
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for the researchers in Western United
States that are working on hemp pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some hemp researchers from the
East coast there, but it's the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are focused on insects, disease,
mites, nematodes, and actually there are
[SPEAKER_02]: even some presentations on herbicide
trials for outdoor fiber production
[SPEAKER_02]: because in that situation, trying to grow
hundreds of acres of hemp without an
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide is a really big problem because
the weeds are just overtaking the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: crop and you don't get a harvestable crop
because some of these weeds I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to call them quite super weeds,
but they can overtake the hemp pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so work needs to be done on that
because currently there are no registered
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicides for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the researchers are doing the work
there and trying to figure out like what
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-emergent herbicides can be used or
more targeted herbicides that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: safe to use for fiber hemp production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a combination of multiple
disciplines, which was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing that I found super
interesting is a friend slash colleague of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine from Canada, Dr. Zamir Punja.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I have spoken together at a handful
of meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is with Simon Fraser University and
being that he's in Canada, he's got an
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage over some of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers because again, notice I said I
was at a hemp meeting because we still
[SPEAKER_02]: have that same issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the university people can't really
work on cannabis, they can only work on
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where up in Canada, Zamir can work on hemp
and has been actually doing a lot of his
[SPEAKER_02]: work in actual cannabis production
facilities, which really helps to give us
[SPEAKER_02]: a better real world perspective on what's
happening out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I found super
interesting and again, I'm not a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: pathologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never pretend to be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know I will not consult on plant
pathology, but I dangle around the edge of
[SPEAKER_02]: it because I have several friends that are
plant pathologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do see a lot of things out in the
field is that when they started looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium, which Fusarium has been a pretty
bad problem in cannabis and hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're finding multiple Fusarium
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people just think Fusarium is
Fusarium, but Fusarium is not Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time when you look up
Fusarium, you are learning, you come
[SPEAKER_02]: across Fusarium oxysporum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one that we commonly see in
ornamental crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a significant amount of
research on it, but they found,
[SPEAKER_02]: Zamir found in Canada that about,
when they find Fusarium about 65% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time it is oxysporum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are other Fusarium species
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, again, I'm not a plant
pathologist and I'm going to butcher this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can already feel my friends,
my plant pathologist friends cringing when
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pronounce this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a proliferatum and it's
P-R-O-L-I-F-E-R-A-T-U-M.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're finding that Fusarium about 25% of
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a 25% chance that that's the
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be dealing with, and there's
some other more obscure runs, but just be
[SPEAKER_02]: aware that you may need to do a little
more digging if you are dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium and you may need to get tested to
find out which one you have to find the
[SPEAKER_02]: best management practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the other things that was
interesting, and I've mentioned this
[SPEAKER_02]: before, is that we always think about
Fusarium being a root borer disease and
[SPEAKER_02]: being systemic inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a foliar or aerial Fusarium and
they've actually been recovering Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: from flower buds on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the other interesting things
that they've been observing, and this
[SPEAKER_02]: comes down to propagation, is that root
bound plants, which I see a lot of root
[SPEAKER_02]: bound cannabis plants, tend to have more
Fusarium issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: That having those spiraled roots that
girdle in on themselves are not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to make sure you have really
well developed, but also branching root
[SPEAKER_02]: systems and not spiraling to help prevent
Fusarium issues in your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was interesting when they were
talking about that, all the researchers
[SPEAKER_02]: were like, yeah, yeah, especially when
they talked about the spiraling,
[SPEAKER_02]: girdling roots in pots and how important
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: For them not to have that, because what I
often see is people hold plants too long
[SPEAKER_02]: in either a four inch or a one gallon,
and then the roots go around the edge of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pot and then they just pot them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it doesn't grow out of that
circular root ball shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, the roots get tighter and
tighter in on themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with how to
untangle your roots and kind of flange
[SPEAKER_02]: them out, make sure you do some reading on
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And better yet, don't let them get root
bound in the smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's touch on that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Instagram, I see people posting
photos of their bragging about their roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a lot of, you know, whether it's a
mycorrhizal company or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times in those photos,
like you said, the roots will be wrapping
[SPEAKER_00]: around themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, essentially you can remove the pot
and you'll still see the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container just out of made up of root
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's good root biomass,
that's not optimal for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ideal for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, so what you need to do
is transplant sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're using fabric pots or the
fertile pots, those types of pots that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps prevent this root girdling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want white, bright white roots,
not the brown or mushy looking roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically a sign of root disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to touch on those points
since you brought up root health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, people do need to transplant
sooner a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my biggest visual clue,
since this is a podcast, would be when the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are visible through the soil or the
media and have enough structure to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the the shape of the of the container that
they were coming out of, but yet are not
[SPEAKER_00]: seen visibly starting to turn and wrap
around that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's easy to check,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to be checking their plants to
see what stage of root growth they're at
[SPEAKER_00]: and transplant accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you actually the probably the where
I see this the most is in the tree
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people go by, you know, canned in
pots, trees, and then they just go pop
[SPEAKER_02]: them out of the pot and stick them in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trees, as the tree grows,
it literally chokes itself to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might not die in the first few
years, but later on in life, it will choke
[SPEAKER_02]: itself to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been in enough like forensic dead
tree talks and they'll show how they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: pop these trees up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tree just girdled itself to death
because it was the roots were girdled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or with trees also planting too deep is
one of the biggest tree killers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People plant them too deep and pile up
soil around the top of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be fatal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a famous study where they looked
at how many trees coming out of nursery
[SPEAKER_02]: production and then planted in yards or
planted too deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, roots planting them correctly,
not having girdled roots, not planting too
[SPEAKER_02]: deep is all really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I will have to say that certain
plants, especially like tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can plant deep because they throw
advantageous roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis can throw advantageous roots,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, know your plant,
no girdled roots and know how deep to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get root girdling like that,
you actually want to go through and score
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take a knife or a sharp tool and
go and go down at least four or five times
[SPEAKER_00]: around a circular pot as a way of
loosening those roots up and spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the end of the world if it
does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to plant that plant
as is, you actually need to break up the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're more aggressive than people
realize with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we will tend to because,
you know, we have seven acres here and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been planting lots of trees here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll tend to take the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like pull them out and then plant
them with the roots, then kind of out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hole to spread them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, if you do cut your roots or
root prune them before planting,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure your tool is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you know, any time you
wound, there is a chance of pathogens can
[SPEAKER_02]: get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, good old Fusarium,
you know, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zemir has not only looking at what
diseases they have, he's also been
[SPEAKER_02]: trialing some products as far as
prevention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like with the Fusarium, they found
that Rootshield did really well in their
[SPEAKER_02]: trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also did PreStop.
[SPEAKER_02]: PreStop is a newer product from Lollimond
and then also Aspirillo, which is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from Biobest.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of those products formed well as
a preventative to getting Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why for me, I've always been
really big about Trichoderma applications
[SPEAKER_02]: early on, because Trichoderma will
actually eat Fusarium and protect your
[SPEAKER_02]: roots and prevent you from getting the
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once you get Fusarium,
it's very, very difficult to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So prevention is key here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are finding in their cannabis
trials on Fusarium that, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rootshield, PreStop and Aspirillo have
been doing a very good preventative job of
[SPEAKER_02]: preventing the plants from getting the
path.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing a very good job of
protecting the plants from the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they talk about environmental
conditions or seasonality affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalence of Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because his stuff that he's doing is
controlled in indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's not as seasonal as it would be
outside in outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's summer year round inside of a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, but we still see it showing up,
obviously, in greenhouses and indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things like, even though cannabis
doesn't get it like Downy mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't get that till later season
because on the East Coast, that's got to
[SPEAKER_02]: blow up on the jet stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see seasonality of disease
because the environment's moving the
[SPEAKER_02]: disease around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, he didn't go into that too much at
all on the environment as far as patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy to me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember hearing that at a talk about
how these spores actually go up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, like quite high in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, the jet stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea that the spores could travel
as far or as high as they do or the
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's some crazy stuff where they're
actually, you know, going up there and
[SPEAKER_02]: then looking for what they can find up in,
I don't know if the right word is the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're finding pathogens up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, with hurricanes,
you know, I grew up in Florida and work a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot in the Florida industry, too,
and why we see bad disease issues after
[SPEAKER_02]: hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of thought it was because,
oh, there's so much rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they think now part of it is is just
the giant wind blender of moving all the
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens around and then dumping the
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some interesting work being
looked at with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what other research did you find was
presented at the conference that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you thought would be relevant to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the biggest focuses that
Samir has been working on is Hapsalitin
[SPEAKER_02]: virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a sensitive touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the description is,
but it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a while, I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was convinced how much of an issue it
was only because, again, I don't run in
[SPEAKER_02]: this arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I run with six and eight legged
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had done or they have been doing
up in Canada some really extensive
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2020 through 2022, they started
testing cannabis plants for different
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases, mostly virus stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, virus and Hapsalitin viroid,
which is not a virus, and looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did find through their surveying
out there, in Canada, they tested over
[SPEAKER_02]: 1700 cannabis plants in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that about 19% of those
plants tested positive for Hapsalitin
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost 20% of the plants tested
positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't know they have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since there's no way of curing or
fixing it, it's too late, it's just too
[SPEAKER_02]: late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having it is too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they start seeing the smaller plants,
the smaller flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the biggest take home things
for me was the imagery that they had of
[SPEAKER_02]: the trichomes and how the trichomes were
significantly smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have the same number of
trichomes, but you have smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: like these deflated, it's almost like a
deflated balloon of a trichome head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And leads to less THC and less CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be pretty devastating to the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that was, this was one of the
very interesting things for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, don't come back to me and ask
questions because I'm not a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: pathologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Zamir has put out some really good
papers and he's done some really good
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things they started looking
at was if they're testing plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: people are like, yay, I test my plants,
I test negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they sell off clones or move them
to other facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it spreading so much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what they started looking at is they
tested the roots, the stems, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was super interesting is that on
the test, the testing, they found that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had this really great chart,
which I talked to him about recreating
[SPEAKER_02]: this chart for an online infograph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to talk to him about getting
that done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, if they tested a leaf,
you could have a negative result.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tested a stem, you could have a
negative result.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tested that same plant and you
tested the roots, you can test positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the leaves test positive,
the roots are always positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really wanna know if you have it
or not, you have to test the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, if the roots are the one
consistently positive thing in a way,
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, you can have negative
leaves and negative roots, but you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: have positive leaves and negative roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the foliage is positive and the stems
are positive, the roots are gonna be
positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have positive roots and
negative stems and foliage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just testing the foliage is not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think possibly this is what's
happened is because we're also trained for
[SPEAKER_02]: testing the foliage for viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't ever taught to test roots for
viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when people started talking about
it more, they're like, well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain viruses move to the root systems
and they hang out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on they express themselves,
thus latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they think this is part of what's
happening is people test their plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: in good faith, they think they're
negative, but they're actually positive
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's positive in the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think this is kind of what's
created some problems, confusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think you have clean plants,
but then you end up with a viroid and how
[SPEAKER_02]: did you get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been lots of speculation on
how it is being transmitted out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a super interesting thing for
me to realize that you can't just be
[SPEAKER_02]: testing foliage, that you need to be
testing root systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be cautious because you can't test
like roots with soil because the soil can
[SPEAKER_02]: mess up test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to talk with your testing company
on the procedure and protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was at MJBizCon last week with
you, I did talk to some of the testing
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and I'm waiting for someone to
give me some answers on protocol for
[SPEAKER_02]: testing roots because the people at the
show didn't have a clear answer because
[SPEAKER_02]: again, you have to be able to remove all
the soil, but you can't add anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: could possibly mess your test up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been talking to Three Rivers
Biotech about this and I'm just going back
[SPEAKER_00]: here to my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did some research where they also
found similar results where they had 14
[SPEAKER_00]: positive root samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only seven of those were positive on leaf
samples out of 35 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they do have the ability to
test the roots because I'd asked them this
[SPEAKER_00]: after talking to you last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to confirm that because we've been
working with them to offer testing for top
[SPEAKER_00]: slate and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one of the recommendations was
you test the plant and then test it again
[SPEAKER_00]: a few weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another way of kind of getting
to that positive answer or negative or
[SPEAKER_00]: more confirmed negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zamir says three tests, three tests before
you can say a plant does not have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is you test it, you think it's
negative and it's sitting there and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get into the spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is stuff that Zamir's been
looking at where they're looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: movement like he had these maps of
greenhouses and showing which plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see, you know, hot zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question is, how is it being
spread?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been thrown out there about
root aphids vectoring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much all the research people have,
you know, said that's not likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been corresponding with Dr. Susan
Halbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's one of the top aphid experts in
probably North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the general consensus is
most likely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's enough mechanical of
people with pruners and touching plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the areas they're just starting
to look at is it could it be waterborne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to wait until more
research comes out about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I know that in the hemp side of
things here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Purdue's looking at all this stuff,
UC Riverside and up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon Fraser Universities, who's doing a
lot of this research on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not clear answers yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, again, this is so you don't
think it's pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spread by pests at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not a likely vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say waterborne, though,
are you talking about splashing from when
[SPEAKER_00]: people are mechanically watering or are
you talking about like transpiration?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like through water movement, like through
sub irrigation sharing, like ebb and flood
[SPEAKER_02]: benches, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, for me, I think the bigger
implication is for those of us that reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: the media, if that soil has had a plant
that had a, you know, a positive test for
[SPEAKER_00]: a virus, I don't know if we have ways of
remediating that at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, though I have growers with,
you know, currently doing quite well that
[SPEAKER_00]: have tested positive for the virus and are
reusing their media in those beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to really manage the plants
and keep them really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't see a lot of effect
from the virus, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they if they miss it and the plants
are not as healthy as they should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it seems like they just really crash
much harder than a non infected plant
[SPEAKER_00]: would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just like people, you know,
you're run down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not eating well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having coke for breakfast every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just I just want to be careful
with our human analogies because I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like some people take them too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I think it applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other cases, I think people start
making comparisons that don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all know anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're healthier, you're less likely to
have issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's a well-known thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think that with having healthy
plants, I mean, you can just like root
[SPEAKER_02]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen people with root aphids
and bad ones, but they have a healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: looking crop because the plants are
healthy enough to get through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things that scares me
about raising soil is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: chopping the plants off and then planting
right next to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not removing the the roots that can
have pathogens in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when people chop the foliage and put
it on the soil surface, because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: just be recycling pathogens and pests
right back into your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that we've got enough healthy
things to fight it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you hope you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do until you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from an environmental standpoint,
I understand, you know, reusing the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's, you know, much more
eco-friendly to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you have to know
your crop and you have to know your risk
[SPEAKER_02]: to know if that's right for what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also depends on on the size of your
production, because if you've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of my growers on
ornamentals, you know, there are hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: of acres and trying to micro manage all
those crops, you know, it's just it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a smaller growing system,
often like you do in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can micro manage the crops better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's different to when the plants
leaving the facility as a living plant
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently, like you see with your
ornamental side, you brought up this
[SPEAKER_00]: concept, though, of healthy plants being
more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of in my head led me to the
bricks discussion that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel like we should at least
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I still see it out there quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just explain to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mentioned this to people that
there is research out there that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that and correct me if I misstate this,
but that it doesn't really matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy your plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's insect pressure that is
sufficient, you will still the insects
[SPEAKER_00]: will still eat the plant more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sugars did not equate healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I just take us through it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is this should I say urban
legend?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the people that make these
claims say they have data, but they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: show you any data or any research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of yet, the research that has been
looked at that pretty much disproves it
[SPEAKER_02]: just because you have high bricks does not
mean you have pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see this in almost every talk I
give.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you walk out your back door and you're
in like virgin forest in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana or, you know, Wyoming,
every plant you're looking at there is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting eaten by insects because plants
are designed to be eaten by insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you look at oak trees,
caterpillars eat the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why trees have so many leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The caterpillars poop on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes the fertilizer for the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants being eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we have these monocultures,
I want perfect plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when, you know, this human,
you know, we're trying to create a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: for humans and we have zero tolerance
really for insects, even though plants can
[SPEAKER_02]: still perform well, even if there's
feeding damage on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugars really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If insects didn't like to feed on sugary
plants, why do things eat apples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do things eat grapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do things eat blueberries?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those fruits are all super high in
sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you look at Drosophila
Suzukii.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember the common name
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge pest in berries where this
Drosophila, it's a fruit fly comes in,
[SPEAKER_02]: lays its egg inside of blueberries,
raspberries, all these different berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the maggot eats the fruit and
that's high sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is high sugar stopping that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the crazy thing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know the whole idea of the
bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, I do have over in my drawer
right next to me, I have a bricks meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more testing sugars for for
understanding for grapes, for knowing the
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar content for, you know, food
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this whole idea of just pumping your
bricks and you won't have pest issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just no evidence of it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could we could we say, though,
that if you had two cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: one had a higher bricks level,
it may, in theory, be a healthier plant if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does high bricks mean healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the correlation that a lot
of growers or association that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers have been making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is supposedly it's going to be healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hit a certain bricks number on
that for that particular crop and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a different number for
blueberries, apples, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you will not see pest pressure on
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I mean, that's the argument that's
that's being presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's but from an entomologist,
you're saying that you just haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: any research to support this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's not research that supports
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen there's like one paper that was
kind of inconclusive, but pretty much the
[SPEAKER_02]: research that has been done in the past
disproves this claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the people that are currently
making these claims, they'll just say they
[SPEAKER_02]: say they have data, but they've never
publicly released it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never published a paper on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never written a scientific journal
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we've got this big secret,
but we're not going to tell you how we did
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trust us, even though we're not going
to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, so if anyone has data on this and
is listening, send it to Suzanne and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do a whole podcast on bricks if if
someone can prove it to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one one other note, though,
when we're talking about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: though, there there is, like you
mentioned, this human analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is it is the same with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a healthier plant,
it's going to be more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To pests, pests tend to go to the stressed
out plant in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's fairly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that safe to say you're kind of making
a face?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, again, you know,
I also think part of our problem is is the
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact we're dealing with so many
invasives that that kind of throws
[SPEAKER_02]: everything out the window because you look
at the United States and ash trees and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're basically all gone because
of emerald ash borer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cannot tell me these millions of
trees that have been killed were
[SPEAKER_02]: unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because we had an invasive come in
the emerald ash borer and wipe out all the
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those trees have been living healthily
for, you know, hundreds of years in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant health and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going overboard with plant health,
because there's this fine line of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, NPK and other nutrients and
plants, but, you know, giving them too
[SPEAKER_02]: much love, too much nitrogen can
definitely create pest issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been really good research out of
like Texas A&M looking specific
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically at nitrogen levels in
correlation to Western flower thrips and
[SPEAKER_02]: two spotted spider mites showing that
pushing your plant with too much nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: creates pest problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this happy medium of not
overfeeding, not underfeeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: being right in the middle that makes it
less attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or because there's a difference between
plants, pests being attracted to it or
[SPEAKER_02]: pests having a higher reproductive rate on
the plant because of its nutritional
[SPEAKER_02]: content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two completely different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at I think what probably the most
famous case of that is actually a
[SPEAKER_02]: metacloprid, which I know legal cannabis
grower is going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the neonics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been used for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's kind of at the center of the bee
controversy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things we know about that
is if you treat a plant with that and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you put two spot spider mites on it,
those spider mites, females actually live
[SPEAKER_02]: longer and have more babies because a
metacloprid without going too deep
[SPEAKER_02]: basically acts as a plant growth
stimulant, making the plant more
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritious for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that situation, you know,
you can have a healthy plant and just by
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a pesticide on it, you can create
a spider mite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super interesting because initially
the research was that they thought what
[SPEAKER_02]: was happening in the landscape was a
metacloprid was killing off the
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the spider mites were
exploding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the guys involved that Mike
Rupp at the University of Maryland,
[SPEAKER_02]: he is an amazing landscape research
entomologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and his wife are Paula Shoesbearer,
like a powerhouse of nerddom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike got involved and he helped figure
out that, no, it's not that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killing off the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually, I've seen images where
plants treated with metacloprid,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves are actually bigger than
non-treated plants in a controlled study
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, it's acting as a plant
growth stimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, I mean, there's so many things
going on that we, and we want a simple
[SPEAKER_02]: answer and we want to simplify everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't, because no matter what you
do, there's going to be a consequence to
[SPEAKER_02]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we try to do is have minimal
impact, reduce our pest risk and follow
[SPEAKER_02]: science is what we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, try to be
environmental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me lead back to the BRICS
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a simplified explanation,
but maybe there's something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing in their ways of supposedly
attaining higher sugar levels that may
[SPEAKER_00]: increase pest resistance that we,
a mechanism we have and identify with,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they should be able to see that
in the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that would, you would think it would
be reflected in the research unless those
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers are not replicating what
people are claiming in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many, so many, you can,
back to the metacloprid thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good example that everybody
thought and it makes sense that you apply
[SPEAKER_02]: a pesticide that's going to kill off the
beneficials and you have more pest issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we see that quite a bit with
especially like bifenthrin and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where everybody just assumed
that was the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was why it was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not till we really get in there,
you know, it really had nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: the beneficials in that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people jump to anecdotal
conclusions without having controls and
[SPEAKER_02]: without having replications, because if
you're in a commercial production
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, it's very hard to have a control
where, hey, we're just not going to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, treat or do this or we're going
to treat in a different way and then have
[SPEAKER_02]: replications because your goal is to
produce a product and get it out the door,
[SPEAKER_02]: not do research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think sometimes people jump to
conclusions, which I will say,
[SPEAKER_02]: though, that these anecdotal observations
that growers do see are very, very
[SPEAKER_02]: important because that plants the seed for
the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to look at that and be
like, OK, is this what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it all started,
the bricks thing years ago, because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of this bricks work is really older work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that was done the last
couple of years, probably decades ago that
[SPEAKER_02]: they did go out and look at these and,
you know, get the research from an
[SPEAKER_02]: anecdotal observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not discounting anybody's
observations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to be observant,
start thinking about, well, why is this
[SPEAKER_02]: happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we seeing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this plant doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and this is kind of what I do
with my observations through the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is I travel everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in all kinds of production facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, OK, well, we don't
understand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll go to my research friends at
the university who they can do the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled research and help work with
them to formulate the trials that need to
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually heading to Michigan next week
because I'm on an advisory committee for
[SPEAKER_02]: high tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be working with several
universities on helping steer research
[SPEAKER_02]: from observations I seen in the field of
like what research we need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how this whole process kind
of works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think sometimes people make
observations and they jump through the
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: They jump past the scientific method and
make a claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go straight from hypothesis to
conclusion without running a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really hard not to when
you're in a facility or in a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room, because, like you said,
if you see something and you get a result
[SPEAKER_00]: that you like, you want to repeat that
result over and over again and just in
[SPEAKER_00]: your head, make an assumption for what's
actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may not be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's a that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's we got way off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to bring that all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was it was something on my mind
when you brought up plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to it, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other what other research was shared
at the conference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other thing that took me by
surprise, again, normally, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm when they're talking about disease
stuff, I'm off doodling and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the mere stuff is just so
interesting because past the Hopsley and
[SPEAKER_02]: Viroid onto viruses is the viruses they're
finding, which tobacco mosaic virus,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I've known to have been a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was actually kind of surprised that
when I mentioned this to a group of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growers, they didn't think that
tobacco, I mean, that cannabis got tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess there's still a myth out there
circulating that it doesn't really get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, over sampling over like 2000
plants, they found 53 samples with tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that I was surprised about was I
did not know that cannabis could get
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco streak virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually had 56 samples of
tobacco streak virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was surprising to me because,
again, I I honestly didn't know too much
[SPEAKER_02]: about tobacco streak virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, immediately to the Internet
to go learn and read about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At lower levels, they did found a rabis
mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found tomato bushy stunt virus,
cucumber mosaic virus and very low,
[SPEAKER_02]: low amounts of like alfalfa mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, looking at all their samples
and everything that it basically kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: came back to out of all their samples,
about seven percent of the plants they
[SPEAKER_02]: tested carried a virus, not a Viroid,
but a virus of some kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the viruses are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some of them can be test
for with a Lysa test kits that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can get from companies like
idea, which, you know, most of my
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental and vegetable growers keep
those test kits in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're always available in case they
need to test right then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is something that can be causing
some problems that you may be mistaking
[SPEAKER_02]: for nutritional or other issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the viruses are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't discount those on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, with Zamir too,
and I can I don't know if I send it to you
[SPEAKER_02]: or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually put out a really good
publication with the disease stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have it, I'll send you a link
and then you can link it out or attach it,
[SPEAKER_02]: however you do your Internet magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I highly recommend if you ever have a
chance to hear Zamir speak, he he does an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing job presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to try and get him on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody that knows him that could
probably get him on the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I you are my main source of podcast
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the the tobacco mosaics virus
stuff sort of came from no one actually
[SPEAKER_00]: having an actual test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like, like you said,
the growers making observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we finally got in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've seen tests that actually
show that it is showing up in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because I for the longest time didn't
think it was an actual cannabis disease
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one ever actually had a test to
support their claim around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes me wonder when you say all
the viruses, I wonder how many times
[SPEAKER_00]: people have thrown out a potential
promising cultivar because it
[SPEAKER_00]: underperformed and maybe it wasn't even
the the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but sometimes viruses can improve
plants, too.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I just wonder how that's
affected our genetic choices by breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we might have to do a show on
viruses now that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given you my my virus knowledge of
limited again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is really outside of my
comfort zone because I like to stick with
[SPEAKER_02]: my bugs, but I find it very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously there is a correlation with
things that do get vectored by insects and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, because can you touch on
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the main diseases that you
would see vectored by in cannabis by top
[SPEAKER_00]: curly virus?
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast only East Coast people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have dodged a huge bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Coast guys, if you're not familiar
with beat top curly virus and its vector,
[SPEAKER_02]: you you really need to be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was talk after talk after talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some of them that talked about
how it has messed up their field trial
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, a researcher out in
California, she got it in her hemp trial
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and it's it's vectored by the beat
leafhopper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all up and down the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think one of the more interesting
things I found out about this is some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the researchers commented when they tried
to rear the beat leafhopper just on hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it sounds like is happening because
this is actually an insect that feeds on
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple plants and it's picking up the
virus as it's feeding out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hops onto a hemp plant, you know,
sticks its mouth part in because they have
[SPEAKER_02]: a piercing sucking mouth part,
feeds a bit, transmits and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, no, and then leaves the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not like hemp is its primary
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of I don't want to say is
accidentally getting it, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just it's it's it's feeding and getting
off and it's spreading it now in other
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: How they manage this is they get rid of
the weeds back to the problem with outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you're growing 20
plants, sure, you can hand weed when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting into 500 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: of hemp, you're not hand weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and now you've got the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got weeds taking over your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've got weeds that can have the
virus and host your vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just all downhill from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's it's a multipronged issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the key to management seems to be is,
you know, managing the weeds in the area
[SPEAKER_02]: that have it on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything we can do for
leafhoppers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I cannot stand those little
buggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drive me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any control options?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned weed removal, but like in my
home garden, they were a terror this last
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I would get into which ones
were they and what kind of damage were
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually doing kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I hate to say natural pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you run the risk of, you know,
kind of disrupting any bio program you
[SPEAKER_02]: have out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where crop covers can also be used
to get same methods we used for like flea
[SPEAKER_02]: beetle management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where you put floating row covers over
and things like that to to exclude them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as biological or softer
products with the softer products,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be natural pyrethrins and
soaps and they don't persist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to be continually
treating for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they fly away so quickly,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to hit them with the adults,
challenging the adults because the
[SPEAKER_02]: amateurs don't have wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I guess I need to go back and even
look what an amateur looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just notice the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I'll shake my sunflowers and
they'll just it'll be like a cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're not causing any
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they a problem or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And and in the case of hemp for Western
United States, especially in the warmer
[SPEAKER_02]: areas, yes, it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I've got tons of leafhoppers
here on my property.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go photograph them every day and
they are of no economic importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do damage to any of my plants
here.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point for anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one you guys get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about ticks the other
day on the phone, so don't get me started
[SPEAKER_00]: on issues with the East Coast and
disasters and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to it, though,
are there any other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we move on from leafhoppers,
do they vector anything else besides that
[SPEAKER_00]: virus?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not that I know of at this time,
but again, as time goes on and these
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers are doing more of their
surveys, we'll find more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's really the only one right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is, you know, of what I'd
consider major economic importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what about my spider mites,
root aphids, temp russet broads,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other more common cannabis
pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those vectoring any pathogens or other
diseases potentially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we know fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a list of diseases they can
vector, and that's because the larva feeds
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pick up the pathogens in their gut
and then when they're adults and they fly
[SPEAKER_02]: around and poop, they deposit on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's well known, well studied,
and that's why it's so important to manage
[SPEAKER_02]: your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know in cannabis of anything,
any of the mites are vectoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whiteflies can vector virus,
but so far nothing in hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really that's you know,
most of the other viruses are more
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical in nature of being vectored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're spreading it most likely with our
clothes, our scissors, our hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, our watering,
all of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, can you talk again about you mentioned
natural pyrethrins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about
pyrethrins, the pros and cons around them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I still hear some some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chosen not to use them in my garden,
but people get this idea that because a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is natural, in this case,
I think from the chrysanthemum or this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of planting African chrysanthemums,
they'll get pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just kind of talk a little bit
about all of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so there's pyrethrins, as you said,
and those are derived from a chrysanthemum
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be very careful when you
read your labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyrethrins are more expensive because
they're naturally extracted out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyrethroids are what has been synthesized
in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a synthetic version of it where they
can make it very inexpensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pyrethroid, the synthetic,
is much more stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that is sprayed on a crop,
we cannot reintroduce beneficials in there
[SPEAKER_02]: for typically two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the persistence of that on the
plant, at least eight weeks is what we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural pyrethrins that are, you know,
in like pyganic, those are not nearly as
[SPEAKER_02]: stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those tend to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this can be very variable depending on
overhead irrigation or drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in Maine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in Florida?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, UV heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to at least wait a week,
maybe 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can, again, depend on which
beneficial you're using before you get
[SPEAKER_02]: back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoors under artificial lighting with no
overhead irrigation, they can persist much
[SPEAKER_02]: longer than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, since they are one of our
earlier pesticides, pyrethrins and then
[SPEAKER_02]: again, we developed the pyrethroids have
been used so heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of resistance issues in the
sense that they may not even work on your
[SPEAKER_02]: target pests because the pest has had so
much exposure to them that they possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: have developed resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be sometimes a little bit of a
crapshoot whether the product's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: work or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're very non-selective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to kill your beneficials just
as much as pests if, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's not selective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what makes my job challenging
because I want to be environmental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why I do my job is to
reduce pest use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we start looking at what I call
some of these new designer pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think salt and miticide is a really good
example from BASF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, cannabis growers can't use it,
but ornamental growers can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry vegetables, they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you have a strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say you've got two-spot spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come in and spray it with sultan
and it is only going to kill, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: five or six spider mite species are on the
label and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything for broad mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything for russets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything to any other
insects or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't hurt the predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's dialed in just for those handful
of mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can spray that and then use our
beneficials in conjunction with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flip to the flip side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to be organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: You come in and so we're going to spray a
natural pyrethrin like pyganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blown out your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may or may not even kill your spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually pyrethrins, pyrethrodes are
known for actually causing spider mite
[SPEAKER_02]: flares, which is a whole nother
discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could actually make your your issue
worth, but you're being organic and in
[SPEAKER_02]: theory being better for the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're going to have to retreat
again and retreat again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard sometimes because
these new designer products are so
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted to just kill a few different
insects and not be broad spectrum killers
[SPEAKER_02]: where a lot of the more natural products
are very broad spectrum in their nature in
[SPEAKER_02]: killing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a tough, you know, walking this
road sometimes on making recommendations
[SPEAKER_02]: for me because we get these new targeted
products that, again, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be registered for cannabis stuff or
approved for use in different states,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for ornamentals and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can just with pinpoint accuracy go
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of to me like the difference of
how, you know, we're doing targeted
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy today where they can just put
it in one spot where the old days you
[SPEAKER_02]: would inject it and get it throughout your
entire body and have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there can be a place for
natural pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for home gardeners that just,
oh, we have a little little spot here we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for cannabis, because many
states do allow it for use, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: consequences to using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it will blow out your
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be iffy on its persistence indoors
and it can definitely last longer indoors
[SPEAKER_02]: than out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's too broad spectrum for me in a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any issues, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned this, you know,
these more selective options that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I necessarily trust all
these large ag companies to have my best
[SPEAKER_00]: interest from a health perspective in mind
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And small organic companies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, we've already seen that in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always bring up Guardian Mind
Spray because it's such a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been other companies out
there, too, that have put out products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we you know, are there any
issues, first of all, with pyrethrins in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of human toxicology or safety if
we're going to be combusting, inhaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating our product, like if I was going to
use this on my vegetables or things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let me ask you that question first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a couple others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not a medical doctor and I don't
really study or understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's not my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that it does break down in UV
sunlight outside relatively quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to other compounds and it can be
washed off plants, it's not systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that is something right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to spray it on your
strawberries, since we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, you can just wash it off if
you're concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you know, the label is the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you have your REI and this
is really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a commercial grower,
you have REIs and then you also have
[SPEAKER_02]: post-harvest intervals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So REI is you can spray it and then how
long before you can go back into that area
[SPEAKER_02]: to work for your safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then post-harvest is, OK, you spray it
and how long before you can harvest your
[SPEAKER_02]: your goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that information is available on
homeowner pesticides, only commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides, even though oftentimes it's
the same active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a homeowner doesn't have as much active
access or cannabis growers that are buying
[SPEAKER_02]: homeowner products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have as much access to as much
information on safety as commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: growers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the regulation is just not as
strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same thing around is it's
25B, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the 25B exempt from EPA
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because you will see companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're both just at MJBizCon,
for example, you'll go to a convention
[SPEAKER_00]: show or you'll see you'll look online,
you'll see this product that claims that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, all safe ingredients or
all natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically just means it's most
likely registering as a 25B product where
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't fall under that EPA
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just some marketing terms around
there that can make it confusing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, for growers to really understand
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk a little about 25B and why
you tend to gravitate away from those
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I look at them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not turn a product away from
looking at it because I'm still hoping
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll find and there are some there are
some products out there that have some
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, the EPA decided that there
is a group of food grade inputs,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically, that if you want to make a
pesticide out of them, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: kill yourself in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are allowing you to companies
to scoot around EPA registration,
[SPEAKER_02]: which EPA registration in the United
States is about I think we're at like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years to get a product to market about 10
million dollars because you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: prove bee safety, human safety,
you know, all these different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, tests they have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the 25B basically, I mean,
if I wanted to, I could go to my kitchen,
[SPEAKER_02]: take my 25B list, which, you know,
has, you know, like soybean oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think corn oils on there, rosemary oil,
and I can make that into a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can call it bug lady bug killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then depending on the state,
like some states you go to, they want you
[SPEAKER_02]: to register.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, that's just filling out a
paperwork saying you're going to sell it
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a super easy process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, I can make any claims in
theory that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say it's safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficials only kills pests, you know,
and all these different claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the EPA doesn't care about efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're not going to kill
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or totally destroy the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of like go, go do what you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where there's been this whole
crop of products spring up that don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the level of testing that most pesticides
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, challenging because
people can say whatever they want,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're getting away with it for right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've done some tests with growers
actually on a few products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't obviously name the names of
those products here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you found not only were a lot of these
products more expensive, but you noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity issues, not actual control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it might knock back a little bit
some of the insect populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'd see a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've we've talked about this
before off air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not throwing a gun at you,
but again, all these products out with the
[SPEAKER_02]: bath water.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we're testing two 25B products at
one of my facilities, ornamental
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually spraying them on full color
poinsettias because full color poinsettias
[SPEAKER_02]: are super, super sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of like, you know,
the skin of a redhead is the best way to
[SPEAKER_02]: put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are testing them not only for
phytotoxicity, but we're also testing for
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if these products potentially could
be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I'm super interested in the 25B
is a finding one is because we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a reentry interval, which can be very
challenging for some of my greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities that run three shifts a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shutdown time to spray
pesticides and also for dipping cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, I mean, the most famous
research study was done with SufoilX up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, dipping cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing how amazing it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: No phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's one of the best things you
can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the United States, dipping is not
on the label yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been at the EPA for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, legally, my growers cannot
take their cuttings, dip them in Sufoil
[SPEAKER_02]: and root them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though that is one of the best way to
stop, you know, like hemp russet mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: two spot spider mites and broad mites from
even getting started.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 25Bs, you don't have the restrictions
of an EPA label.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can just let's try dipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try drenching.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can try all these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not illegal because they don't
have restrictive labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are testing a couple of products
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have high hopes for these because of
the amount of research these companies
[SPEAKER_02]: have put into these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not just somebody making it at
their house and, you know, spelling the
[SPEAKER_02]: insects wrong on the labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like six years ago, I was at, oh,
which trade show was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in, I think it was, I almost said
Comic-Con.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the wrong show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong completely at Canicon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I was looking at some of these
25B products and they didn't even have the
[SPEAKER_02]: pest spelled right on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: The packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, how can I take this product
seriously when you can't even spell the
[SPEAKER_02]: name right on your product?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it was a typo in an email
you sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the printed label of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I really would start talking to
these guys and these 25B products,
[SPEAKER_02]: they bailed on the conversation and don't
want to talk to me because I'm asking the
[SPEAKER_02]: tough questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most of these 25B products are non
selective.
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally are going to kill the pests
just as equally as beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do have to be cautious with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you said the price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was calculating some of the
prices and, you know, for $60 of soft oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: for some of these 25Bs, it's almost $400
for the same amount of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada does not allow this to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada doesn't have this exemption list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in Canada, if you want to register a
product in Canada, you have to prove at
[SPEAKER_02]: least 80% efficacy to get the product
labeled up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pick up our conversation next time
on the podcast.
