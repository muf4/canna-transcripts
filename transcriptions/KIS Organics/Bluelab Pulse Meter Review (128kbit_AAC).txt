[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Bluelab Pulse Meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to be able to add it to
our lineup of products at Kiss Organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have the best price online.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter is not for everyone,
but here's what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures moisture, conductivity,
or EC, and temperature directly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone with one click.
[SPEAKER_00]: It connects to the Bluelab Pulse app to
view, analyze, and store all your
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app's available in English,
Spanish, Dutch, German, and Korean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a built-in depth gauge to get
consistent measurements with every
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in soil, coco core, nutrient
solution, and living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how and why would you want something
like this for your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, it will quickly measure
moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is waterproof, unlike the Blumap
Moisture Meter, and I love that I can get
[SPEAKER_00]: a reading immediately, instead of having
to wait for a while between readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means I can use one meter and check
multiple pots or beds in a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds to see how evenly I'm watering,
or if I have any dry spots, or if any
[SPEAKER_00]: containers got missed when watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it tells me EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC is a measurement of electrical
conductivity in your soil, which is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: way of seeing what level of fertility you
have in your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cations like calcium, magnesium,
potassium, sodium, and ammonium,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as anions like sulfur,
chloride, nitrates, and bicarbonates,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all salts that when dissolved in
solution in soils will carry electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: charges and currents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, too high of an EC will potentially
put osmotic pressure on your roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about getting it into the proper
range, and we really want a soil test so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can determine what is making up the
salt concentration in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will give us a rough idea of
fertility in our soil mix if we know all
[SPEAKER_00]: our inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And staying within certain EC ranges,
typically 0.7 to 2.8, will allow for good
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial activity and important soil
processes like respiration and
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that several factors can
affect soil EC, such as moisture content,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil structure, and the presence of
dissolved salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the soil moisture increases,
so will your EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I get an idea of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold root zone temperatures can inhibit
plant growth, and the uptake of many
[SPEAKER_00]: essential nutrients like phosphorus and
too high of soil temps can make it easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant pathogens to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently calibrating it with my blue
mat moisture meter, and will be comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with an aerometer here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is the iPhone app that comes
along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it on Android as well,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app is called Pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's available in multiple
languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, I just push the button on
the pulse meter itself to connect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It connects quickly via Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, I don't have to
keep reconnecting with every calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: or every every photo I want to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just click the measure button and then I
can go in as I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can add a photo to that measurement,
as well as any notes that I may want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a good place I can add,
say, the the VPD in the room at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: any pest pressures I may dealing with when
I watered and and keep track of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that right here in the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice little kind of like journal
in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this could get complicated in a
facility where you have multiple plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have the ability to export the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a facility, for example,
you could just measure one room,
[SPEAKER_00]: export that data and then keep the files
somewhere else associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I just have them using it in
this room, I can go back through
[SPEAKER_00]: historically and look at my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time you see an orange dot there
next to the recording, that tells me that
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a picture or added extra notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really handy feature to
quickly go back through and look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: was going on in the room at that time for
tracking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, not for everyone, but if you're
into data, this is a really cool tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could potentially help you in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see what I was doing here
was I was comparing the 35 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in this case correlated
approximately with my blue mat moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it said I was at about 75 m
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've been playing around with this
for a little while and getting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements to kind of get an idea of EC
and moisture level and how those things
[SPEAKER_00]: relate to, say, something like the blue
mat moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find I probably want to be around 35
to 45 percent is a moisture range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably correlates to about 80,
let's say 70 to 90 in terms of m bar
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one other cool feature here,
I can now export this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can send it to someone or I can save it
to a file or email it to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's another really great
feature associated with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can configure it based on the type of
media you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I just configured it to a
mixed media for living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Blue Lab Pulse Meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I covered the pros and cons,
as well as why someone might want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this tool in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking out my review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go to KISOrganics.com to learn
more or order one for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
