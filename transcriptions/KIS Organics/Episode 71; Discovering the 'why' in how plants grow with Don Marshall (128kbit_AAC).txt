[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited to share my interview this
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the privilege of interviewing Don
Marshall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don is a good friend, a spirited educator,
landscape designer, and horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: professional who established one of the
top horticulture programs in Washington
[SPEAKER_02]: State over 40 years ago at Lake Washington
Institute of Technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to teaching, Don is a
certified professional horticulturalist,
[SPEAKER_02]: eco-pro, and certified arborist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He owns and operates Plant Designs,
a landscape design, installation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maintenance firm specializing in
organic fine gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now retired from teaching, he is enjoying
growing for himself and his extended
[SPEAKER_02]: family and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went back to school two years
ago when I heard he was retiring just so I
[SPEAKER_02]: could take his classes on botany as he is
one of the most knowledgeable people and
[SPEAKER_02]: best educators I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so grateful he agreed to come on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now before starting the show, I did want
to share a cool cannabis resource worth
[SPEAKER_02]: checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good conversation with Nick over
at Growers Network on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a few channels which include
Canna Cribs, Deep Roots, and the Canna
[SPEAKER_02]: Cribs podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the episode where they toured
Yerba Buena in Oregon and it was cool to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the inside of their growing operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to share that so folks could
check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Don, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Ted, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I wanted to start off talking a
little bit about your background.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've shared a little bit off air with me
about how you got into horticulture and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you share a little of that with our
audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kind of an odd background in that I
was interested in plants from age five and
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanted to work with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mowed lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in nurseries even as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it came time to go to college,
of course, I wanted to go to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to the University of New
Hampshire and I was majoring in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: science and I was just loving it,
except I felt like I was getting only
[SPEAKER_00]: science, only science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even asked my botany instructor,
could you relate this to a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was insulted.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the problem came up when the
plant science instructor intro said that
[SPEAKER_00]: we must put a 5-10-10 fertilizer in a
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I raised my hand and I said,
is this really necessary in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically pulled me in his office
after school and said, there's no place in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state university for someone like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a rough two years there,
science-based, science-based,
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quit and moved to Seattle and worked
in the industry, worked in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery in Seattle and for a couple of
years had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I became increasingly unhappy with the
wonderful practitioners that I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with because I kept saying, well,
why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd say, just do what you're told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you have to ask why all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was now frustrated that I couldn't
understand the science part of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to WSU and finished my degree,
got a dual major in education as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a student taught it and I hated
teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated the whole scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to work in the industry after
college and worked for a while until I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard Lake Washington was going to start a
work program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I literally walked in, sight
unseen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no job posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I understand you're thinking
of starting a work program and I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, really, sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 40 years later, I just retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interesting thing is I had the
opportunity to marry the science and the
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, which is what the college
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it was a gift from heaven
because I could always be challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: people to say, why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to, you're pruned here because
the plant does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a very great situation for
me because I could always be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides of the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know so many people who have been
through your program locally that are now
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful horticulturalists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had such an impact on this area
here in terms of the education that you
[SPEAKER_02]: delivered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: To talk about some of the stuff that I've
learned from you, from the classes I've
[SPEAKER_02]: taken from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about some of these basic
plant concepts and the why that you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned from a plant physiology
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What one would you like to start with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we had talked off air about root
hairs and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's something we could start on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to back up just a hair,
I think as a grower, as someone working
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants every day, you need to be a
critical thinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to really be a discerning
practitioner, trying to teach yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: what is actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk of root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs are a great example because if
I over-fertilize, sorry, I've got some in
[SPEAKER_00]: my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I over-fertilize a plant, then the
result is I get marginal leaf necrosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: dead tissue on the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I over-water a plant, I get yellow
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I under-water a plant,
then I get a lot of yellow leaves and I
[SPEAKER_00]: even get marginal leaf necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a view of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's looking at a situation and saying,
what is wrong with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go down to the soil level,
when you go down to the root level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see really what's going on is root
hair death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And root hairs, let's remember for your
audience, root hairs are an extension of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root epidermis that is one cell thick,
one cell thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all the moisture is
coming, all the water is coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the nutrients are doing their anion
and cation exchange and all this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's quite a bit of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's at the root hair level,
not the root-let level, not the small root
[SPEAKER_00]: level, it's at the microscopic root hair,
which is one cell thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you over-fertilize a plant,
you have moisture coming out of the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and dehydrating and the cells die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those root hairs dying doesn't allow
the plant to take up moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing that happens in
dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the same thing that happens in
over-watering because you have root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's an example of what happens
when roots are damaged due to
[SPEAKER_00]: over-watering, under-watering,
over-fertilizing, high salt content in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the top growth look exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're a practitioner,
we often will say, well, it's because you
[SPEAKER_00]: over-watered the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what was going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You over-watered the plant and the plant
suffocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't suffocate, it's root
hair death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually over-watering causes drought
stress, just as over-watering causes
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiency because of root hair,
because they can't take up nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: through the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now root hairs, of course, are rejuvenated
very quickly and things can come back
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, you're getting
yellowing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, you're getting marginal
leaf necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just getting some weird stuff that
as the discerning practitioner,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to kind of step back and say,
OK, think critically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is actually happening here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the history?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my employee doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning this person has a tendency to
over-water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I find with employees or
students is that at first they over-water
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and that's three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they under-water everything and
that's three months until they find that
[SPEAKER_00]: happy median.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it takes time to develop
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time to say, can you look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just say water Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, that may not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that may not be the same in the
different areas of the growing room or the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, because you've got fans in
this area and you've got a dead spot in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That area, meaning that there's no air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our structures, our growing
structures have all kinds of microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impacts water and nutrient
absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of rambling here, but no,
that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back and touch on two things
that you said that I thought were really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was that over-watering causes drought
stress because it has the exact same
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on root hairs and root hair root
hair death, because that's just so
[SPEAKER_02]: contrary to your thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think you're, like you said,
you're suffocating the plant, but actually
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a drought stress issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really interesting and I
want to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing that you touched on in
there that I think is interesting is this
[SPEAKER_02]: marginal leaf necrosis, that same
symptomatic effect that you get on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, regardless of what the condition
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you listed over-fertilization,
high salt, under and over-watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally in the industry,
people will immediately say, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll look at either applying,
well, Cal Mag, which is not even a
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient, you know, it's two nutrients,
or nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those seem to be the two main things I
hear a lot of times in those cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, what you're saying is it could
be sufficient in the soil and really an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue of uptake related to root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be root hair death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And root hair, remember, everything is
going through the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lack of root hairs, damage to root
hairs, death of root hairs will manifest
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in the above ground portion as
either a deficiency or a wilting or a
[SPEAKER_00]: gray-green color in the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the foliage and it's like it
doesn't have that vibrant green that it
[SPEAKER_00]: should.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an off color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we even get this off color
and we blame it on a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in fact, the fungus is an
opportunistic organism that is living off
[SPEAKER_00]: of dead roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it didn't kill the plant or
it isn't attacking the plant, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: attacking dead tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really one of those things where
you have to kind of become a Sherlock
[SPEAKER_00]: Holmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I encourage people when I was
teaching them to walk in your facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a greenhouse or a grow room
or whatever, every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even before people come, even before you
get your day going, when you're walking
[SPEAKER_00]: around with your coffee and just do a
wellness check.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everybody doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of walk around and take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with the task of writing a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get this done or this done or
that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of a well person check,
you know, as they do in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay or not okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to be worried here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that totally can help you catch
things early and then become a teacher to
[SPEAKER_00]: your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to whoever's working with you on,
take a look at this because what you do is
[SPEAKER_00]: you empower people and yourself when you
can figure this out early and catch it
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see a plant or a section of
plants that has an issue going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's sort of your mental checklist?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've already talked a little
bit about watering and over fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you start narrowing down the
variables to getting to what the real,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the root of the problem is no
pun intended?
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start looking around and I start going,
yeah, this is my, this is my quiet zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning there's no air circulation in this
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're not, they're not trying
out as fast as the ones over by the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just start really looking at my
environment because so many of our
[SPEAKER_00]: problems are environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a greenhouse, so many of our
problems are environmental because maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter time we're not getting the
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're not doing an air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're worrying about heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore we don't want to do an
air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an air exchange causes a buildup of
humidity, which causes them not to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: as much moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're watering them the same as we
were in July when we were having more air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement or more air exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the way you start that is you
just become very aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop the sixth sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of walking around, looking at the
facility, looking at the plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three are all in the same corner or
these are not in the same corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in three opposite areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the commonality here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to do it when you're fret.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it at five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to do it when you first
walk in, when your energy level's high,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're not stressed with,
with people saying, what do I do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what needs to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what needs to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you kind of have to take a
breath, walk around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I could walk around and say,
how's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really start with it with a,
with a well plant check and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and you have more confidence to
tell people, this is what needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hey, what's going on in these corners?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often, when do you have that timer
set?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when are you watering by hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often are you watering these?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm seeing is a gray greenness to the
color, to the plant, not that vibrant
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any chance you're overwatering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though in your head, you know about
the root hair stuff, you could explain
[SPEAKER_00]: them if the employee is interested or if
they're, you know, the person is
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's, it's important to
gather all the information and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really dive into what's, what's
potentially going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my head, I'm thinking about the
fact that I, every day I see people
[SPEAKER_02]: posting pictures of their plants online
asking, you know, essentially that what's
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong with my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a standard answer of,
I can't diagnose plants from a photo just
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't really feel you,
you can fully diagnose a situation from a
[SPEAKER_02]: photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just see people getting answers and
jumping to conclusions and making pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: big changes in how they're maintaining
their plants based off of this
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what you're saying here is
that there's a lot more information out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that we need to gather before we can
really determine what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we haven't even discussed is
the need to not only look at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, but knock it out of the pot,
knock it out of the pot, look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, smell the root mass, feel the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots should be white and should tug.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tug, when you tug on them,
they should tug back a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they should snap or break.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they break off, if they slime in your
hands, you've got root death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What caused that root death?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what's going on up top?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with this root system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's where all of this is going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where, you know,
the, the above ground portion is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the final, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is the result of what
happened in our root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really got to start down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get comfortable knocking stuff
out of their pots without disturbing the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just kind of pick it up with
one hand, tap it with the other hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap the pot with the other hand and the
whole thing comes apart and you look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel it with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the side of the pot where the
roots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you're in a greenhouse,
very often the sunny side of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunny side of the pot has no roots
because they've died and they've all
[SPEAKER_00]: migrated to the cooler side because that
black pot is absorbing so much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, those are things
that you'll notice in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, there's no roots on this half of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all on the north side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe I need to shade that south
side of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of heat coming in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was good, but with that
heat and that black pot, we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging some of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the kinds of things you see
when you, when you knock it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the root hairs, you know,
the root hairs are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are harder to see often because,
you know, again, they're one cell thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an extension of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're root epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But carrying a magnifier is a good thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk to me about root girdling or why
it's important when we transplant plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to break up the roots and how that relates
to this root hair concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and my theory too on,
we have a tendency to put human emotions
[SPEAKER_00]: into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are drowning when, in fact,
plants are responding to their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're doing with, with roots
when we're transplanting is we're knocking
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be scoring the root ball,
which means cutting roots, damaging roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: because remember roots have no nodes and
internodes like a stem does.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stem has nodes and internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that if you cut a stem and
you leave an internode on, it'll die back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the node and then the node will sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typical, you know, above ground
dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, below there's no nodes and
internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever you cut it, they're going to
sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you cut it, they're going to,
they're going to branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to send out roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A root system once established in its
position will stay in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you take that six inch pot and
you put it in a five gallon container and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't score the root mass,
then most of the roots are going to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in that six inch pot and continue to get
six inch thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will venture out as opposed to if we
took that six inch pot, we scored the root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball in four places and the bottom,
or we ripped off some roots and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would suddenly branch where we broke it
and they would score and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: venture out into the new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big mistake I see is that people
take a two inch plant or a cutting and
[SPEAKER_00]: they put it in a gigantic pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often they say, well,
I did it and really I'm not getting any
[SPEAKER_00]: top growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better be fertilizing more or I better
be watering more or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in fact the cutting is actually
filling up that pot slowly with roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not seeing a lot of top growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is I like to go from
a cutting to maybe a four or a cutting to
[SPEAKER_00]: even a six, let it root, let it establish,
let it grow well, let it fill up that pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil, then bump it up to a five or to
a larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a tendency, keep in mind that
when you've got a cutting and you put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in this gigantic tub and you continue to
water it, or if you water it heavily,
[SPEAKER_00]: that water, plants thrive on that air
water relationship where they get watered,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take up the water, it dries out,
there's oxygen, they need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the air around there, remember
oxygen is a part of respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that's how they're getting
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And respiration is not breathing,
it's converting that sugar that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has into energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by keeping that soil mass super
saturated, because you've got this cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: in a 20 gallon container, you start to get
less oxygen, you start to get less
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, and you start to get less growth
and slower growth and root growth that is
[SPEAKER_00]: being hindered and hampered by too much
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, it all goes down to air,
water, relationships, it all goes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: root hair, life, and then hence the need
to score the root ball prior to moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into a larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a long-winded answer,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you describe what you mean by scoring
for people who may not be familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: that term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, scoring is a term where you can take
a hoary hoary or you can take a pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: shears or a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're in production,
you don't have time to be fussing with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and teasing the roots and all the kind of
stuff that a homeowner might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so scoring is simply taking a hoary
hoary or a knife or a pair of shears and
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the root system in maybe four
places and the bottom and doing it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: timely fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaching is always susceptible to
criticism and people would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, in industry, we don't have time to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in touch with reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you don't have time to do it
well, then maybe you shouldn't be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I really feel like you can balance
doing it well, doing it fast and doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so proper scoring is really if you're
moving right along, you can do the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do four sides, you can put it in a
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about teasing,
taking 10 extra minutes with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for this because I'm
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're busy, so am I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you score it, you move on,
you score it, and you move on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we have to sacrifice
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we have to sacrifice doing
it right because you don't understand I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do it fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd say we have the other problem
with cannabis cultivation where people see
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant and they want to be so cautious
and careful and gentle with it that they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't score the roots enough in a lot of
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm used to dealing with industry
that is like, well, we're not being fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not being fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those who are scoring too much,
you don't need to take all that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to do it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe four spots is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, wherever you cut,
it's going to branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about the top
growth where it's like, well, go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: node, go to a node.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to leave an inner node.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's above ground pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is below ground pruning where it's
just like, just cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see these photos online of roots just
wrapped over and around each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely filling a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: As people use as good examples of root
growth, but that's not what we want from a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about why root
girdling is bad or why that might not be
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root girdling goes down to water and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root girdling is basically strangling or
cutting off the vascular system of other
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, roots increase in girth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a meristematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lateral meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lateral layer of tissue that
is growing in girth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it grows in girth, and you have two
growing in girth, they're causing
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like staking a plant above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it increases in girth, if that
twist tie or whatever you've used to
[SPEAKER_00]: attach it is not loosened, then the stem
basically starts to become girdled or
[SPEAKER_00]: strangled and it impacts water and
nutrient flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why girdling is bad,
because it's impacting water and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why the need every stage of
repotting is necessary to do that scoring
[SPEAKER_00]: or that cutting of roots so that they can
expand, so they can go into their new
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of roots is seeking out water
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything you do to not help that
happen is going to impact top growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to highlight, you brought up
something that we hadn't talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: before, but I have struggled to explain
well when on the phone with people in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the need to transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people want to skip that
intermediate transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's assume you're growing in a bed or a
large pot as your final flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether a tomato or cannabis, people want
to go straight from a four inch into that
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, like you said, or from a clone into
that large plant, because it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: less labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just, I know you kind of covered
this, but could you just highlight again
[SPEAKER_02]: the reason why those transplants are so
critical from a plant health perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that really they've got to go
back to remembering it's all about air
[SPEAKER_00]: water relationships in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so putting that plant into a six or a
gallon is going to let that cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to let it fill up that pot with
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to knock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, wow, nice roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put it into the 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into the bed because you know
you're putting something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is we get loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have plant loss when you put a cutting
into a 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually because of overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that that soil mass,
especially if you have an organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, that soil mass is a sponge and
it's just holding on to all that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: and not allowing that air water
relationship, which is encouraging the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really wise to do that
next stage, which is to take that cutting,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a gallon, let them establish,
then move them into the 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be ahead by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would also be able to rogue out plants
that are not establishing and some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that has wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes cuttings just don't root
well for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you thought it looked pretty good,
but then you put it in the one gallon and
[SPEAKER_00]: it died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a lot less flavor than moving
it to the 30 and then having it die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these holes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's wiser to take that interim
step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would add that to me, it seems like,
too, when you go from the too small a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in a large pot, like you said,
that pot may still be heavy and feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: it has a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that area right around in the root
zone, which is a pretty small area,
[SPEAKER_02]: may be completely dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to water,
especially when you're watering on scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's say you had 50 or 100 of these
plants that you had to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really hard to water them
effectively when they're really small
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to the mass of soil that they're
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say, and sometimes
the rooting media is a different texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And structure than your planting and
growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that difference of media,
often the the rooting media maybe is
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't want to take in moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the and yet the growing mass is
super saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they're not crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not crossing those barriers
because of the repelling of the water
[SPEAKER_00]: going on from the rooting media to the
growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that brings up another important
point when transplanting into the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: or into a different media.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing my dad's always emphasized with
me is that it's really important to remove
[SPEAKER_02]: that barrier between the two media by
mixing in some of the native soil or the
[SPEAKER_02]: new media in with the old that the plant
is in so that the roots will want to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: out of their current media into the other
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of remove that barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even when I was in college,
we were taught, you know, you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you get rid of the soil and you put
in good growing media into the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the into the ground so that the plant
will root and establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what science shows later is that
basically that's a pot inside the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so absolutely your dad's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take and and and co-mingle the
two, the new and the old, even in a
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape you know, they're saying organic
matter, you know, add compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: add compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you dig a hole and you add a
plant and then you backfill it with
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, the root system will stay in that
nice soil structure of the compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: won't venture into the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, you want to mix the new soil with
the old soil or the new soil with the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing soil so that the root system say,
oh, this is the same texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go from one one texture into
another one structure into another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're putting human characteristics
into a plant, but that's just for the sake
[SPEAKER_00]: of discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been talking about everything
sort of below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk a little bit about what's
going on above ground with a plant as it
[SPEAKER_02]: grows?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, I don't know where to start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could talk about plant growth
from a hormonal perspective or we could
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about them from, say, a pruning or
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on when you when you when you
cut at a node or, you know, in an inner
[SPEAKER_02]: node?
[SPEAKER_02]: What what would you want to tackle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two are those those two kind of go
hand in hand, meaning why are we pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: and why what's actually happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the apical meristem,
the growing point that the terminal bud of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant has hormones growing in it and
or the hormones growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones are produced in that apical
meristem, which is the growing point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the top of the Christmas tree,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the layers inside the bud of the
top of the Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you take away the let's
go to the top of the Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends in these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those buds, those buds are covered
by bud scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep inside those bud scales is an apical
meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's it's a group of cells that are
kind of your wonder cells and they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that starts there is
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many hormones, not all of them,
but one group called auctions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a group of hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those auctions control lateral
growth and terminal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those auctions basically tell that
apical meristem we're growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tip of a Christmas tree keeps
growing straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farther you get away from those
auctions, that terminal bud, that apical
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem, farther you get away,
the less impact those hormones have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you start to get branching
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you get branching below that
where those auctions are not impacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by pruning, by removing the apical
meristem, you basically remove that
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's called apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remove that control and you get
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're pruning, we'll go to a node
and the node is where the bud comes out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem and the internode is the distance
between buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to a node and you prune it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut it above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: It branches, meaning the bud just below
where you've above where you've below
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've pruned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to grow and the one below that
starts to grow and the one below that
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those start to grow and get larger and
they in turn have an apical meristem and
[SPEAKER_00]: they control their own lateral growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, if you want those side
branches to branch, then you tip out that
[SPEAKER_00]: apical meristem as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that with fusions, for instance,
where we let them grow a couple nodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we tip them and then they branch and
then we let those branches grow a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes and then we tip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we let those branches grow a
couple nodes and then we tip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're trying to encourage
bushiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this pruning is successful because
of hormones that are encouraging and that
[SPEAKER_00]: are inhibiting branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a cannabis perspective,
by removing or limiting by pinching,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, the amount of auxins coming
out of that, the apical meristem,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're allowing other branches to grow and
getting a fuller canopy is essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: what what you're getting at more of like
a, I guess, a candelabra design versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to use visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good choice of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candelabra is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by pinching, you develop the
candelabra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop the bush by not pinching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a Christmas tree telephone pole
and it will eventually branch lower once
[SPEAKER_00]: those hormones have less impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get a strong what's called apical
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dominance of that apical meristem
to control the lateral growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what apical dominance is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we get this bushier plant,
we're getting a lot of interior branching
[SPEAKER_02]: and lower branching, which may not be have
access, the same access to light and
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why what is the importance of pruning a
plant and removing those branches or
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves from a plant health perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less light down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less airflow down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you want to keep in mind is when
you take that branch out to the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin on the stem, you're not encouraging
any more lateral growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just took that side shoot and cut
it back, you're encouraging more lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain that again?
[SPEAKER_02]: So or say that one more time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that I fully caught that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a plant, whether it's
cannabis or whatever, and you've got side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches coming off at the bottom and
you're saying, I want to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to reduce it by 20
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want more light and more air
circulation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that side branch and if you
prune it back to the point of origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean by that is back to the point
where it came out of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, if you prune it back to that point,
then nothing's going to sprout from that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a leaf out leaf there,
that leaf is going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get a new shoot
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to just tip that lateral
branch, it would, in fact, sprout lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would have more bushiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm saying on that side
shoot, if you want to improve light,
[SPEAKER_00]: those lower branches, then you can take it
out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call it the point of origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we see a lot of if we're talking
about an indoor facility would be static
[SPEAKER_02]: light coming from above, from a light,
artificial light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what will happen is we'll create a
canopy using trellis netting that's
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially even and then everything below
a certain point is de-leaved and removed
[SPEAKER_02]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, the branches,
the lateral branches are left and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are just removing the leaves because
essentially they're not getting I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea being they're not getting enough
light and air to where they would be more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a nutrient sink than a photosynthetic
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, except that when you're growing
with light, your quality is often better,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning than the sun, because you often
have less shadows, I believe, less
[SPEAKER_00]: shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really growing strictly in
lights like grow rooms and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that are growing cannabis
in grow rooms and put a light quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: so bright compared to a greenhouse
sometimes, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the actual the actual light
intensity in a greenhouse, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on where you are, is usually can
be quite a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the the spectrums of sunlight allow
for that in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to mitigate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas indoors, the light spectrum has
gotten so much better, especially since
[SPEAKER_02]: you you initially started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that you had lights in
your in your greenhouse out there in at
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake Washington, did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys use supplement?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, first of all, on the prop
bench, we just use cool white fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we were in the process of doing a
lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and my co-teacher that took off took
over after me has done a lot of of
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting and making, you know,
updating and things like that with with
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want to touch on, because this
was something I learned from your class
[SPEAKER_02]: that shocked me was looking at auxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave us this this handout,
I remember, on auxins and light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you maybe you know where I'm going
with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: My my understanding was the exact opposite
of what was actually going on with auxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without without saying it myself,
do you want to kind of explain what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we've all been in situations where
we've put lights by windows or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant bends towards light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's actually going on inside the
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fascinating because we always say,
well, my plant loves my window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bends towards the light or or even even
even under grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the ones on the edges growing
towards pointing towards the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to think the plant is
really enjoying that and bending towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, in fact, the reality is that auxins,
which is a hormone, is responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: cell reproduction, cell enlargement,
cell development, and it also is damaged
[SPEAKER_00]: to the presence of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is auxins migrate to
the shady side of the plant, therefore in
[SPEAKER_00]: causing cell cell reproduction,
cell enlargement, causing that one side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem, the shady side of the plant of
the stem to actually enlarge at a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: rate than the ones on the sunny side,
therefore causing it to be nodding towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun because the back of its neck,
if I can use that analogy, the back of its
[SPEAKER_00]: neck is actually growing faster than the
front than the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn the plant and so that the sun is
so that the pointed part is now in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it evens out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in nature outside, plants don't have
this because the sun is moving across the
[SPEAKER_00]: sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever looked at slow motion
pictures of plants, they're always in a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant state of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually moving in a very small
way and following that sun and hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually moving around the stem in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's kind of a misunderstanding
that people are saying, am I plants
[SPEAKER_00]: bending towards the light, which it is
bending towards the light, but for
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons than what most people
think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the cells are elongating and
growing because of auxins essentially on
[SPEAKER_02]: the shady side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shady side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's a really surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember learning that and being pretty
impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to change subjects again and just
talk a little bit more about how plants
[SPEAKER_02]: eat to use a human term for plants again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you had talked a little bit about
root hairs already, but can we just talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about how the nutrients and
water and a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis too, sort of the important
aspects of how plants grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip the photosynthesis respiration
part at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water and what's going on at the root
hair level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically chemistry goes down to,
I'm trying to summarize all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down to anions and cations,
which are positively charged ions and
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively charged ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that these roots have a homeostasis,
if I can use that word, where there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical balance in the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an active process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tendency to think we water the
plants and they passively suck everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in and all the nutrients with it,
kind of like opening your mouth and having
[SPEAKER_00]: someone pour in a hose and you just kind
of swallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas actually what they've found is
that it's actually much more involved and
[SPEAKER_00]: much more detailed and much more
scientific than that in that plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually carrying on their own cation and
anion exchange with the organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the soil solution, with the minerals
that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are giving off a cation,
they are taking in a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're giving off a positively charged
ion of hydrogen and they're taking up a
[SPEAKER_00]: positively charged ion of ammonium or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these nutrients, I mean,
this is like a whole quarter chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nutrients are in an ionic form,
cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the root hairs are going through their
exchange process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an active process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an active process and this active
process requires respiration, requires
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And energy is achieved through
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration is the transfer of the sugars
that are created in photosynthesis into
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, therefore using that energy in the
root hair level to carry on this process
[SPEAKER_00]: of cation and anion exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did any of that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of that cation, anion exchange,
you mentioned there's certain basic
[SPEAKER_02]: cations that we talk about with calcium,
magnesium, potassium, sodium and anions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think of nitrogen and phosphorus
being the main two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur, yes, sulfur is a big one because
it allows us to lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of what that comes back to is
pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to spend a lot of time on
pH, but I would like to mention that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think in organics people underestimate the
importance of pH in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about the plant's ability
to uptake nutrients by having a pH in a
[SPEAKER_02]: range that's opposite to what's optimal
for a plant, it just makes it easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant to make these exchanges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's using less energy to receive the
nutrients that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH also impacts the form that the
nutrients are in, in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, plants want to take up
nutrients in a certain form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to take up nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to, they won't take up
nitrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nitrate is NO3, nitrite is NO2,
and they're both an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given too low of a pH, too high of a
pH, these nutrients, although they're
[SPEAKER_00]: present, are not available to the plant
because they're in a form that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can't take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why pH is one major reason why
pH is so important because it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in an available form to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want a box of cereal,
you want to eat some cereal, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it out of the bag and put it into a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in a form you can eat,
as opposed to just eating the box and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic and the cereal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a weird, weird analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about optimal plant
nutrition, all of these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're talking about root hair
death and, you know, water and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: under watering and all of these things all
affecting nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we talk about nutrient
availability from a pH perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all of these things playing
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a simple concept like you
mentioned when you say how plants grow or
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a tendency to think that
presence is the same as availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless we really tune into that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will test their soil,
their lawns, because I deal with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: homeowners, and they'll test it in the
wintertime in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the wintertime, what do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wintertime, we have a lot of
leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they test their soil and it comes
back that nitrates are zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, no wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder my lawn is so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in fact, nitrates are an anion are
moving with the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, in the wintertime,
you're not going to have any nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to you don't want to
apply nitrates in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's just going to move with the
groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you have plenty of nitrates in the
summer if you have organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium because the microorganisms are
converting that ammonium into a nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's so that's why that's why the
pH needs to be really looked into and
[SPEAKER_00]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not only a nutrient present
issue, it's a nutrient availability issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little off topic for this
podcast, but I thought this was really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting in your class when you talked
about fruit trees and when to fertilize
[SPEAKER_02]: and when to prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know a lot of people that listen
this podcast also grow food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you give that quick synopsis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is something I I always
forget and I want to keep it fresh in my
[SPEAKER_02]: head, too, as something that I think is
important because because of you,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I look at a plant now, I don't look
at a raspberry plant and just say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I prune it, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can prune it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start thinking, you know, when does it
when and how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the optimal time for me to prune
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you see the biggest the
biggest mistakes happening with fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's great because, you know,
I was doing a lot of consultation in my
[SPEAKER_00]: heyday and I'd get a ton of questions from
homeowners or from people who were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, when do I prune?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I fertilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I this?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I used to think, man,
I'm getting a lot of these same questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started teaching in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does a plant grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on at certain times of the
of the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're often sold a bill of goods by
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies by chemical companies that are
basically saying it's February time to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk fruit trees,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going through the life cycle of
or of a plant in the wintertime?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't need nutrients in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, March, it's going through a
growth surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it need nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it getting this growth surge?
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth surge is coming from stored
food in the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's stored last fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't need to be fertilizing in
February and in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's just going to be
leaching away in the Northwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the weather is getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to resist that temptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a plant grows, it puts out,
it starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say we've pruned it in February,
March, it starts to grow in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts on this massive amount of shoot
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts on flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those flowers are fertilized by the bees
and other pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts to develop fruit at
that point in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, when that when that fruit
starts to come on, those leaves are fully
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its food reserves are at its lowest ebb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the time to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually tell people around here Memorial
Day, because Memorial Day, the end of May,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when plants are are really needing
some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually we've done it in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Memorial Day, they need those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to to be storing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be they've already exhausted
a ton of energy by producing lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now producing fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit is taking taking products of
photosynthesis to sugars and starches and
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just taking a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I grow a lot of blueberries,
you know, so I fertilize them in May for I
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize in mid May and mid June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm going to be harvesting in
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we move into fall,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in late summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: In late summer, in August, day length is
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients are migrating from the leaves
back to the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not the time to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to, again, I always try
to get people thinking like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be pruned when you're
when you're trying to take those sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: and starches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nutrients and store them in your
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then someone comes along and cuts off 30
percent of your foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and in fact, we've had bad fruit years
when we've had an early frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we've had an early hard freeze,
first of November, when the leaves have
[SPEAKER_00]: not finished migrating sugars back,
that impacts our fruit production for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always getting people to think like a
plant and what is actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will help you answer questions on when to
do things, when to fertilize, when to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you prune a plant in October,
and I was taught this growing up in New
[SPEAKER_00]: England, you don't plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't prune a plant in the fall
because it will send out a lot of new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get frozen off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a crock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant pruned in the fall doesn't
suddenly overcome day length, cool night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, the migration of sugars
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly put out a ton of new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens actually, it may just die or
it may just die back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want growth resurgence, when do I
prune?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prune right before growth resurgence,
which would be February for us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest, because right before growth
resurgence is when I prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get this massive amount of
stored food coming from the root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging new branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get this explosion of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always encouraging people to think
about how plants grow and what's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in their natural cycles with day
length, with night temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what impact will this have?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to rejuvenate a plant,
well, I'm going to prune them in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want a hedge to stay the heights that
I want it to stay at, when am I going to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to prune it in July,
because in July it's already gone through
[SPEAKER_00]: its growth surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its food reserves are at their lowest
ebb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, pruning that hedge in July,
it'll stay nice until next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a client that said, I want you to
prune my hedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I can prune it now and you can pay
me to prune it again in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because if I prune it now,
it's going to have a growth surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks shaggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, let's let it look shaggy till
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll prune it and it will stay nice
for almost a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, that would be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding how plants grow helps you
to be a better practitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that one of the things that you
talked about, too, is different plants
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit differently, for example,
in terms of raspberries fruiting on second
[SPEAKER_02]: year wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you touch on that quickly,
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different plants bear fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a question you ask yourself if
you're trying to say, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask yourself, on what wood does it produce
fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it second year wood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it first year wood?
[SPEAKER_00]: With raspberries, if it's a single crop
raspberry, as opposed to an ever bearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single crop raspberry will produce fruit
on second year wood and then the cane
[SPEAKER_00]: dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cut it down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut that cane down to the ground
because all during the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: while one cane was bearing fruit,
another cane was growing up and living its
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will produce fruit next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people always say, well, how do I know
if I have ever bearing or single crop
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, well, you look at the plant and you
say, well, here's where the fruit was from
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you scratch the bark on that cane
and it comes up green, that means that
[SPEAKER_00]: cane is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means it's an ever bearing
because ever bearing raspberries bear
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit on the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall of the first year and on the
midsection of that same cane the next year
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the cane dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: With raspberries, canes are biennial,
meaning they die after two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the roots are perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a whole topic on raspberries
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we recorded when you came out to the
farm and did a pruning video, we recorded
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still watch that periodically because I
have to refresh myself with the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think like a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When and why do I want to be pruning?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize for this podcast,
a lot of people are focused on cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: production, but they're growing other
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with cannabis, it's good to have
an understanding of why we're pruning the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant the way we are and what's causing
the effects that we're seeing when we do
[SPEAKER_02]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think even in this time of pandemic,
food security is on everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the more we can do to produce
our own food, and part of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding on what wood am I going to
get fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want food security and we all want
to be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to go out in our landscapes
and our gardens, no matter how big or how
[SPEAKER_00]: small they are, and pick an apple and say,
oh, this is pesticide free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't control a lot, but we can
control what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I had an issue growing
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had put a blueberry plant in the ground
and I put some of our biochar soil in with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing just didn't grow for two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to stop and think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized, well, our soil tends
to run a little more alkaline,
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar is alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this blueberry bush growing in
soil that's close to seven, seven one in
[SPEAKER_02]: some cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happy because it's working really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard just to stay alive
because the nutrient availability,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though there was a ton of nutrients
in that biochar soil, it wasn't available
[SPEAKER_02]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes four or five to five,
five pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we weren't even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, especially because it's a
logarithmic scale, just like the Richter
[SPEAKER_02]: scale with earthquakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so far off from what that plant
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I frankly haven't grown a lot of great
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've had good success with raspberries
and other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look forward to learning and
thinking about how a plant grows and what
[SPEAKER_02]: it wants and then trying to structure a
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know if I go back to grow
blueberries now, I'm going to approach it
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely differently and really think
about how do I create that acidic soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: very heavy moisture soil that blueberries
are going to want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what environment do they normally
grow in?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in bogs, which is heavily
moisture, but is also heavily oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore people say around here,
they say, my blueberries won't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got an acid pH in the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's because they're putting them in
heavy clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries don't grow in heavy clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want air at their roots, that air
water relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's air water relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a bog plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this boil down to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to where we started,
which is critical thinking, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you say that, I think of moss
in turf, in grass and lawn around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people say, how do I get rid of my
moss?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll take it out and put in new
sod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moss kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or moss kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet it doesn't really solve their
problem because their problem is
[SPEAKER_02]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's excessive water in that area that
doesn't allow the grass to outcompete the
[SPEAKER_02]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't understand that moss is not
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you see tons of moss in full sun
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because they don't understand
that moss is a function of poor nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: low pH, and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you've got poor nutrition,
low pH, even though it's in full sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a lot of moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we see moss on roofs around here
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's getting light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's that critical thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants, because we've grown up with
plants, because plants are comfortable,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of room for home elixirs,
hearsay, and plants like this and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like this instead of really looking
at the plant and saying, OK, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Becoming discerning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point, because in the
cannabis industry especially, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll talk to someone and they'll
say, you need product X in order to grow a
[SPEAKER_02]: good campus plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this product on and my plants took
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people think they need that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a little bit critical thinking,
you can think, well, that product contains
[SPEAKER_02]: high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person that was growing with it
had a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by adding this product and getting that
nitrogen in there, that was the underlying
[SPEAKER_02]: issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to grow a better plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a soil that has high
nitrogen and you apply this special
[SPEAKER_02]: product, you're not actually helping your
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be making things worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people put in high nitrogen because
they have a lot of bark in their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bark is breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen is helping the microbial
activity break down the bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why that's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that whole scenario is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take somebody else with a different
soil mix and it doesn't work at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great, great comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I could probably keep you on the
phone here chatting all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the interest of your time,
we can sign off here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you established Lake Washington
College, can we give a little plug out for
[SPEAKER_02]: that program?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's such a great program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just give a quick two minutes on
what it is and if people are interested,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they want to take courses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lake Washington Institute of Technology,
which is in Kirkland, Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a great horticulture program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a co-teacher who was with me for
gosh, almost 15 years, is now running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a program that is very strong in the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strong in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to give people a strong
foundation so they can go into cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go into nurseries or retail or
wholesale or growing or whatever they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field of horticulture is so broad and
so vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people need a strong foundation in the
basics because once you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics, then you can branch and become a
professional in a certain specific area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really strong in providing a wide
range of topics that would help you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand soils and botany and
propagation and all those things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can find your niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people think, I don't even like
this part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the next class you take,
you're like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of landscape designers,
landscape practitioners in the field in
[SPEAKER_00]: many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place to really develop skills and
develop the eye of looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you need to be there a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one-year program, certificate or
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you need to be there a year
before you even know what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got 12,000 square feet of growing
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very practical hands-on approach to
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be doing it for a year before
you see some repetition of, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what happens in October and
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I could talk forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great college.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of really caring people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Lake Washington Institute of
Technology in Kirkburn, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ted, for letting me say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would add too that you recently
added a growers program, not specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: listed for cannabis growers, but targeted
towards people that are headed towards
[SPEAKER_02]: that industry and that you've taken out a
few courses that may not be as useful for
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that already has their heart set
on the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, and that was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something I did right before I
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a challenge because the college was
worried about federal funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our president said, I'm very concerned
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to convince her that someone taking
the growers program would also be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer that knowledge into growing of
any type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took out the landscape design part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took out the things that people may not
want that are becoming cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still strong in botany and in
soils and in integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using beneficials and all those things
that are helpful for a cannabis grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've taken out the design part and
some of the other things that are not as
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The college is behind it and the president
was behind it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, she nixed it and I said,
could we talk about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, well, this is my concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, let me expand your view of
this program a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we were done, she said,
wow, I'm so glad you came and talked to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because she was very open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty exciting program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don, I know you're sitting out in your
greenhouse right now in Port Ludlow
[SPEAKER_02]: freezing so we could get good reception
for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reception is good here though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it and I really
enjoyed talking to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed talking to you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to hopefully catching up in
person here in the not too distant future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Don.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
