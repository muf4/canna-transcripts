[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Suzanne Wainwright
Evans.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary focus on biological control and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, nurseries, landscapers,
and interior scape companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the owner of Bug Lady Consulting,
now in business for over 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you missed my first interview with
Suzanne, I highly suggest you start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's episode 15 and will cover much of the
basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne reached out again recently because
she wanted to come back on to clear up
[SPEAKER_01]: some questions regarding the practice of
dipping cuttings, as well as discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: prayer options and the critics of bio
controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder, if you are a large scale
commercial cultivator and are serious
[SPEAKER_01]: about consulting or setting up an IPM
program utilizing beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recommend her enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her website is www.buglady.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a small grower, then I highly
suggest that you try to attend one of her
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming lectures or workshops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about a couple in the show and
I'll have links to them along with other
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a ton of information, including
her upcoming events, articles she's
[SPEAKER_01]: written, and much more on her website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you coming back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned you wanted to come back
on to talk about a few things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't cover in the last podcast and some
general questions you've been getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with dipping with propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little more about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, thanks for having me back and
thanks for the good, solid email questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have gotten, but I definitely did
get a lot of questions about dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think we kind of just brushed
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dipping is not complicated,
but you do have to understand what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing because if not, you can make some
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole idea of dipping and a lot of
this information has come from researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose Boutenhouse is one who's been working
on this a lot for things like poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, since we, the universities
and government researchers really aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: free at this point to work on hemp or
cannabis, what we have to do is we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: look to other research and see how can we
translate that to help us with this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one situation where it started
in poinsettias and mums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the ornamental market,
it has definitely moved through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other varieties of ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely think that in cannabis,
this is really critical because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pests you're getting, most of them are
coming in on cuttings or plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you need to have better sanitation
practices and stop it right at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the same thing that's been
true with poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that when poinsettia cuttings come
in, they've been coming in with things
[SPEAKER_00]: like whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these dip programs have been
developed so you can dip your cuttings in
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution and then stick them so you can
start a lot cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to guarantee you a hundred
percent perfect kill everything all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but it's definitely going to get you
started much cleaner than you would
[SPEAKER_00]: without a dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with what I've been seeing out
on the West Coast with the growers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you really, and almost everybody
has a story of about, well, their grow was
[SPEAKER_00]: clean until somebody brought some plants
or until they brought some cuttings in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a way you can stop that
from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think we might have mentioned a few
products before, and you do have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what state you're in,
you have to see what's approved and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: not allowed and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to speak very general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to think about your situation
and see if this applies to yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But soaps and oils are definitely some of
the leading dips being used in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: another product that's being used quite a
bit is botanogard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when selecting what dip to use,
you have to look at what are your target
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, botanogard and soaps have been
very popular for poinsettias because one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their big issues is whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have seen whitefly in cannabis,
but it's not as big of a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, as like hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot more broad mite I've
seen lately and two spot spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And botanogard is not going to really do
anything for mite issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why there's a lot of interest
looking at a product called SufoilX,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know some of you, if you've talked
to me, we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: SufoilX was actually tested up in Canada
for poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did their dips, it was at a
zero point one percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read the label for a spray for
this particular oil, which by the way is
[SPEAKER_00]: an OMRI listed product, so it is approved
for use in organic production,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spray rate is one percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the research where they were
dipping cuttings in Canada, it was at a
[SPEAKER_00]: zero point one percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that level, they were still able to
get to the insecticidal properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: killing pests, but they didn't get
phytotoxicity from it on the poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they tested mums also.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States right now,
the SufoilX from a federal label does not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dipping on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very, you know, federally,
you technically can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real challenge because we've got to
stop these mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a product we do have some
research on and we have a rate four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't legally tell you anybody to dip
it, but I'm just telling you there's
[SPEAKER_00]: research out there at a zero point one
percent solution that it's shown very good
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticidal properties or let me call
them pesticidal properties at that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Sufoil, we're waiting for the dip
to come for the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not that it's going to be
disallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need it to show up on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has shown to be very effective at
stopping pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the information is out there
online very easily that you can find the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and how they use this zero point
one percent solution to dip in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also done combinations,
again, with like botanogard and a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: point five percent soap solution as a dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from an efficacy standpoint,
we found the Sufoil, I have to say in
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals and cannabis as a foliar spray
product, it has been very, very effective
[SPEAKER_00]: for mite management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to get spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what is critical that a lot of
people will spray and say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's because you didn't get good
spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why if you're doing dips,
you get a hundred percent spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have, you know, a large plant,
whether it be a mum, whether you have it
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whether, you know, it be
anything, getting a hundred percent spray
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage is nearly impossible,
especially when you're using paint
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole nother issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this way you can start clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been very frustrating to me
talking to growers, you know, where like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what's your program?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis people are being too
reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting till they get a pest
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do your dips, let your
plants dry, and then immediately share
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites right out and start on
your program then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing too many suppliers of
biocontrol agents not setting these
[SPEAKER_00]: programs up for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really doing a dysjustice to their
growers there on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is another product I've been
looking at, and it's called Tetra Curb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetra Curb is on the 25B exempt list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is exempt from EPA registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reentry time on it,
no protective equipment, really
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also is proving to be a very
effective miticide for two spot spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're working on testing for
different dip rates, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: dip rates are going to be different than a
spray rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's another product I think
there's a lot of potential with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from being in grows and seeing the
price, people are paying for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: spray products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sufoil is so inexpensive to use in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buy the Sufoil from a traditional
horticultural supply company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's almost twice as expensive on
Amazon if you buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy from companies like
Southern Ag, BFG, Carlin, these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you can get a good price on the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will go a long way for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did have a question about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the Sufoil X, you said was also on
the market under another name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't, the same amount of
ingredient, the oil is last I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and things may change since like
a few days ago, but the Monterey lawn and
[SPEAKER_00]: garden product, which you can buy at a lot
of garden centers in small quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the same highly emulsified oil in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added that to my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot harder to get the Sufoil X in
as a, as a new company to try and offer it
[SPEAKER_01]: to customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I think the, the smallest size was a
couple of gallons or like a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: jug, which is a lot more than a lot of
growers may need that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had a discussion with Bioworks
about packaging size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it might be some smaller
packaging might be coming sooner than
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get in a smaller size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, directly from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying, cause remember a lot of
people I'm dealing with do mix up a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred gallons of spray at the time and
they need these larger quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when it comes to dipping,
you need very small quantities of
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brought up a couple more questions
I wanted to ask you around dipping before
[SPEAKER_01]: we move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of soaps, I think of Dr.
Bronner's, uh, but what kind of soaps do
[SPEAKER_01]: you recommend for, for dipping in and
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Impede.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, and this, you know,
soaps are a whole nother podcast because a
[SPEAKER_00]: soap is not a soap is not a soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different carbon chain links.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, there's some, um,
organic herbicides that are soaps and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just never know, uh, with soap sometimes
what kind of soap is actually in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it gets scary when people start using
detergents, you don't know about what
[SPEAKER_00]: other additives are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impede insecticidal soap is designed to be
an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, it, you know, as with any
insecticide product, you always have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that, you know, you're not going
to have phyto issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use it when your plants
are wilted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray it in the middle
of the day in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all these things that,
you know, you can do to reduce the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: using or having burn from soaps and oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Dr. Bronner thing is,
you know, it, it, I would say it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I know that if you get contact with a
mite, you know, you can, um, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: mortality, you can kill it, but it,
again, it all comes down to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, you know, with a lot of these
products that, it just, it depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: good you spray and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been no real research on
dipping in Dr. Bronner because it's not on
[SPEAKER_00]: the 25 B exempt list, nor is it at a
registered pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, um, it's tough for people to do
research with it because it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, recognized really as a
pesticidal or insecticidal product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have to be just very
buyer, beware using that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is very, as soon as somebody
calls me and says, are you using Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bronner?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a cannabis grower right from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those telltale cannabis
signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying as I saw you a bad
thing, because you know what, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: worry whether a grower do something like
that, then go spray, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or theme or, you know, some of these other
products that can be way nastier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, just, it's, it's a risk
that you can have Fido, um, with that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Dr. Bronner's has a million
different flavors and those innards can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference too, but it's basically
the soap working as a desiccant on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the insects and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get impede again,
you're getting the right carbon chain
[SPEAKER_00]: length as an insecticidal soap without all
this other stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically hear people choosing mint
based Dr. Bronner's ones because they
[SPEAKER_01]: think they'll get some, uh, some of the
qualities of the mint in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticidal properties, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, let me tell you twice this week,
I've been with two mint growers because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't control the insects on their
mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mint's got some great insecticidal
properties going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so a couple other questions I had on
this dipping thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, go ahead and ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've got a list of things to make
sure I tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned mixing botanigard with an
insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you use more than one product at a
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well, that is something that has been
tested and we know it works together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can get yourself into trouble
mixing too many things, um, at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't understand how they're
going to all interact together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one really interesting study on
that is looking at um, nematodes and tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing, uh, well mixing them in a dip with
botanigard because we know botanigard
[SPEAKER_00]: won't kill nematodes, but when they were
doing some research at it, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting nematode mortality and it turned
out what happened is they, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what they think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, as the botanigard settled,
it was pinning the nematodes down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and basically suffocating the
nematodes down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was actually a physical issue of,
of the two products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that you would
definitely have to keep aerated and mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is work, um, from BioWorks
showing, and again, BioWorks does have,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a technical bulletin out on their
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called cleaning up incoming plant
material by utilizing dips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have in there where, um,
you know, they talk about dipping the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, putting the Nemishield
together with the botanigard and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemishield are the nematodes and the rates
and how you can mix them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you're dipping something,
cutting with roots, because I got an email
[SPEAKER_00]: from a grower saying, oh, you said on the
podcast to dip the whole plant and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I, I hope that message didn't
cross because when we talk about oil dips,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about cuttings, you know,
or clones as the cannabis industry calls
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but just the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people get rooted cuttings in,
and we see this much more in ornamentals
[SPEAKER_00]: and even some vegetables, growers are
dipping those young plants with the root
[SPEAKER_00]: media in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the, the, the oasis or whatever media
they're using, but they'll tend to dip
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a botanigard, nematode and root
shield, um, mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those three products we know work very
well together because then you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes into the media, which are going
to kill what's, uh, what's our flower
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, uh, pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also kill fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a botanigard giving a
hundred percent coverage on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get root shield, which is
actually a very good biological fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BioWorks has really good literature on
this telling you how to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to mix the stuff up, um, uh,
with these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the rates for, uh, the dipping with
the soap and the botanigard, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out of a Canadian study,
uh, again, that, uh, Rose Bouton House was
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with, and, you know, they're
wrecking, recommending a 0.5% soap
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they were adding in 125 grams
of per liter of the botanigard,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to mix that together to dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go online and go to,
you know, university government website
[SPEAKER_00]: and look about dip information,
you can find these rates and what's been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and what we know does play well
together in a dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be clear, you're suggesting as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a, if you have a facility,
you should be dipping even off of healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plants, uh, just as part of your,
or your IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is something that everyone should
be doing when they're taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a facility, I would be doing that
because the risk is too great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not talking about a 25 cent
marigold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk is too great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these mites, it's generally just
taking one coming in and, and something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're, you may think your grow
was clean, but if your employee went
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere that had mites and they
hitchhiked, backed back in, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just, it's, you know,
it's very rare that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone says, Oh, I have absolutely no
insect problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no mite problems and my grow at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people start clean and end up
with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a good preventative step
to do because the cost is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labor is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and as of yet, and you know,
things may change as more research comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know, we may find there may be
varietal differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some, some cannabis varieties or
cultivars don't like to be dipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as of yet, I haven't had anybody
contact me and say this was a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: unless they were doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and that's the thing I've found
with some of the emails I got and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting some of the grows that they
weren't dipping correctly because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you want to take your cuttings
or again, your clones, you have your,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and also never take them off
dehydrated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the plants are well watered
before you take your cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you want to mix up whatever
cocktail you're going to dip your cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to make sure it stays well mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if using things like nematodes,
botanigar, that kind of stuff can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: settle out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a lot of cuttings,
um, one of the easiest ways to do it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: take two, like 10, 20 mesh flats,
lay the cuttings in there and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: open parts of the mesh flat facing each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you've made a cage and you
could submerge it down and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold it five to 10 seconds and kind of
shimmy it a little bit in there until no
[SPEAKER_00]: air bubbles come up because that means
that once the air bubbles stop coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no air left touching the
products down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean on the cuttings because if there's
an air pocket that means part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's not getting covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis people aren't going to be
doing that volume of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people do is they basically will
just mix up maybe one gallon of solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: put on your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and depending again, what you're
using, you might need different protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, but basically taking a hand
full of the cuttings and then submerging
[SPEAKER_00]: them and just kind of shaking them,
not violently, but shaking them underwater
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you know, 10 seconds or so until no
air bubbles come up, pull it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, drip it off a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you can either some people,
you know, will lay them out, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, you know, keep them cool to the
next day or, you know, get them stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: right then, um, on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I'm seeing and,
and believe me, ornamental guys made this
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake at, um, first, but now I'm a
little concerned because some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis guys are, don't use that dip
solution day after day after day,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you do have a risk of diseases
getting in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, between cultivars or
between, you know, different groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you might want to change that
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't hold it over and use it again
and again, because you will spread
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and especially if you're using
something like botanical, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, nematodes, they'll all be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll end up drowning in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so just mix up what you need and use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the question is, is what do you
do with that leftover product after you
[SPEAKER_00]: dipped your cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not spray it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no, no, don't spray it in
your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to dispose of it however your
state, you know, allows you to dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I know some of my ornamental guys do
is they go and they spray it around
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, around their greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just dispose of it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously with something like Dr.
Bronner's, which again, I have no idea on
[SPEAKER_00]: a dip rate for that, that isn't a
registered pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's easier to dispose of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you don't want to take,
you know, a product that you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: washed all these bad things off your
cuttings and go apply it right to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of really good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sharing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can visualize the dipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that really helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try and put up some photos if I
can find some to, to help listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioworks has some, and like I said,
you know, I teach these workshops all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place and Debbie from Bioworks,
I have pulled her with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's what she and I are going
to be up in Alberta teaching some classes
[SPEAKER_00]: in, uh, I think it's two weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one day we're doing ornamentals,
one day we're doing vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I call her dipping Debbie because she
does a really good demonstration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you mix up root shield,
what should it look like in the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix up a tana guard, what should
it look like in the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure, you know, you get it all mixed
in because some of those powdered products
[SPEAKER_00]: can clump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know like seeing this is where
you've got to know your state because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't use the powdered, you can't use the
wetable powder in Oregon of the tana
[SPEAKER_00]: guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta, you know, know what your
state rules are and use the right
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using a powder, powdered
formulation, those clumps are easy to sink
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bottom and you got to get them and
she'll use like a whisk, um, to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it gets all mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she does a really, really amazing
demonstration on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, the Vineland research and
innovation stage center, um, where again,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose Bouton House, uh, works, they've been
putting together some videos on dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: again, a little more poinsettia oriented,
but it definitely will help provide good
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because again, I mean, I mean,
I've, you know, I was out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that a week and a half ago,
two weeks ago, some of you people
[SPEAKER_00]: listening probably saw me come by your
facility, but it just, I feel so bad for
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys because you're just not getting
good solid science information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and you've got to have this stuff
in order to stay in business these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into that a little bit,
but before we do, we had talked a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't give any actual recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you love the company DRAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-R-A-M-M.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any particular sprayers that
you recommend for getting good coverage?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't like paint sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because paint sprayers aren't
pesticide sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I am not a, I'm not a spray
equipment expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I have my niche of,
you know, how, how to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know, uh, I, what I tell
my growers to do is contact Graham,
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham, DRAM and say, you know,
I'm an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, we mix up this much product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, and have them tell you
what the right equipment is for you
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know their equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's what's what they're experts
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I am a firm believer of no
one is an expert on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've seen me in person,
you know, unfortunately I'm an eye roller
[SPEAKER_00]: because like, when I meet somebody and I'm
like, well, what do you specialize in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I specialize in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's an expert in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have to do is find the expert
in the field you need to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or again, you know, like you can talk to
one expert and they'll say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but this is the person to go
talk to, you know, that, and that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built this network of other experts
because I don't know everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think DRAM has good solid equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of what my ornamental guys use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not knocking any other spray company
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, um, I've just always had,
um, very, I've heard very good things
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see my customers are happy and they're
innovative, um, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: later about their nematode bucket,
which unfortunately I didn't realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry didn't know about
the nematode bucket, but we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't we cover it now since you
brought it up and we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had an experience at the last
conference you were at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where someone was talking about having
trouble getting even distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes in greenhouse applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said the solution was out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to cover that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's an amazingly simple
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the, I would call it the
sophisticated way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DRAM has made, um, because we were
years ago having problems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental market, keeping our nematodes
suspended in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you make your stock solution of
nematodes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you don't have aeration to
keep oxygen in the water and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the water moving, the nematodes sink
out and you don't get even distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had discussions years ago with
DRAM and other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing my growers have done that
the, the, this is the unsophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just literally can use a fish bubbler
that you can get from a bait store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like, instead of,
you know, having your, your bait well for
[SPEAKER_00]: your little fish with your bubbler in it,
you just drop that bubbler into your
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of stock nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be very careful your
bubbler and that what you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people have tried different
things, doesn't get warm because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cook your nematodes and it's easy
to cook your nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea again, is to keep oxygen in the
water because think of nematodes like fish
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to keep them moving in the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a fish bubbler can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what DRAM developed, and I know,
sorry DRAM, it's a little pricey,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it's on my, it's an idiot proof
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes, you know,
you're going to pay a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's done and you don't have to worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bucket that can, you can plug it in
or it can run off battery and it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: your nematodes in suspension, in
suspension and aerate some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my ornamental guys do is they'll
take those buckets and then you just stick
[SPEAKER_00]: a dosatron in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can use that to evenly dose
out your nematodes per pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting an even distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautifully simple answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you can use that bucket for
other things you want to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you can use a dosatron for a
lot of different things to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: better, even distribution in your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dosatron and BASF, and BASF is the
world's largest producer of nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: do have literature out there telling you
how to use a dosatron with the beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you do have to remove a filter
out of it, but it's actually very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if some of you have been to
some of my workshops, we actually did a
[SPEAKER_00]: live demonstration of this out in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was about two years ago at the
Plug and Cutting Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to be doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, for those of you that are coming to
the Cultivate Show, which is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now for the ornamental guys,
ornamental slash hint of veg, vegetable in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest greenhouse show we have
in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in July in Columbus, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think maybe 30 bucks to get
in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think education's maybe $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really inexpensive show,
but it brings about 10,000 greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Saturday before, I have put
together a workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the morning, it is going to be insect
ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn those five or six aphids
you need to know, we're going to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn the few common thrips
we're going to teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the afternoon, we're going to go
out to a commercial greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've set up with myself and then some
of, I will call them my A-Team biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: producing companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're specific people in
their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have handpicked who I've asked to help
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to unpack biocontrol
agents and show you how to apply them
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do everything from
wasps to mites to nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to come learn how to do it
firsthand, we're going to be doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, well, you know,
I'm teaching in a couple weeks at the bio,
[SPEAKER_00]: bio pesticide biocontrol conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that specific biocontrol for
cannabis producers, but that we're limited
[SPEAKER_00]: to being inside the hotel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, hotels don't get really
excited when you start applying bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: around on things in hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to be able to do live
demonstrations there, which by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that has already sold out
possibly because the conference contacted
[SPEAKER_00]: me and asked if they could add more
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was trying to keep it to a limited
size, but they said there's been just so
[SPEAKER_00]: much demand that we might be expanding the
size of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't gotten registered,
you better register now or get on the wait
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be at that meeting and a
tad, you're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I signed up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also signed up for the greenhouse tour
field tour the day before the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most likely it gets that sold out
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like, cause they're,
they want me to go on that to help with
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably going to be in a chase car
going around with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see you on, on Wednesday too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, for these applications that,
you know, it's one thing to sit here and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing to see it being done
right in front of you where you can ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and touch the equipment and have
the experts in their fields do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that is, you know,
going to be super helpful that show in
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not, it doesn't break the
bank to attend that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, last year we did another
workshop and actually there were cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: people that came because again,
there is a lot of crossover between
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and ornamentals, just like this
nematode bucket here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ornamental and vegetable guys,
we've had the answer to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just somehow the information
didn't flow over into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now here you go, cannabis guys,
here, here's your easy solution to doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the, the dram nematode bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they've got videos and
information right on their website or use
[SPEAKER_00]: a fish bubbler and with a dosatron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with that fish bubbler, are you
putting an air stone or anything on the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just putting a line directly and
it's just bubbling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it depends on what size people are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we've done some tests with
some of my growers, but if, if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aerate it where the hose is,
if you're in a round bucket shooting,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it kind of makes a toilet flushing
whirl because you, again, you want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everything kind of mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another girl of mine made like a
bigger, a bigger one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like a sprinkler head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pushing the nematodes up and
they're coming down the sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did find some of the nematodes were
getting trapped in the corners there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why dram, you know,
I didn't realize, cause again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, we are waiting for this
bucket for a while and it was because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a lot harder to engineer than they
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it depends on the, again,
back to the shape of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got to keep them moving and you
don't get them trapped in corners,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also want to aerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at what you're, you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, as long as you're getting
them out in a reasonable amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just, you don't want to let the
nematodes sit for hours in that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you want to get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will warn you, I had one, uh,
greenhouse operation to run their
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tapped into the airlines for their,
I guess, pneumatic greenhouse tables,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, the, they use the,
the, they step on a pedal and it lifts the
[SPEAKER_00]: table up, but there were oil in those
lines and then oil got in their nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds crazy, but you got to have a
clean air source and you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what dram said was the other
engineering, uh, challenge is because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you compress air, it can create heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their early designs, the bucket
actually heated up and it would cook the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to engineer a way to keep the
nematodes moving and oxygenated without
[SPEAKER_00]: getting warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is chlorine or chloramines an issue
when you're using nematodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it can affect the microbial content
and compost teas when I look under the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, but are you seeing anything
with nematodes is a big deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your average tap water drinking
water is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if, if, if something does kill
nematodes, then it would probably being
[SPEAKER_00]: used as a nematocyte out in the farm
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that you mentioned
was that information's not making it over
[SPEAKER_01]: from say the ornamental industry or the
horticulture industry over into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that relates to, I would say
the, the consultants that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you and I talked off air about
that a little bit, um, in terms of pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: and the economic dynamics of the pest
management that you're seeing on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to touch on any of those
topics real quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I don't know, maybe I'm snob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I consider if someone is
a consultant, they just consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how you can consult on
your own product you're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I consider if you are,
have a product for sale and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing information, then your,
your technical support for that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: because to me consultant means unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I've worked very hard with
my business is I'm not financially
[SPEAKER_00]: connected, you know, to, I don't get paid
by the chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get paid by the insectaries to,
to, to promote their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, if I recommend a product,
I never, never take any kind of kickbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been tempting at times because
people have offered me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey, we got this huge sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us give you a commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, I can't take it because
that kind of, ruins my neutrality that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked so hard to build over all
these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when, when somebody says
they're a consultant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, you know, find out, well,
do you sell anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I say always to ask
is, is what, you know, what is your
[SPEAKER_00]: background to, to be giving me advice,
even as a technical support person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here to advise me on, on insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what's your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: How have you been doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing right now with the cannabis
industry is because there has been so much
[SPEAKER_00]: money in it from the sense of people
selling product to cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have found that I'm seeing this as
nice as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make money selling products and
not know anything about your products is
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest thing I've learned in the last
few years, because there's such a demand
[SPEAKER_00]: for products and such demand for people
that are willing to be able to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry because,
you know, the university people can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: the government people can't, and,
you know, there still is some stigma out
[SPEAKER_00]: there with some companies where,
you know, they don't want to be associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the pool of people,
the cannabis industry can pull from to get
[SPEAKER_00]: help is smaller than if you're a corn
farmer or if you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mum grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, you've got to be able to
vet what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first thing is, is just because you
say it with confidence doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been, you know, and I
literally had a grower that was buying
[SPEAKER_00]: product from a company and the
recommendations, I just did not understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommendations at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the complete wrong predatory might
for the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked the grower, I'm like,
well, why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because the supplier told me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, did you ask him?
[SPEAKER_00]: And question him, why are you telling me
to use this might?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, well, no, because he said
it with such confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so sure the way he said things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just believed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say, you know,
you have to be skeptical and not trust
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody, but the cannabis people just need
to do some better vetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to do because, you know,
I was at a meeting where I met you and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a lot of talks on
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying anybody said anything
about lighting was wrong or bad because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what, I don't know enough about
lighting to even know if what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me was true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was sitting there, that's what I
was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying, you know, this is the
best to do here and use this here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how do I know they're true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're standing up on a stage and
saying things, but how do we know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very hard to be able to vet a
subject that you're not educated on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only vet really, you know,
people that I can vet what's being said
[SPEAKER_00]: about subject areas I know about,
but like lighting is not one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I can't tell you if it's
true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how as a grower do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about that, how from the
outside looking in, it's almost impossible
[SPEAKER_01]: to know if the information you're getting
is good or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you, if you were a grower,
go about vetting, go about vetting a
[SPEAKER_01]: potential consultant when it comes to
insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have like my list of questions that I
will tell to my growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, ask these questions and see what
kind of answers you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain things like that,
that are just sure telltale signs that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be to, you know, knowing about
lighting on insects and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who needs light, who doesn't need light,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is too, if, you know,
you have an insect problem, or let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got broad mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come in and I said, okay,
you know, let's use Cucumeris.
[SPEAKER_00]: You as a grower should say to me,
okay, Suzanne, why are you telling me to
[SPEAKER_00]: use Cucumeris?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just say, well, because it's the
best, not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the right answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to discuss temperatures,
what are the crops we've done this in and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of, anybody on here listening,
or one of the people that I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: your groves, you know, I, and it's almost
too much, I'm going to overload you with
[SPEAKER_00]: information because I want to give you all
the facts and all my years of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing this to be like, this is,
you know, what we're, what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: why we're making these decisions because
there are situations in cannabis and I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dealing with this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pest, we may not know how to
treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say, we don't know and
let's try this, but here's our contingency
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody that comes in is just like,
well, I'm going to solve all your problems
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight, just buy all these bugs for me
and dump them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be very careful on that,
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to, I don't want to give
you away my like telltale questions
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily, because I know that some of
the, the people that sell bios are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get, then they're going to be
able to hear the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's just such a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, one of the other, you can always
contact me, believe me, I get emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm struggling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I do get between like 40 to 60
emails a day right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm struggling to keep my head above
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you just say,
Hey Suzanne, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a smaller girl or something and you
know, you don't necessarily need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't, I'm not looking for people to
hire me, but if you just are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's somebody good to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just be like, go talk to this
person, go talk to that person,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't handle, I can't work with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people that they don't need me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of the problem solver when
everything's gone to crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come in and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the situation or, you know,
do training to like teach you,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you recognize the problems early?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you set up, you know, better SOPs
for, you know, your, your workflow on pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management in your greenhouse,
but just as far as, you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have problems really, but I want
to get started with bios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can definitely point you in
the right direction and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: depend where you are in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your key pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is not, I'm not always going
to tell everybody to go to one supplier
[SPEAKER_00]: for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it all depends on those
different variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no reason growers can't do
their own research and track data and use
[SPEAKER_01]: the scientific method to figure out what
works in their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, consultants can point you in the
right direction, but you can still learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that I'm seeing with,
as you brought it up, the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: method, cannabis people are not doing
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I keep telling people
that are buying these six, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: $800 spray products that there's like,
you know, $5 worth of product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle, you know, spray your plants with
that triple wrench or sprayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then spray a couple of plants would
just water the exact same way and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the same results because cannabis
growers can get much better spray coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have a much, you have a lot
fewer plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my background is coming from,
you know, where someone has to go spray 10
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of plants and they're not going to
get good spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, you know, they're using,
you know, they have these like systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: and trans laminar pesticides and things
like that because they can't get as good a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray coverage with the soaps and oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, you should be able to get
really, really, really good spray
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get, they have what are called
water sensitive cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these yellow cards and they look
like sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a side note, sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go into another cannabis grow that
does not have sticky cards, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: poke somebody in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to use sticky cards,
but let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go back to my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cards look like yellow sticky
cards, but once they get water or moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: on them, they turn blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what my ornamental people will do
is they will basically kind of hide these
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the crops and then have somebody
come through and spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can come back and look and
see what kind of spray coverage you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those cards are still yellow,
then that means that area got no product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there is, you know,
something to just washing your plants off
[SPEAKER_00]: with water for things like spider mite
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's just that physical
knocking off the plant, it also raises the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and spider mites don't
necessarily like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm suspect about some of these
products, these mega expensive products
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're putting out that I think that
possibly water is doing a lot of the
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've tested a lot of these
products in the ornamental market and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't get the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having been in the cannabis industry for a
few years now, it's made me a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: skeptic in terms of products and marketing
claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing I do when I'm
evaluating a product is I want to see all
[SPEAKER_01]: the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know that they're willing to
list all the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moment I hear the word
proprietary, a lot of red flags come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing I look for is,
is this product being used in horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the ornamental industry,
somewhere outside of cannabis or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing it strictly to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it really worked all that well
and had all this efficacy, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer or a pesticide, it wouldn't
just be in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people really need to do the research
because they're spending way too much
[SPEAKER_01]: money on these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that were at the
organic meeting where I spoke in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess two or three weekends ago,
you know, the one thing I talked about a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot was poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poinsettias make so little money off
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have a few cent profit
margins on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if a product is being used in
poinsettias, you know, it has to work
[SPEAKER_00]: because a grower, like if I go to a
poinsettia grower and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to spend five cents more a
plant, they are going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the door because they can't afford
to put a five more cents of input into
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something that is used in
poinsettia production, actually used,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it works because the poinsettia
guys can't afford to use it unless it does
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot of product testing in
poinsettias because again, the product
[SPEAKER_00]: profit margin is so slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember if I mentioned this
before, but one of my greenhouse growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, ornamental ones, we did order
in for entertainment purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a bunch of these cannabis
products that are, you know, on the 25B
[SPEAKER_00]: exempt list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to have EPA
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested them and we just,
we either burned the plants up or we just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get any kind of control with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, like, I think stuff oil is a
good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, you know, keep going back to
that, you know, I mean, it's not that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, again, this is not a commercial
for stuff oil, but just looking at costs
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can get a jug of stuff oil,
I think from the horse supply companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's maybe 60, $70 for a large jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Amazon, I think they want like 120
where I'm seeing products that have half
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're being sold for six or 700,
which don't have the efficacy or safety
[SPEAKER_00]: track record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also these plant botanicals,
we don't know how they impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a solid history with using stuff
oil X with predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get into plant extracts,
as we talked about, some of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts have repelling qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know neem is a repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't seem to work well enough to repel
all your pests away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some research showing,
you know, where they spray leaves with
[SPEAKER_00]: neem, they spray leaves with azadirachtin,
they put predatory mites on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like, nope, we're not going
to stay as compared to untreated leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: they will stay on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the period with stuff oil X
of when you can start reintroducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, stuff oil, once it's dry,
we'll spray on a Monday, we're releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: on Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the tetracurb, I just had a
conversation with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're after their miticide
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying they just feel comfortable
as a general rule two days is what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they're being very general
because, well, are we releasing Cucumeris
[SPEAKER_00]: or releasing Swirsky or releasing
Persimilis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you get into more specific
chemistries, I think fluoramide is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good example, even though legal
cannabis, you know, they're not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fluoramide has always been very touted
as very safe with beneficials and
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because it's very safe
with using Persimilis and Cucumeris,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can be very toxic to Swirsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get into some of these other
chemistries, you have to specifically look
[SPEAKER_00]: into, you know, the specific, you can't
just paint with a broad brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as a product says to me,
we kill pests, but we're safe with
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials, I call BS on that product
because whether something is a pest or a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial is all subjective to who you
are and what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products are not sentient and can't
make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another telltale on products
for me is how they are marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what their claims are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the 25B products, technically
they're supposed to not make false claims,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not really getting policed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen crazy claims of products
being systemic when they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually it will probably catch up
with them because again, with the 25B,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can list whatever
insecticide you want, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to lie on those labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the government does come a knock
and you better have proof of your claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, eventually they're going to
start cracking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned, I would just throw that
that also includes plant washes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are listing things as plant washes
and then telling you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: off label that they're insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something else to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they've proven you don't
know what's in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also mentioned that phytotoxicity
is not always something you can visually
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these botanicals may have an
impact or be stressing the plant and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might not even realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they did that the most,
I think the most textbook study that was
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, when they were using the
ivory soap on tomatoes where they got
[SPEAKER_00]: lower yield using ivory soap and compared
to an insecticidal soap, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see phytotoxicity on the plant,
it definitely affected the yield on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to circle back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little about other consultants
out there and some of the recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: you were hearing that you weren't very
excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things you had mentioned,
sorry, off air was that consultants were
[SPEAKER_01]: not recommending treatment and propagation
or early in the plant's life when there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much less leaf tissue and it's easier
to, you know, easier to do lower rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, this is what makes me think that
they don't know what they're doing or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just trying to make more money off
off the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody deserves to be in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody deserves to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not trying to take a living away from
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, when you have to do pest
management and propagation, you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: wait because if you wait, you may not be
able to treat the problem or it may be too
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive to treat for the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can get very expensive to try to be
curative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure a lot of people are going to
be shaking their heads because they look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the money they've spent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these recommendations I've
heard, if just the person that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is what we're going to do for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have told you from the beginning
it wasn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, I don't know everything in
some situations and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know, but there's some things we
know just aren't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be, you know, talk to more
than one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell all my growers work with at least
two different insectaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you have, you know, you have more
than one person to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Kelly Vance with Beneficial
Insectary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he does a great job, but I
guarantee you he will not be offended at
[SPEAKER_00]: all if, you know, you turn around and you
go ask, you know, like Paul Cool from
[SPEAKER_00]: BioBest, you know, hey, we've got this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people like Kelly and Paul
will kind of be glad that the grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking initiative to do your homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll often find is that with
these people that I think have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a very good job, you'll get very similar
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you always have to do the exact
same thing to get the same answer because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have spider mites and there's
possible different routes to take to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that with these good
solid pest management people get upset
[SPEAKER_00]: when you question their recommendations
because again, it makes me feel good when
[SPEAKER_00]: you question me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does because that means you care and
you're taking the time to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to be very careful with
these recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody's working with you and if
they have not put together a program for
[SPEAKER_00]: your propagation or, and you know,
they've been just focusing on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, releasing at the end of the
crop, I would say find somebody else to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to start and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and again, I hate even
going back to ornamentals, but like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals, we're sticking our cuttings
and we're getting the beneficials right
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get nematodes, you know,
right as soon as they're stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, air quotes here because
you've got to look at your media and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those kinds of things and how
you're propagating because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work in all systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're rooting in soil,
you should be putting nematodes right in
[SPEAKER_00]: from the get-go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just standard, that's
standard inexpensive practice because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stop the fungus gnats,
then I'm not going to get the call when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out in your grow with a mascara
brush trying to brush, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats out of your blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the last thing I want to touch
on on this subject is pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said you've seen some pretty
dramatic price increases for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers over other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say it's a price increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will just say that the cannabis people
are paying way more than the ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: markets are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say this very delicately as
possible without everybody hating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure I'm going to get some nasty
emails, but it's typically through the
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors I'm seeing some pretty
exorbitant pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do understand, you know,
that if they're calling on you,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a good service, they're
educating you, you know, you do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for some of that in your pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, if you pay five
percent and I'm just making that number up
[SPEAKER_00]: ten percent more, but you're getting good
customer service, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I have no problem for I
mean, I don't think that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I take issue with is I'm seeing
as much as, you know, a hundred percent if
[SPEAKER_00]: not more price increases and they're just
not even getting good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the bottom line is people need to do
their own research as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to you need to look shop around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find out who knows what
they're talking about and double check
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're telling you with someone
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that just puts the onus on the
grower is all it really comes down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and the thing is, is it may
seem like a huge hump at first,
[SPEAKER_00]: but once you get over this hump and you
learn these basics, then it gets easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, I don't think my job gets easier
every year, but because I always have new
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you once you've experienced
a problem and been able to get through it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then you know for the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does get easier as for a grower
when you're dealing in a mono cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with the information,
I mean, I really feel like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is hijacked to the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be very, very, very careful and
selective about what you read online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, years ago, I had to stop
trying to answer all these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like I even struggle with
some of the the groups, the message
[SPEAKER_00]: boards, because I just I get mad because I
see what growers are being told to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or someone puts up a picture of an aphid
and someone's like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a winged, you know, fungus gnats
because but they say it so assertively
[SPEAKER_00]: like they know and it's not accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just really have to you have to
educate yourself and you have to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: good sources to get educated so that you
are more knowledgeable and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard growers paying a
dollar a sachet, you know, for the release
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and, you know, ornamental guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's differences in pricing
between biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it Cucumeras in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Swirsky in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Andersonian there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you need five sachets,
you know, you're probably going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay more than my grower getting 10000
sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the the sachets with like
Cucumeras, you know, they can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, ornamental people are paying
maybe 15 cents for those, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to hear people paying, you know,
these exorbitant prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, everybody deserves to make a
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the distributors do need to
have a bit of a markup for their business,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the service they're supplying and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it better come with some really,
really, really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some amazing customer service if
you're getting those kinds of markups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's been any secret for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really push my growers to,
you know, buy a bit more direct from the
[SPEAKER_00]: insectaries in the sense of having the
product drop ship direct to the insectary
[SPEAKER_00]: direct to you from the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you got three plants at your house,
you're not going to be able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volumes are going to be too large.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging is going to be too large for
you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insectaries are really set up to be
sold to commercial growing operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something I want to touch on again
that you mentioned that I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: important that we've kind of glossed over
is once you have an IPM program in place
[SPEAKER_01]: and once you have the right procedures in
place with the dipping and the scouting
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have the right staff there,
it becomes very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like at that point that you're
putting in all this time and energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: money into biocontrols.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really runs itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want people to get discouraged,
like you mentioned, because I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: it is very possible and you're working
with people that are doing it already and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this idea that biocontrol
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when do I get a phone call when they
have sprayed and tried everything and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want me to come, you know, sometimes fix
the problem because they can't get it
[SPEAKER_00]: under control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true across, you know,
all crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing with the cannabis,
again, if you start early that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, but imagine cannabis growers
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to grow, you know, 200
varieties of plants and you perpetually
[SPEAKER_00]: had new cuttings coming in the door from
other countries and from other growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: you had this perpetual train of pests
coming in and how hard that is to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why not all, but a lot of the
ornamental people have definitely shifted
[SPEAKER_00]: into using the biocontrols, especially in
propagation, because they're able to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems there before they get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they're not spraying pesticides
there that can create resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you rotate pesticides through
motives of actions, you can still develop
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you get spider mites
in your greenhouse, you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily their pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had come, you know, from an
ornamental crop where they've had exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over to different chemistries,
you know, some of your chemistry may not
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know the pedigree of the pest
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if some of, I will say,
the synthetic pesticides will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we go back to the soaps and
oils, because they're more of a physical
[SPEAKER_00]: kill and they really don't care as much
about, you know, what genetics you have
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a bug lady consulting t-shirt
that says you can't build resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: being eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with some of these
pests, we're dealing with a lot of white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies, spider mites and aphids that are
resistant to a lot of chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, when that lasermin comes
and chows down on you or that parasite
[SPEAKER_00]: comes and sticks her egg in you,
she doesn't really care that much if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're resistant to, you know,
orithine or avid kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why there's been this real
growth too with the biocontrols,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because of we don't have to worry about
resistance issues that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even so far with a lot of the
microbial products, we haven't had any
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance issues to like Bavaria bossiana
or trichoderma or things of those nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with a lot of the beneficials,
you know, some of them are limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they are going to search
high and low on that plant to find a food
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the chemicals you are using in
cannabis, well, they're not systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can't use the systemic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using contact products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you get 100% spray coverage,
you're not going to be able to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big things that came up
that we discussed at the meeting in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland a couple of weeks ago,
there's no such thing really as a systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: miticide out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's saying they have a systemic
miticide, again, move on down the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll probably get into
that more at the biocontrol cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: conference in California, but it just
doesn't really exist because of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemicals move in the plants and plant
biology and physiology and the way insects
[SPEAKER_00]: and mites feed differently in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole other discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really when you have critics that are
saying the biocontrols don't work,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really want to focus on some of the
variables associated with both the
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, like the sprayer that you're
using, the consulting advice and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, even if you're applying the right
bugs to deal with the right situation in a
[SPEAKER_01]: given environment, or even the quality of
the insects that people are purchasing to
[SPEAKER_01]: know that they're alive and fresh and
arriving in an in a condition where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to want to eat whatever the
pest is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of variables that
people need to consider before they jump
[SPEAKER_01]: to biocontrols don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I think that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what cracks me up to no end is,
and again, this is across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental, vegetable, cannabis,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: People spray a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They spray it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll still spray it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, one little hiccup in a
biocontrol program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, biocontrol doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not the fact of and the top reasons I
will say now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's changed through the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were doing this podcast,
let's say, 20 years ago, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually selling biocontrol
agents 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first one of most issue would be,
you know, we really didn't know a lot what
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing and we're having to do a lot
of trialing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expected failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also product quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't as good today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm seeing people failing
honest to God is I think the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say cannabis and I will even
include ornamentals in this is bad advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I mean, it's just some of the basic
simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a greenhouse that runs at 60
degrees and they were putting out Swirsky
[SPEAKER_00]: for control of Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky does not like to be at 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need little tiny mittens for the
Swirsky and scarves for them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is where I'm like,
why is this person even making this
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: They should know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right there, that program was
failing solely because it was a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from the again, product quality
standpoint and periodically I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these product quality workshops
on how to assess your biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gotten way, way, way,
way better on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as long as the products come
to you from the insectaries and the key,
[SPEAKER_00]: the key players as far as insectaries,
where are the bugs coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have BioLine, you have Biobest,
you have Colpert, you have Beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: Insectary and also BASF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now BASF just does the nematodes so that
they're only a nematode producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other four companies,
those are, I would say, the the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: producer and like Colpert's probably
largest in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biobest is probably behind them and
BioLine might be right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where, if they're right
behind Biobest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the big insectaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of them have production overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you go look at a map,
you know, there's production in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico and different locations in Europe
and Spain and Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have multiple insectaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the product we're getting
here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: does come from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's FedExed over and then so it comes
from Europe over to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes to the insectary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're buying from an
insectary, it comes to you from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to a distributor that
distributes it physically themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it gets shipped to the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where things, you know,
how long is it at the distributor for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've gotten emails before from
companies, distributors that have over
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like we're sitting on all this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of anybody that wants to buy
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's another day the product's
been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some things can handle that,
but other biocontrol agents don't do so
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like persimilis, man, you want
that out of the bottle the second you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been research done on how they can
cannibalize themselves in packaging the
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really you need to know your
sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do go to buy from a distributor,
whose product am I getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting Biolines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting Biobest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are different packagings,
there's different carriers, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: different differences between the company
and different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when I talk to people that
are buying through distributors,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, whose product are you
getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, you get familiar with the
way packaging is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, again, familiar with carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a good example is if you look at
aphid parasites, you get it from Bioline.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no carrier in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it from Biobest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got buckwheat hull in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it from Copert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like a sawdust carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do have to do different release
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those products, Beneficial Insectary
doesn't use a carrier in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to have carrier one
week and not a next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person going to put them out gets
confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these are all things that
have to be looked at when trying to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: program work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes people are getting
products that are a little old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually on some of the
microbials, I've had growers buy products
[SPEAKER_00]: that were expired through distributors
that are holding the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to, you know, you got to watch
all that stuff and be aware of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other reason I do see
biocontrol programs fails is pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's something on the plants that
we didn't know about or that was sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is incompatible with a biocontrol
agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another reason we can have issues
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I covered or we covered all
the topics that I wanted to cover today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else you wanted to chat
about before we sign off for listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, again, I'll say it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: People deserve to be in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just I think for the
cannabis industry, people need to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: better job getting information to the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a cannabis grower, you need to just,
you know, put on your thinking cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: as my mom used to tell me to do all the
time and, you know, analyze what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: being told.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone is telling you to dissolve aspirin
in water and water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that really make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about some of these
things growers are being told to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to the root aphid issue,
which, you know, I got some emails about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing work looking at nematodes on
root aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say we had the solution for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still right now, my strong strongest
recommendation is still using botanogard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you got to apply the botanogard
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't just, you know,
magically spritz it on the soil surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and expect your root aphids to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's differences between
the soils, a volume of pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variables in it,
but I just don't feel comfortable enough
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending nematodes, rove beetles,
or even, you know, hypoaspis myels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is now strilolapsis, as a control
option for root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may help suppress it, but I've talked
to people that have spent thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars on those three previously
mentioned biocontrol agents and not gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: control of root aphids or even suppression
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful about the information you're
getting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when someone makes a recommendation,
you know, does it suppress it or does it
[SPEAKER_00]: control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was entomologist Suzanne Wainwright
Evans, also known as the Bug Lady.
