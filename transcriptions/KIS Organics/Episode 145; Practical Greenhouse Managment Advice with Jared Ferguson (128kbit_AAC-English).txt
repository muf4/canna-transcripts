[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before starting the podcast, I wanted to
share about an exciting new conference
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are hosting in conjunction with
Collective Elevation in Bozeman,
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to Suzanne Wainwright
Evans, the Bug Lady, about hosting a
[SPEAKER_01]: conference for years, and Adam at
Collective graciously offered to open up
[SPEAKER_01]: his doors and let us host it on his
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event is happening September 5th
through the 7th, 2025, and I'm super
[SPEAKER_01]: excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are kicking it off with workshops from
the Bug Lady Suzanne and Dr. Nadia Saba,
[SPEAKER_01]: also known as Dr. Greenhouse, followed by
a facility tour and then a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent speakers and networking events
over the next three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the 7th, the Montana Living Soil
Alliance is hosting a tasting event that
[SPEAKER_01]: will be included in the price of the
conference ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tasting event will be a private event
with cannabis donated by the Living Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: Alliance as a way to have an amazing
sensory experience and see what premium
[SPEAKER_01]: quality Montana Living Soil has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickets are limited to 200 spots,
so be sure to grab a ticket if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tickets are now on sale at KISOrganics
.com and the conference is called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cultivation and Science
Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In honor of the conference, I wanted to do
an interview series with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing folks at Collective Elevation to
give a grower's perspective and share some
[SPEAKER_01]: of what they've been able to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already had Adam Arnold on the
podcast, and you can also view a tour of
[SPEAKER_01]: their facility at the KIS Organics YouTube
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Jared Ferguson,
the Greenhouse Manager at Collective
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been at Collective for over four
years now, but prior to that he studied
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental horticulture at Montana
State University in Bozeman, during which
[SPEAKER_01]: he worked for the university's greenhouse
facility and research farm, where he got
[SPEAKER_01]: his first experiences in mixing soil,
amending plants, managing irrigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and conducting IPM processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared, thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you've been with Collective
Elevation for a little while now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you are the fertility manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your exact title?
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse Manager is what I've been going
with, and no one's told me no,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I've been going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do the fertility management and
kind of the irrigation management,
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically just taking care of the
greenhouses once we got plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: through their veg cycle and flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and as you know, irrigation and
fertility are tied very closely together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just tell me a little bit about
your experiences and what you've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: since starting here at Collective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came from the academic background,
so I went to school at Montana State
[SPEAKER_00]: University, got a horticulture degree
there, and kind of the biggest thing from
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning from that over to here was
just kind of figuring out how to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: big picture ideas of soil fertility and
doing your soil math and everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of turf grass management perspective,
like large scale agriculture, vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: farms, kind of figuring out how to combine
all of that to a system that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work good in a soil-less media in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I learned a lot specifically when
I initially transitioned over just about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself, because I hadn't really
worked with cannabis before, so learning
[SPEAKER_00]: photo periods, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then from then on, just kind of
dialing in the nutrient program over time
[SPEAKER_00]: after I kind of gone through and figured
out how I wanted to be doing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: math, slowly kind of figuring out what
works best for us in our greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously every growing system is
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figuring out how to adapt what I
learned through other people for our
[SPEAKER_00]: specific situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was able to do the soil fertility
course a few years ago, and that was super
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, just kind of giving me a path to
kind of figure out how to bridge that gap
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Bryant Mason's course is a good
resource for people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how to do their own soil
fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do actually... Oh, I was just going to
throw out a shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you type in kiss organics, all one
word, I think you get a discount on it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that, but yeah, getting back
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first got here, how were you
guys managing fertility in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I initially started, I got hired
on as an assistant kind of to start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a fertility manager who
was kind of transitioning out at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his own method of kind of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was using the soil doctor class
as well as kind of a guide as far as our
[SPEAKER_00]: targets and everything go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had kind of that like framework
that we were using, but we were really,
[SPEAKER_00]: once he left, we were kind of basically
taking old soil amendment plans that he
[SPEAKER_00]: had created and still soil testing and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like looking at those with their,
the soil tests they were referencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of using our current soil
tests and kind of trying to extrapolate
[SPEAKER_00]: off of that and figure out like,
okay, well, he did this for this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we adjust that for our current
situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a period where we were kind of,
we're using a fertilizer mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were just kind of broadly
targeting all nutrients, making sure we
[SPEAKER_00]: had fertility in every area there,
which was good for a while, but I do feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it ended up with us kind of adding
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting into situations where we
had high sulfur or high magnesium that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have a way to with this mix to
apply nitrogen without also adding that
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from then we kind of started to
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first summer was about like that where
we were doing the, using the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and kind of extrapolating old data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going into the winter,
I was able to go through that course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, just kind of figure out how
to start targeting specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, figuring out how to bridge
the gap with my soil math to make it match
[SPEAKER_00]: up for what I want to be doing for like a
soilless media, because obviously there's
[SPEAKER_00]: huge differences between the soilless
media versus an actual soil outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so figuring out what I need to take
into account and disregard and stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: our container grown plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point we did, we sent some soil
tests off to both you and the soil doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I kind of did my own like amendment
plan for it and then compared it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: two and was like, okay, well, I'm not a
hundred percent accurate, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: super far off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use that to kind of double check some
work and everything and keep like building
[SPEAKER_00]: up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was about the, that's kind of the
initial stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are unfamiliar,
I just want to back up on a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and state that collective
elevation, if you want to see the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're talking about, there is a
YouTube tour on our kiss organics YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel that people can go back and watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of the soil that you have
is our commercial growers mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what was in the beds, but you guys
got that in years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think even before you were at
collective, so it's really your soil at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started, we were, so we had two
nexus greenhouses that have had soil
[SPEAKER_00]: number about, I think it's about seven
years old at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very old soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pre kiss oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they mix that up themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I started that summer,
we were building out our next gen
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones that we filled with
the kiss oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were kind of my first fall here
was my first cycle through with kiss oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even within that, it's really cool
to see just like wide differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two soils and even between the
greenhouses with that kiss oil in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because over time we just get through
micro climates and everything within the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to just see different trends
based off which our North greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: versus our South greenhouse with how
they're lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of small micro climates within the
greenhouses themselves, just in the beds
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything kind of like getting to
spend the time in there to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: observe that and actually notice it has
been super, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've started to kind of tailor
each amendment plan towards each
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and then our season and
everything as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that when you mentioned
soilless media being different than actual
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, what you're referencing is actually
this kiss oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're calling living soil indoors
is not actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have sand, salt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what agronomists would call soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just case people are confusing the
terminology because it is confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that your soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that actually look like in
reality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like take me through when in the cycle you
take those tests, when you get them back
[SPEAKER_01]: and then how you use that interpretation
as a guidance for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the timing on it,
we're taking it about day 56 of flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the latest I can take it and still
get them back in reasonable enough time
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to do our amendment before our next
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard because obviously I'd rather
wait later, take them right at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle, but being commercial
production, we kind of got to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously they're a little less
accurate with taking them earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that process itself is we have a soil
core probe thing that we're taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: test with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking, I usually go about every eight
feet in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, your soil test is only as good as
your sample is representative of your
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to get the most representative
sample as I can, which is obviously you're
[SPEAKER_00]: never going to get that unless you tested
the entirety of your soil volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: but making sure that I'm taking a wide
range of tests from all over in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse so that I can have as,
as representative of the sample as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending those off to Logan labs,
great lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually get our results back super quickly
and everything from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just like the layout of their,
how they present the data and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are typically doing, I think it's their
complete test, but it is a standard Malik
[SPEAKER_00]: three soil test, a saturated pace test
where we're sending our own water in with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they give us like our
micronutrients and like our silica and our
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate numbers and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I've noticed,
and I've talked to Bryant about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is we've had guys test every bed
individually, and then also test the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire room, you know, maybe, so maybe
like 20 tests as composed, like one
[SPEAKER_01]: composite test that's, that's mixed of all
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all tend to be fairly similar
unless we have like one real outlier bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, has your experience sort of agreed
with that and how many tests do you do per
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and how big approximately is
your greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing composite tests with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we have done individual beds
and sent those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of found the same thing where
we were like within 10 to 20% at the most
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is, would be like,
we're testing a bed that is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: getting less light versus one that gets a
ton of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're seeing like the
slight differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so for the most part, we're sending
off a composite sample for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we have four houses altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact square footage of
the house itself, but we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller ones, we have four rows of 84 feet
by four feet wide by about two feet deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then in our larger greenhouses,
we have six rows of 88 feet at about a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot and a half deep, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit different volume there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you found that one test gives you a
pretty good idea of what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room and that saves a ton of money as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are thinking about going this
route, don't feel like you have to test
[SPEAKER_01]: every bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it gives you a pretty good
composite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say if you, if you feel like
you have something going on in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if there's a bed that's wildly
behaving differently than others,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, tissue testing as
well, just to know what's going on inside
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, um, we tissue test periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do it every single round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'd like to do every single
round, but at a certain point you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to balance those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know how much data are we
getting and using, um, kind of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, yeah, the tissue testing can be
really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a situation like that,
um, and in the past we've done that
[SPEAKER_00]: typically when we have a greenhouse where
it's like something seems off,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually pretty representative of
what our saturated pace test is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as long as you are getting adequate
water, getting not just adequate water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but getting a good watering program to
where your plants are able to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: those plant available nutrients that
you're seeing in that saturated pace test,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually pretty representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a, that's a great point
touching on the watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just add one note that taking one
test for a room is sort of predicated on
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea that you're treating all the beds
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start amending all the beds
individually different, I think then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of forcing your hand into
having to test them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but how does, how does water play a
role in, um, well, I mean, I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, how does water play a role in terms
of nutrient availability, but I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of a obvious one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how do you have a real life example
though of how, uh, irrigation changes have
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted available fertility in your beds
where maybe you had sufficient fertility,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was too cold or you weren't
watering properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just with the, the microclimates kind
of in the greenhouse in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, our nexus greenhouses, we have there
east to west facing the east end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall gets shaded out in the morning time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a solid like about six foot
section of that bed that gets considerably
[SPEAKER_00]: less light for the first few hours of the
day in those beds, which again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this isn't just directly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then that's also bringing light into
account, but in those beds, they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they always are holding water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those sections are holding water
significantly longer than the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and with those, we will see a lot more
kind of towards the end of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: like plants that look not as far along as
the rest of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants that don't look as developed,
they maybe are still a little too dark
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like they have too much
nitrogen at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been like processing as much
because they just haven't been taking up
[SPEAKER_00]: as much water due to not having as much
light and also just, um, I just having a
[SPEAKER_00]: more saturated environment around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we've also seen the case too,
where with underwater, like with the
tension, but we're seeing that this is
too.
Not enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alas, and then when you have some of those
things that look like nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies, but the soil itself might
not be deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is just not getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't have the proper
environment around the plant for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we kind of see that just seasonal
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have areas in the summertime,
but just get blasted by sunlight and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are like an, at least a touch up water
almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down to the winter time,
we have room sometimes where we'll go like
[SPEAKER_00]: four days without watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just really is, there's a lot of
huge seasonal variability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the best representation
of how water and water availability kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of plays a role in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not treating the whole
greenhouse the exact same way when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to irrigation, you're basing it on
the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are you measuring that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure both through, we have a Blue
Lab pulse, which does volumetric water
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our main source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the aerometer probes, the
tensiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that gives us a more accurate
kind of idea of what the plant itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: going through because the volumetric water
content is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the number kind of, if you're doing a
certain number dry back on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really only applicable to that
specific room that you found that number
[SPEAKER_00]: is like a good one for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start looking at, because we do
have different soils and different rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say 15% dry back in some of our
zones is a lot different stress than 15%
[SPEAKER_00]: dry back would be in some other ones,
just because we have older soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller pore space, it's holding onto that
water a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might have the same volumetric water
content, but the tension that it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: takes the roots to pull that in is a lot
more, and it's a lot more just osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the main way we're going about it is
using, we have aerometers in every
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, kind of checking those and
watering based off of certain KPA numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're transitioning into where
we're going to start testing out some
[SPEAKER_00]: volumetric water content probes that will
vary in the beds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of the process with that is
going to be putting a probe in the bed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also putting an aerometer next to it,
watching what, finding out what 20 KPA on
[SPEAKER_00]: our aerometer actually is as far as dry
back for our plants and kind of adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: our numbers based off that for each room
specifically rather than just the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very cool, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the way you explained that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Blue Lab pulse meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we sell them at KISS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're a really cool tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a very fast number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that I can correlate a photo in
the app with the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aerometers are going to be more
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to highlight where you
said you can't take the same percentage on
[SPEAKER_01]: that volumetric reading on the pulse meter
and use it across different media and
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to get the same results,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing that you mentioned around
when you time your soil tests that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to add, because I happen to just
know this, that you guys keep all the
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that you use on site so that
when you go to re-amend, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: place an order with a company to like or
run somewhere to go get these amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have them all on site and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you get results back, you can
amend right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we basically we have half a
fertilizer store essentially in our pole
[SPEAKER_00]: barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I've gone a little crazy in my
ordering in the past and gotten really
[SPEAKER_00]: hyped about some specific nutrients and
ordered a lot of them and then realized I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't need that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your what are your go tos and
what do you see yourself using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the same question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see yourself using the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of your favorite amendments and I
guess trends in your soil fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed a lot since over the last few
years, just as I'm kind of figuring more
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main kind of idea is I want to have for
every nutrient we have, I want to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: two different sources for it if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, like say calcium, for example,
if I'm only feeding gypsum and I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding potassium sulfate, and maybe
magnesium sulfate, I'm probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get too high a sulfur at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure I also have like something
like an AgCil so that I can switch off or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll ask tonight for the calcium so
that I can switch off and like add calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: in a different form and kind of not take
anything out of out of where I want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be just to get other nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say as far as historically our
main amendments have been we've used a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fish meal, soybean meal, insect frass,
gypsum, sulfate, of potash as like rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust as well as a more recently kind of
currently right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shifting some of our nitrogen
towards using blood meal, feather meal as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of our main nitrogen sources just so
we have that like standalone 13 zero zero
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than having the phosphorus or the
potassium attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I'm playing with right now
that I'm really excited about is I'm kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of trying to I'm taking my nitrogen goal
and I'm breaking it up into portions with
[SPEAKER_00]: different breakdown rates for my
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing like a 25% portion of kind of
a blood meal which is a quicker breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they have it more more available
earlier than like the middle section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing like a moderate breakdown at
about 50% of our nitrogen goal and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: slow breakdown as the last like 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting like kind of a broad
spectrum of different nitrogen sources in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that will be available at different
times as the plant needs it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of trying to front load our
nitrogen availability a bit but then also
[SPEAKER_00]: have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a better guessing game and I
totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always with our recommendations want to
have at least two to three sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like organic alfalfa meal even
though it's not a big nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it has a lot of good like
microbial benefits and other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: it does that I like to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah that's a really good point that
you brought up around having multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: sources for different amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and we definitely went through a
phase where we used a lot of alfalfa meal
[SPEAKER_00]: and I use it in all of our teas and
everything as part of that recipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we do do some like supplemental
feeding throughout the cycle I'll use it
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah as you're saying it's really
really really low nitrogen percentage but
[SPEAKER_00]: you do get carbon from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good carbon source and
everything and just organic source for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and we've used a lot of kelp meal as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's we've used basically most of the
organic inputs you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few bags of them out there so
yeah kind of gone through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll ask tonight's one that we've been
using a lot more recently just because we
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting high sulfur in some
greenhouses and I was like all right I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to figure out how to go around this
and not keep adding sulfur because at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point you're just creating osmotic
stress for your plants and it's just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: create a more stressful environment for
them and we want to we have enough other
[SPEAKER_00]: stressors that I want to try to limit as
much of that as possible on my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to kind of use stress to like
try to do crop steering if they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed so trying to figure out how to
yeah keep them in a good spot and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that again whatever I'm amending I've
got multiple options so that I can really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of per soil test kind of customize
what we're doing each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah sulfur is an interesting one because
typically I find with our soil test is we
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to range more alkaline because of the
our in love our inputs are cations you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're using calcium a lot of
potassium and so we tend to push the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to be high so the sulfur really
helps balance that but what and we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really see any issues with sulfur
toxicities per se but you we brought up
[SPEAKER_01]: the big issue with sulfur which is
essentially when you have very excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: levels you know and I've seen thousands of
PPM of sulfur on soil tests what can
[SPEAKER_01]: happen is your soluble salt the EC of your
soil becomes higher and then it's harder
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant to essentially acquire those
nutrients because of the osmotic pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: around the roots so yeah just wanted to
further explain what you were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about because I think that's a really
fascinating concept so as as a soil you
[SPEAKER_01]: know fertility manager you're always doing
this dance of balance with your nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that being said something that that Bryant
always said that I really appreciate it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I take the same philosophy as we
always start with I always start with
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency and then balance what is sort
of been your approach with with this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process I would say very similar as well
like taking into account both the
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated and the standard tests I'm
trying to make sure that we have obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient available nutrients to the
plants but then making sure that we're in
[SPEAKER_00]: a situation where if I am wildly out of
black on my cations like if my ratios are
[SPEAKER_00]: not down in there if I have like nuclear
high which just doesn't hasn't happened
[SPEAKER_00]: too much but um if I have out of whack
like calcium or anything like that where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of sitting high as in as far as
like our ratios of the rest of the cations
[SPEAKER_00]: it maybe makes me kind of pause for a
second about adding to try to up my
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste test because if we are at
a high situation there then we do have it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil it's just about getting it um
plant available and like uh mineralized
[SPEAKER_00]: over and everything or demineralized um
yeah so it's definitely kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency first is the main idea and
then without completely like disregarding
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in our standard test and
making sure we're not getting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where we're going to run into
issues with nutrients being tied up and
[SPEAKER_01]: not become plant available um yeah nice
nice and uh do you have any examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: where you saw something on a soil test
that was then reflected in the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were able to address or correct in a
way that increased yields or fertility or
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health high nitrogen at harvest I
have definitely put too much when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started kind of uh running the nutrient
program there's a period where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely throwing too much nitrogen in
there um we're seeing still plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't fully they're full not fully green
but they were still a lot greener than we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted them to be at the end um and then
coming back on our soil test around like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 ppm of nitrate at the end of it which
isn't where I want to be um trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot more towards ending at like 20 to 30
has been what I've seen like do really
[SPEAKER_00]: well for us um and then just kind of
lowering that top end nitrogen goal down a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit to try to ease us into that lower
finishing at that lower area um that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a really big thing in winter
specifically just because we go from
[SPEAKER_00]: having such intense sunlight in the
summertime to when we're in January
[SPEAKER_00]: February here if we got curtains closed up
or we're sitting maybe a little bit under
[SPEAKER_00]: what we should be with light by a few
hundred par um and so we're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: processing less nitrogen and so I have to
change my thinking for sure on our
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime runs versus our wintertime runs
and now I'm kind of uh coming up with
[SPEAKER_00]: different sets of parameters for the two
of them um treating the summers a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: differently pushing more nitrogen um kind
of pushing just more nutrients in general
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're going to go through more of
them and then in the winter time just
[SPEAKER_00]: having a really light hand there just like
getting them up to what I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency is and trying to just ride it
out and watch the plants yeah I know
[SPEAKER_01]: Bryant has talked about how nitrogen
availability especially outdoors is is
[SPEAKER_01]: tied fairly closely with temp with soil
temperature and indoors even I would
[SPEAKER_01]: assume in your greenhouses it's a little
bit colder in the winter than it is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer naturally and so you probably would
have less nitrogen cycling and um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: we routinely see soil tests where you're
at the one two three ppm of nitrate at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the cycle and conversely those
plants it's like I I know you left some
[SPEAKER_01]: yield on the table and definitely some
plant health because the plant completely
[SPEAKER_01]: ran out of nitrogen so hitting that sweet
spot which I'd agree with you 20 30 ppm is
[SPEAKER_01]: a great finishing spot for for nitrates um
it makes a huge difference in overall
[SPEAKER_00]: yield yes yeah I know like you said it's
kind of like it's threading that needle
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's um you have to find that
balance to where you're not ending too
[SPEAKER_00]: completely like just zapped out of
nitrogen like you have to end with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount still to where you're not
getting you don't ever for me personally
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't ever want to see I want to
see actual natural senescence from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants where they are fading because of
their age and because of their maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: level not yellowing out because they're
depleted of nitrogen towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: their cycle and we've definitely had
periods of that too where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: intense on and everything and they they
process through that nutrient quicker than
[SPEAKER_00]: we maybe expected them to and we start to
see maybe instead of two weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest where we start to see color
changes happen we start to see that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four weeks before like some
yellowing start um and so definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out over time like my initial
first year here we had a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: high nutrients a lot of low nutrients and
it's just been trying to slowly just bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that to balance um over time but yeah
that's very that's very uh honest of you
[SPEAKER_00]: to admit that yeah it was it's a learning
process for sure and anyone that's like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I for sure know the 100 correct way to do
this is probably projecting a bit but yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: these soil tests are not always 100
accurate too so you kind of have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: them with a grain of salt and I always
like to air a little bit low because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can always add more but you can't really
take away so yeah what is your approach if
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you are mid-cycle and you really
realize that you're low in and we can just
[SPEAKER_01]: stay with nitrogen just to keep it simple
um what's your approach to combating that
[SPEAKER_00]: so especially for mid-cycle it's very very
like I'm being very cautious with how much
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to add um through that we add a
bit through teas and stuff but it's a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty small amount so it's hard to
account for too much with that um but
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been more recently we worked with uh
David Perrone um and he kind of introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: us to this like whole slurry method of
applying nutrients down so more recently
[SPEAKER_00]: um over the summertime we've been applying
just with water through a pump and through
[SPEAKER_00]: a hose or some nitrogen early into flower
like the first week of flower or so if we
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like we needed it to kind of give
them that bump but it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a really short window where once
you're into flower you got a few weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can amend and not be too far
along into it so it's a really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: delicate time frame for the plants um
typically it's been in the past before we
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing the slurries it was just
kind of like top dressing some fish meal
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff but again that's like for me if
you're seeing if you're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency and then applying nutrients
it's almost too late because for me I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's you're waiting until you're
seeing what kind of the uh the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: side effect of not having something before
adjusting it and so for the most part I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to stay like proactive rather than
reactive with that but again there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: needle that you got to thread there um and
then again if you're top dressing a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient then it's you still have to wait
for that to break down become available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants so there's still kind of even
once you amend there's like a little few
[SPEAKER_00]: more days at a minimum of time where it's
still not getting that yet so I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: slurry has been really good as far as just
helping us kind of disperse our nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot easier with a lot less like manual
labor put into it um as far as our like
[SPEAKER_00]: flips go our in between cycles um kind of
a re-amend process between cycles we've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken that from being like a four or five
person job that takes about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of hours down to a just me job that
takes about three hours so it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: really helpful in that regard um then
obviously to kind of not exposing as many
[SPEAKER_00]: people to the dust and everything that
comes off of these like even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing good PPE and everything if you're
exposing yourself to the last night and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that on the regular it's not
great for you so trying to kind of limit
[SPEAKER_00]: it's I'm basically the only one working
with nutrients now I know the proper PPE I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be wearing when I'm working with
them and everything and so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: helped us simplify that a lot that's
that's great so what does what does your
[SPEAKER_01]: process look like for re-amending because
you mentioned you top dress are you mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients into the soil when you
re-amend or are you top just top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: them how does the slurry method you
describe that a little more too and for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure yeah so um previous to using that
method we were just kind of applying the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to the top of the soil and then
we would usually just kind of like we just
[SPEAKER_00]: call it like a scratching them in
basically where we're kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure we're not we're getting them
mixed in with the top three inches of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil layer um about once a year we usually
take some soil out and add some peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: back in or something and then we'll do
like a more of a full like kind of till at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point but for the most part we were
just scratching into the top surface
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure we weren't having things kind
of cake up um with the slurry itself it
[SPEAKER_00]: works really good at kind of like
dispersing it on its own already a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: our soluble nutrients just kind of get
moved throughout the soil um and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot less we again basically just
come by and scratch it into that first
[SPEAKER_00]: little top layer after doing the slurry
amendment um but for the process itself
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of i get the soil test back um
go through analyze them obviously like
[SPEAKER_00]: look at right do i need to leach these
beds first off before anything else if i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need a leech or anything if we're
looking good there then it's looking at ph
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments or like soil structure
adjustments if we need to do anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: adding any other media or anything to it
um and then kind of going down and just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at bar obviously our
macronutrients our npk looking at calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium sulfur and everything um those
are the ones i am like most focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously those are the ones that have the
biggest impact um really making sure we
[SPEAKER_00]: show up those holes um and also taking
into our kind of micronutrients and our
[SPEAKER_00]: trace minerals those are just ones where
i'm very wary to make adjustments because
[SPEAKER_00]: you mess that up and you mess the soil up
so um yeah so and then uh kind of now what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been doing recently too is adding a
bit of biochar in between each round
[SPEAKER_00]: adding some compost in between each round
to try to just add a little more back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil from what we're taking out
throughout that cycle a couple questions
[SPEAKER_01]: so uh question number one if you're just
scratching it in and not uh you know well
[SPEAKER_01]: i guess we'll use the word tilling because
that's what people are familiar with um
[SPEAKER_01]: what about the bulk density of the soil so
over time with water with everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil is compressing down that's why when
we you know if you put soil out fresh soil
[SPEAKER_01]: out in your garden bed the beginning of
this garden season you come back out the
[SPEAKER_01]: end and it's dropped four inches and
you're like where did that soil go it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's compressing in bulk density which
limits the amount of air and water that
[SPEAKER_01]: the pore space essentially in that soil do
you find that to be an issue at all with
[SPEAKER_00]: uh your method or just like an annual
reset we so with that we do kind of a once
[SPEAKER_00]: a year we pull some soil add some peat
moss typically back in um add some
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration and if we feel like we need it
and stuff too and then we do a big massive
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of full bed till that usually helps
up the soil volume just from incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: that air and everything back into it and
then we definitely do see like a settling
[SPEAKER_00]: um for the most part a lot of our like
i'll use zones one and two for example
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the ones without the kiss soil
those ones have been processed so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that at a certain point it almost looks
like we're just growing and we're casting
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have a lot of kind of bigger pore
space in those um we definitely do see
[SPEAKER_00]: settling still in everything but i feel
like we reset it on a quick enough base or
[SPEAKER_00]: on a regular enough basis to where we're
not getting too many issues with large
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of compaction like we're still
getting good root penetration and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything um still getting good water
penetration stuff but it definitely it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not ideal obviously to have
like that that soil get super compact but
[SPEAKER_00]: i feel like we're kind of on a good
schedule to where we're well balancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of labor we're putting into it and
also balancing kind of trying to not
[SPEAKER_00]: disturb too much of the soil structure
since we do have a lot of fungus and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything growing within our beds um i
feel like we're on a good middle ground of
[SPEAKER_00]: not fully like no till but not fully
complete till every time so we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to shoot that gap where it's like
do what's best for our soil structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: balance out also our labor costs and
everything with it and also trying to uh
[SPEAKER_00]: give the soil time to establish itself as
kind of more of a obviously it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as an outdoor soil but as more of an
ecosystem within itself yeah now that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense you don't want to disturb the
microorganisms i know that's the big
[SPEAKER_01]: reason people don't like toilet tilling or
soil disturbance on any level so and i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of i'm like i'm in the middle on that
because i'm not sure like how much it it
[SPEAKER_00]: would take a lot of monitoring and testing
things to see how much that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: messes with us like we would have to not
till some beds till some beds and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see what happens over time i definitely
feel like we get better root penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: after we do our big turn and everything
and after we lighten that soil up and i
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's good too just as far as like
the stratification of our nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in there because you don't want
to get to the point where you have if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't till it ever you're going to end up
getting layers of nutrients that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: and less mobile than the other ones and so
i think it is good to kind of just refresh
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil mix that all back up and kind of
redisperse all those nutrients as well
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i mean i'm a big fan of soil
disturbance as you probably know um yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: i've talked about on this podcast um i
think these microbes are more resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: than people give them credit for i do as
well yeah but i i see really happy plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in soil that is grown in no-till indoor
beds as well as soil that's been highly
[SPEAKER_01]: disturbed so um i think there's a lot of
ways to grow this plant and uh i think you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of bridge a good gap there of of kind
of maybe addressing both ways and so now
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing you're saying is uh
maybe less soil disturbance because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking your soil recommendations that
you've you've set based on your targets
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking that you know fish meal
gypsum last night combo of inputs putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them into like a giant vat agitating it
and then essentially just putting it all
[SPEAKER_01]: out with water in the form of a slurry
over those beds is that accurate yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty accurate um yeah yeah that's that's
essentially the process and through doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it we've obviously like i've found
something some nutrients work better with
[SPEAKER_00]: it some don't like if i'm using soft rock
phosphate it's hard to get that to not
[SPEAKER_00]: settle on the bottom um there's definitely
a carrying capacity too for the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tanks that we have and um how many how
much fertilizer we can put in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of water so it's like been
finding that out um and again like like
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa for example we ended up just a lot
of it would just kind of float to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: and so then we wouldn't get very much we
would get a lot of like what looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa stems coming out initially and
then we would get no alfalfa kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out for a while and then as the
tank emptied we'd start to get more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lighter material so kind of going
through that and figuring out which which
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are better for it and not and
there's some things that we apply like dry
[SPEAKER_00]: still like i apply rock dust um still just
by like putting it out dry and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and same with like if i am using soft rock
phosphate um yeah and so just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out it's it's not a full it's not
like every single fertilizer is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work great with it and obviously we could
probably do some of our heavier amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: if we had less total amendments in there
with the water um yeah for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it's been really helpful just being
able to kind of get that done a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker and again it's uh i feel like it's
a more even process as long as we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate agitation in our tanks um it's
been a trial and error process of just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figuring out it's like all right
do i need one pump two pumps during this
[SPEAKER_00]: which way do i need to ramp them and like
all the little things that go into that so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so you kind of addressed a couple of
my questions like how do you some things
[SPEAKER_01]: just aren't great to use with this method
and you have to plan separately so that
[SPEAKER_01]: that was question number one uh question
number two was sort of like you said you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like it's more even and in my head i
was thinking about well if you're only
[SPEAKER_01]: taking one soil test then how would you
know if it's even or not for the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregate for the whole room you wouldn't
know if your fertility is even but i've
[SPEAKER_01]: also seen your rooms and your plants look
very uh evenly fertilized i mean the they
[SPEAKER_01]: look very homogeneous in terms of the
amount of fertility that they're getting i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see like oh there's a ton of
potassium here and none over here based on
[SPEAKER_01]: plant response so it must be working um
how do you manage like uh how long do you
[SPEAKER_01]: water a certain bed like do you just go do
you count to five and then go to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: bed or next walk 10 steps or yeah how do
you get that part of an even flow rate out
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the bed so just watching we have a
it's more just going by gallon markers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the tanks themselves um and we're playing
a lot so per row i'm applying about 100
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water overall per row um and
those are the 84 foot rows to 88 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on which greenhouse we're in um
and so typically just checking back in
[SPEAKER_00]: make it seeing where my numbers add on
that and everything um and it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: is not uh it's not 100 like i know i got
exactly the same amount spread across the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole room but it's just about kind of
minimizing as much difference as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: there um yeah and then just making sure
basically i'm going by the gallon numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got a pretty consistent for the first
two and a half years for when i started
[SPEAKER_00]: here i was hand watering everything and i
got pretty good pace down on my hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watered or it's like i move it about the
same speed with everything so it's uh just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keeping that same pace with it um
making sure you're trying to distribute it
[SPEAKER_01]: as evenly as possible um yeah so you're
you're just finishing up with your tank
[SPEAKER_01]: right as you hit the end of the row kind
of at the end of the bed yeah at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: uh so i use like one 250 gallon or one 200
gallon tank um it's 250 gallons but i
[SPEAKER_00]: usually fill it up to 200 per like two
beds or two rows essentially and so i can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of do one up one back on one row and
then one up one back on the next row and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's usually right about at the end of
the 200 and that saves you a ton of time
[SPEAKER_01]: in labor tons yes application awesome well
cool yeah that's a very handy tip that
[SPEAKER_00]: people can experiment with yeah yeah
definitely a lot of trial and error with
[SPEAKER_00]: it um we have to use a giant hose for it
so that's that's one thing where if you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to use a regular garden hose i think
you'd get they get clogged up pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easily so yeah just finding the right
equipment and everything and then i think
[SPEAKER_00]: we currently have like square totes that
we're doing it in if i had my my dream
[SPEAKER_00]: setup for it it'd probably be a round tank
just to help minimize settling in corners
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything yeah um yeah it's it's it's
helped reduce a ton of labor um it's
[SPEAKER_00]: helped and mostly for like the rest of the
cultivation crew all the guys that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the greenhouse right after they just
got done harvesting got to pull root balls
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that's already a very long
labor intensive process so if we can take
[SPEAKER_00]: away day a day of packing nutrients and
tilling beds that's that's super helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for them um yeah so being able to take
that kind of like off their plates and
[SPEAKER_00]: then i i like having the control and being
able to apply it myself because at least
[SPEAKER_00]: then if something goes wrong i did it so
we know we know what happened with it
[SPEAKER_00]: where in the past we've had like had some
hot spots in beds where it's like some
[SPEAKER_00]: beds are mixed really really well and then
you find a whole pile of gypsum in one bed
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just barely under the soil surface
that's turned into a giant cake so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: make it just as far as the uniform
application um yeah i feel like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really helpful awesome awesome well i
really appreciate your your time today was
[SPEAKER_01]: there any other uh any other things you
wanted to chat about here for sure nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes to mind too much um yeah i
guess that's that's just essentially kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of how the the process has developed over
time um see anything else with that no i
[SPEAKER_00]: get i think that kind of covers it we've
um we've gone through different iterations
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we've been doing we've gone
through i think the main thing is just
[SPEAKER_00]: like trial and error is a very important
uh process of figuring out if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things right and like we've varied all the
way from like teeing for example at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point we were teeing once a week all the
way down to only four times a cycle and so
[SPEAKER_00]: just like figuring out having the freedom
to be able to like test different things
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what's working best for you and
adjust it and not having kind of a like
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be stuck to one thing is i think the
biggest thing that's been really helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for me um i feel like there's a lot of
there's a lot in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like you have to do this this
way or you're entirely wrong every single
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is different there's a thousand
different ways to grow plants it all comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to what is aligning with you
ethically what aligns with your business
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything and just um in your
specific rooms themselves because again if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing under in a room with hpss
versus in a room with leds versus in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse with natural sun like those are
those by themselves just light is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: big change in environment that there is
going to be a whole domino effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else so just really having an
open mind to kind of tailoring your system
[SPEAKER_00]: to your specific grow i think is really
really important and not being stuck on
[SPEAKER_01]: specific ideas that did bring up two other
questions that i had get in before you
[SPEAKER_01]: sign off now uh you've brought up teas a
few times in this conversation can you
[SPEAKER_00]: just explain uh what that means yeah so
just a microbe tea so just um essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing we use a mix of worm castings and
uh compost mixing those with water a food
[SPEAKER_00]: source we use molasses like a sugar source
i typically add in some uh hydrolysate
[SPEAKER_00]: just to help with kind of the bubbling and
everything um as well and food for the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes as well and then some kelp and
alfalfa and essentially the idea is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the microbes from our compost and
from our worm castings we're giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: food source we're aerating them in a
liquid to help them just reproduce kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: up the concentration of how many microbes
we have in that tea and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: watering into the into the beds to help
apply it into the beds to help speed up
[SPEAKER_00]: our process of uh kind of cycling our
nutrients and everything and make a more
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available and again we've gone i'm
not still not sure what the right right
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio is to how many are doing throughout
a cycle but we've gone everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: once a week when i first started down to
like four times a cycle and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been messing with that and testing it and
seeing how we've also changed tea recipes
[SPEAKER_00]: but just messing with it and seeing like
what that affects in the plants um yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: just basically giving the plants a boost
of micro to help kind of process those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in the soil a little quicker so
you're making aerated compost teas yes
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah and uh long-winded way of saying
it yeah no people might not be familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with the term or the difference between
that and say a compost extract i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: literally staring at my microscope here
and uh don't let me forget when i come out
[SPEAKER_01]: for the conference if i drive out in
september for the conference that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on at your facility i will bring
my microscope and we can uh look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: teas and uh maybe make some make some
recipe adjustments at that point too yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's no that'd be great because yeah
because again it's uh we think we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the right thing we hope we're doing the
right thing by applying the teas but
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you scope it and are able to
actually identify what's in there it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of it's kind of a mystery so yeah
that'd be that'd be helpful that'd be fun
[SPEAKER_01]: all right well hey thanks again jared oh
last question uh you disappeared oh you're
[SPEAKER_01]: still there oh you're back okay um last
question was uh your outdoor runs yes yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys do those you handle your
fertility a little different on those
[SPEAKER_00]: right yes yeah yeah for sure um and it's
it really depends on which zone we're in
[SPEAKER_00]: outside because we have we have everything
from plants in pots to plants in beds that
[SPEAKER_00]: have soilless media on top of the soil in
the ground and then all the way to just
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the field um in just straight
up soil so yeah we kind of tailor to each
[SPEAKER_00]: zone um we test all those as well um yeah
definitely kind of approaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments differently there i'm upping my
nitrogen quite a bit since we are in like
[SPEAKER_00]: a full sun full season setting um but
again that's kind of determined by our pot
[SPEAKER_00]: size too with some of our if we're growing
in 25 gallon pots we end up having to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little more often throughout the
cycle but um with our in bed plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: with our in ground plants we can usually
get through the season off of one kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: initial feeding and then just monitoring
them from then on but yeah definitely um
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely upping our fertility overall
with a focus on upping our nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the high end of what i would ever
apply and uh yeah it's been it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dialing things in still but it's
it's been working well we've been getting
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better crops each year so now that
we're growing uh we're going kind of a big
[SPEAKER_00]: a big field of auto flowers um definitely
have to treat those a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than everything else because
they're kind of queuing in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately so it's not necessary you
don't necessarily need as much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients you'd be focusing on for like a
longer veg period um and then also we're
[SPEAKER_00]: amending into soil so i've got to take in
to take into account the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity the organic matter is actual
organic matter in this case where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been broken down over thousands of years
not just like organic matter in the form
[SPEAKER_00]: of peat um but yeah so a lot more to take
into account with the outdoor soils but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah kind of same process still nice i
just i remember coming out and seeing your
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor plants and they looked uh
phenomenal they were huge like they were
[SPEAKER_01]: trees it was great to see they got too big
yeah yeah it was uh it was fun to see
[SPEAKER_01]: though so awesome well thank you so much
for your time i really appreciate uh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure on the show we'll talk soon no i
appreciate it yeah thank you see you soon yeah
