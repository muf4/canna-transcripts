[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Jessie Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessie is a Northwest native and comes
from a strong background of horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is passionate about animals,
permaculture, and making functional
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: She travels nationwide as a speaker and is
the best-selling author of Free Range
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken Gardens and Practical Permaculture
Design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessie's work has gotten press and been
featured in many national and local media
[SPEAKER_01]: outlets from the New York Times,
Better Home and Gardens, Sunset Magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney, Martha Stewart Living,
Mother Earth News, Utne Reader,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine Gardening Magazine, and PBS's Growing
a Greener World TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Jessie quite a few years ago now,
and we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was instrumental in designing and
planning our farm and is a big part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her book, Practical Permaculture Design,
is a must-read, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: if for no other reason than to get you
thinking about how to best utilize and
[SPEAKER_01]: structure your farm or garden and get a
better understanding of how permaculture
[SPEAKER_01]: might apply in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessie, can you go on a little bit into
how you got into gardening and garden
[SPEAKER_01]: design?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a long history with working
with the earth and with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think it started when I was
really young and just love being outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and making friends with all the organisms
outside, from insects to plants to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mammals and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really loved the experience of just
being outside and having relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really trust humans that much as
a youngster.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was starting to look at careers as
I was a teenager, I wanted to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and realize that animals suffer a
lot of abuse and I couldn't quite stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, well, I can learn about plants
and make my career around plants because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to watch them suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to realize that was not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start feeling into plants,
you can start to see when they do suffer,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm sure a lot of growers can see
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really intended to become what
I've ended up doing for my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now run a company that's 20 years in
design build firm that does ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: work for both residential, commercial,
and some government work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with just a love for nature and
wanting to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My design background just grew out of
people asking me for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with me working in a
residential land care setting and people
[SPEAKER_00]: asking, well, what can I do for this space
that plant may have died or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grew and grew to the point where I
couldn't quite handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After about 10 years and I had to adjust
my life to make it what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business is still thriving and it's
been almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a lot of other things now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written three books at this point and
have been a teacher that travels around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country teaching for different media
organizations like Mother Earth News,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm doing a lot of writing for
different magazines now and really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying that aspect of my career,
but nothing beats being outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with the plants and getting my
hands in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to some of your first
talks at Mother Earth News when you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing your free range chicken,
chicken gardens tour, and you've kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved from there onto the permaculture
and now your latest book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm wondering, could you talk a
little bit about how permaculture came
[SPEAKER_01]: into your life and how that sort of became
incorporated into your design and what you
[SPEAKER_01]: do with your business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in college in the 90s,
the late 90s, I was entering an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that I didn't really know much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world of horticulture, I expected
to learn a lot about how nature
[SPEAKER_00]: functioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned botany and soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really focused on a lot of the
foundational academics of horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were also learning about pesticide
use and the things that didn't align with
[SPEAKER_00]: me or resonate at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of an angsty young adult at
that time and was kind of pissed off at
[SPEAKER_00]: what I saw in the industry as a norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just understood nature to work
beautifully on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really understand why are we
forcing all these things to grow in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't natural?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using all these chemicals that are
harmful and then we're polluting our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, at that time, was not really looking
for permaculture, but it landed in my lap
[SPEAKER_00]: through a book that was written by Bill
Mollison called Introduction to
[SPEAKER_00]: Permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an Australian, one of the founders of
the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked at the book, at first I was
like, no, this is totally common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like ecological design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to force nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to learn how to work with it
in harmony to meet our own needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time in the 90s, nobody I knew was
talking about permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had met someone at that time,
there was kind of this air about them that
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, again, didn't resonate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of took my path with
permaculture in my own way and really
[SPEAKER_00]: followed the ethics and the principles of
taking care of the earth, taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, and giving back, which that in
itself is the foundation of permaculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the ethics that it's rooted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the, like 10 years later, I want to
say, so I ran my business with
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture and my life to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, I was asked to design a garden
for Seattle Tilth, which is a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That teaches people how to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted me to design a permaculture
garden for the Northwest Flower and Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I at first was just like, yes,
of course, this is super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I live my life and I couldn't
wait to share it with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show organizers actually said,
well, we're not going to use that word in
[SPEAKER_00]: describing your garden because no one
understands what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lost opportunity, but in that show,
which the garden was really, really well
[SPEAKER_00]: received, it was called the Little Farm in
the City.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had all kinds of great systems set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man named Dave Bainline walked up to me,
anyone who knows Dave, long dreadlocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: really jolly attitude, walked up and was
like, hey, this is a great permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whoa, somebody actually knows
and appreciates what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave and I developed a friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an educator over at the Bullock
Homestead and has been for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started working together on projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works more internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business is more local.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started doing work together and
ultimately decided to write a book
[SPEAKER_00]: together after the Chicken book came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The permaculture book is now, I'm really
proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of my books like my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written now in five languages and is
used as an academic text in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges that teach permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of that book and what
it's done out in the world so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I met Dave and I started going to the
Bullock Homestead, and they've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture for about 30 plus years now,
I was amazed at how it was used in real
[SPEAKER_00]: life from not only the business
standpoint, but how people were living off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the first time going to the
Bullock's going, how can I make my life
[SPEAKER_00]: more like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just my business, but really not
producing waste and growing as much food
[SPEAKER_00]: as I could on my own and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big turning point for me to see
it more applied in multiple uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I look at permaculture as a way of
life that you can apply towards anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply it towards your finances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply it towards relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening, of course, is what most people
begin to know it from or with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really you can use it for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I love about your book is that it
really is that introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It bridges the gap between people like the
Bullocks or people like Dave who are
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing permaculturists, but for the
average person who lives in a house and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe doesn't pee on their plants or live
in a yurt, it's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge to understand how to get from
one space to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best thing I think I can say
about your book is that it helps people as
[SPEAKER_01]: an introduction into what permaculture can
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go any further though,
how would you really define permaculture
[SPEAKER_01]: for people who aren't as familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The high-level definition I would say is
it's a design system or toolkit for human
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about how we design insect
habitat or butterfly habitat or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of habitat, we're looking at how
ecological systems work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just another organism on this
planet, one species out of millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge impact in all the
environment around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Permaculture is a system of tools,
resources to help us make decisions so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can live more in harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it like how we're supposed to
live as stewards of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land and the earth offer everything
that we need, but we've gotten so far
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from that, that the systems that
we depend on now, like food systems or
[SPEAKER_00]: water systems, they're automated and
they're out of our control for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of permaculture at a high
level, it's a design system.
[SPEAKER_00]: To relate it to something like maybe
people are more familiar with like
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering or architecture, those are
also design systems where you could build
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of things, from an airplane to a
sky rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Permaculture designs our habitat and all
the systems that we rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike some other design systems,
permaculture is rooted in ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say if you take nothing else away
from permaculture as an introductory,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that the ethics are probably
the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several of them, but the three
most important or foundation are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make decisions, how are we making
a decision that impacts the earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single thing we do in life impacts
our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's what are we eating?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we fertilizing our plants with?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we spending our money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that impact the earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second ethic of caring for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people aren't taken care of or their
needs aren't met, they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take care of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with ourselves first and making
sure that our own needs are met and then
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of others around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that doesn't get a lot of,
like a lot of people don't talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: with introductory to permaculture because
people are usually focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: garden-related things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to put a lot of emphasis on
that because it's really important to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of people as they are the ones
impacting the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's fair share.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another ethic that is kind of the
altruistic element or layer where when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have an abundance of something,
we should share and give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes full circle to whether it's
taking care of people or taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an abundance of a crop or time
or knowledge, like this podcast that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do could be considered giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sharing your knowledge and other
people's knowledge with your listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways we can do it or look
at that, but that's where I always start
[SPEAKER_00]: with permaculture because some people
could think of it as like just an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening method, but that's really just
one small, well not small necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's one piece of it that we look at
whereas everything we do in life is
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by our decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start with the ethics first,
then we can start living in more harmony
[SPEAKER_00]: with the environment we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important that we
look at it beyond just a gardening system.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you say that people could use it
outside of gardening as an example?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you had mentioned engineering and
architecture, but how would a company or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone in their life incorporate
permaculture even if they weren't a
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the ways that we can apply it,
but it's a design system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're designing something,
we usually have a problem or a goal that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a business, for example, we could
first analyze what we're doing and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say we have a goal of zero waste,
which is one of the permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: principles because nature doesn't produce
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we live or run our businesses in a
way that we're not producing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would analyze first, well, how much
garbage are we producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What ways can we start to eliminate
garbage?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lesson going to the Bullocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned in the first three-day visit I
had with them, I produced zero waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even from my body, the waste that I
produced went back to the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In businesses, it's a little bit more
difficult because we use shipping plastics
[SPEAKER_00]: and we use things that maybe aren't
biodegradable that we can compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first steps we can do is look
at what kind of packaging or what are we
[SPEAKER_00]: using that we could change to be something
that is biodegradable or can be put back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're talking about a fictional
business, it's hard to give examples or
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics, but that's just one way to
start the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about growing,
for example, and I know we'll get more
[SPEAKER_00]: into this, but we're going to want to look
at what kind of inputs or resources we're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing into the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say we need a lot of fertilizers to grow
our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are those fertilizers coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we start to look at producing our
own fertilizers potentially or having
[SPEAKER_00]: something that produces nutrients and
minerals naturally so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's about creating sustainability
or closed loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A truly sustainable system isn't going to
require inputs from outside that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of landscaping or gardening,
I think the ultimate goal is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape could take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't really require a lot from us,
whether it's irrigation long-term or
[SPEAKER_00]: constant fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have the ecosystem working the
way that nature works naturally because
[SPEAKER_00]: you walk out into the forest and there's
nobody irrigating the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are adapted to the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not people out there weeding and
forcing the plants to do what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a human element that we have to
start considering when we are creating our
[SPEAKER_00]: own habitat or we're creating a product or
a system that is unnatural by ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive in a little bit to the
gardening aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you step onto a new site or a new
property, what are the first things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at in terms of evaluating it and
starting that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's layers, the ecological layers I
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is the solar budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much sun is the land getting
naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much shade is where?
[SPEAKER_00]: That changes throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that pretty easily even through
images from satellite, like Google Image
[SPEAKER_00]: or Google Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually something I do before I
even get to the property as I look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: land through satellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do research with topo maps, with soil
maps, depending on how large the property
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just have to be on the
ground to figure that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I am on the land, I can start
looking at other layers that you can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily through the computer like
soil, specifics with soil, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what climate we're in,
we either have way too much or not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, we have to find that balance
of how do we capture the water on site and
[SPEAKER_00]: use it in a way that we're really taking
care of that water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other layers may be insects or other
organisms that we're needing for habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be looking at fungal presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be looking at the existing plants
and what shape they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is really reading the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the bigger aspects of my job is
making sure that the human or whoever's
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to use the land, their goals are
realistic with what the land can offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my job becomes a little bit
more difficult because I can look at any
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape and go, okay, well, this is what
the landscape can support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if someone has an idea of they're
going to have a high production vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, for example, but yet they bought a
piece of land that has a pretty intact
[SPEAKER_00]: forest, it's like, well, there's a
conflict there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to step back and talk about the
human expectations, the needs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: human, and how the landscape can support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way that remains ecological rather
than clear-cutting and then growing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, we're removing a big part of
the ecosystem when we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every job is different when I go out to a
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every client is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, a lot of people, when they are
looking at permaculture, they want a
[SPEAKER_00]: plug-and-play, prescriptive response of
like, all right, well, what can I plant
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the five plants that are going to
do the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, I could list off 50
plants, but which ones are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use and take care of and really know how
to nurture so that they can feed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to look at and it's a
pretty, I guess, complex way of designing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, we want to make sure that
the ecosystem is sound and sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: once it's established and that the human
is happy because how often do you see a
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape that's not taken care of and
people then consider it a burden or they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to use chemicals or something that
then isn't taking care of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that most of permaculture is
focused around growing food and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you incorporate permaculture
concepts into cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on the intention of the
people growing the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at it differently if it was
commercial, like if people were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way of designing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if people are just growing it for
their own personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would treat those two clients completely
different because if we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: making money, we have to have our systems
dialed in a lot more and we have to really
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize space in a way that the room for
error is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we always got to start somewhere and
depending on that person's experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may come to the table with a lot of
knowledge with how to do it synthetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with permaculture, we really want to
shift everything to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my personal perspective or opinion is
not to use chemicals to grow medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil fertility is a big aspect of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that intakes a lot of nutrients
and minerals, we have to really figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: where those replacement minerals and
nutrients are going to come from and to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that sustainably and using products that
aren't imported from halfway across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to look at with cannabis or
any crop really is water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge aspect of making sure that
our water needs are taken care of and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not wasteful with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can capture it from the sky,
that's truly sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to consider with design
though in that system alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with cannabis, there's a spectrum
of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who are doing it inside,
people who are doing it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're doing it inside, then we're using
a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the growers that I've visited,
that's one of their biggest expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we start to look at different ways
of producing energy or getting off grid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is solar an option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we do things to raise temperatures or
to have light be something that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust a little bit easier?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of things to look at,
but if we're growing outside, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have less control of the
environment, but that also has more
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to bring in insects to create
more ecosystem and habitat so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can then be supported by other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the concepts we can use outdoors is
companion planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually invite insects that are
predators to the pests and use those as
[SPEAKER_00]: allies to the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another fun thing to play with and
it works really well in vegetable gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of cannabis like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little finicky if they're not in
the perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues that plants can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we look at nature as a resource to
take care of those potential issues or
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent them from happening potentially in
the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give some concrete examples of
some of the things you talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for example, if you're growing five
plants for your own medical garden or your
[SPEAKER_01]: own use, you may be able to add a rain
barrel off of your garden shed,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, as a way to collect enough
water for that garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our property, we have an 85-foot by
30-foot greenhouse that we added gutters
[SPEAKER_01]: to so we're able to collect a massive
amount of water that comes off of those
[SPEAKER_01]: into giant IBC totes that we can then use
to water the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water catchment is definitely something
you can look at there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about insects as another thing
through pollinator plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at planting not just a
monocrop of cannabis or whatever cash crop
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing, but incorporating in other
plants that may either offer the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to accumulate minerals and nutrients out
of the soil like comfrey or borage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also things that are going to attract
good beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any particular plants that you
like as just general pollinator plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's entire families of plants
that are known to attract specific
[SPEAKER_00]: predator insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything like in the carrot family,
so fennel is a good one, or carrots if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to let them go to seed, but of
course, there's a lot of little details to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about if you're trying to grow these
things to produce more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yarrow is one of my favorite insect
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really a bunch of them,
and a lot of it may depend on climate or
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you have rows of crops around the
outside or the perimeter, maybe along the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence, for example, you can have a
pollinator mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's seed companies that are now
starting to make these.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are really, they grow in
abundance like calendula, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just plant a few of them and every
year you're going to have more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: because they germinate so easily from
their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's to target a very specific pest
that someone's struggling with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I look at the more diversity,
the better because the more insects you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, the less pest populations you're
going to have because when there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: one type of pest and not a predator,
there's going to be population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more insects you can bring in to
stabilize that or eat those insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of it, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year you might have a problem with one
thing, the next year you might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to have as many plants as
possible, in my own opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I've seen the most success
versus just one type, but there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do better in some climates than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to give specifics not knowing
the land also, so I try to stay away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I can say calendula,
yarrow, those are two of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fennel attracts a lot, but there's a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically anything that attracts insects
is probably good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are flowers that are
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you getting help with pests,
but you're getting beauty at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do just want to caution listeners that
when you do add a pollinator mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we've done in our greenhouse
multiple years, you are creating a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more work for yourself in that these
plants also need to be maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they die, you may increase the presence
of fungal spores or powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: though not all mildews are prevalent
across all species of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because there's mildew on your
comfrey doesn't mean that it can transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: to your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find is depending on the pollinator
mix that I've used, in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: will really determine how much extra labor
I have in terms of maintaining not just
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but my actual crop that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of these, like you mentioned,
self-sow, you have to be ready for that
[SPEAKER_01]: and be aware that certain ones you may
want to get before they seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like borage, for example,
you'll have hundreds of borage plants
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up, but they're super easy to pick
out of the ground, so it's not a huge big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something to be aware of when you're
companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run our stuff sometimes a little
further away from our actual crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you worked with us on
was putting comfrey around one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable beds that we do our upick out
of, and that allows us to create a weed
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier for those weed seeds because those
leaves are so large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know at Bullocks Farm, they've used
different squashes as a way of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can cut down a couple times a year
that comfrey and apply it throughout our
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as a natural mulch that's going to
provide more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to keep down extra weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a ton of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the super plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically hits every ecological mark
that you would want from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinator, medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great root barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of calcium in its leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of really great benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though we're still fighting it where
people transplant it into the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden, and that's been a real
challenge to remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked about that on previous
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of permaculture and some of the
science aspect, one of the listeners was
[SPEAKER_01]: asking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what sort
of science may or may not support these
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture principles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny because I come from a
scientific or academic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into permaculture because I felt
that it was common sense and saw results
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, but didn't need science to
validate it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is expensive, and not a lot of
people in permaculture are necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a lot of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some out there, but it's one of
those things that, just like herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, people have been doing these
things for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, a lot of permaculture principles
come from indigenous cultures that took
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the land long before the
industrial revolution, and when living
[SPEAKER_00]: locally was really the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't science back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, telling people what to do,
they just did what they had learned and
[SPEAKER_00]: observed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the examples I like to use and
actually relates to you and how I met you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was maybe 12 years ago now,
when compost tea was something that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry was looked down upon because
there wasn't enough peer-reviewed science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a conference actually where your
dad spoke, and learned about compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit skeptical because,
of course, I'm reading the trade magazines
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, oh, there's not science
behind this, and it's snake oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner at the time wanted to
experiment with it, and so we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer, and we got started, and the
results spoke for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't need science at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow, why isn't everybody doing
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes so much sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's a lot more out there
now about that specific topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but science hasn't always been around,
but we've been around for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we've interacted with the
landscape and with plants has been
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's been passed down orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book that I just finished writing,
one of my tasks was to look at plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they were used 5,000, 6,000 years ago,
and how that knowledge was carried down
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, but it's just now,
literally in the past 100 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming validated by science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do we really need it,
or can we learn for ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard balance, especially in this
world, because with something like nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't reproduce an ecosystem indoors
or in a laboratory, so it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that comes up a lot
that I can speak about, dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is something that people ask,
well, where's the science behind?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty soft science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot out there, because not a
lot of people are looking into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the science is going towards
synthetics, and it's going towards GMOs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going towards really altering
plants, not necessarily investigating the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that we could use easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynamic accumulation, for anyone who
doesn't know the concept, is pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: in that plants use their roots,
they mine into the soil, they absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and minerals, and then store
them in their tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this happens with plants,
because we eat plants, and therefore,
[SPEAKER_00]: we eat the minerals and nutrients,
like bananas have potassium, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we just talked
about, comfrey, is known for its ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to accumulate calcium, which is kind of an
unusual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taught we're supposed to get calcium
from milk, but it's there in that plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that it's so concentrated that it's
been used for 5,000 years as a healer of
[SPEAKER_00]: bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science is there, it's just not
necessarily wrapped in a permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: package of like, here's what permaculture
can offer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not prescriptive, so every
single site and every single human and
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs are going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really a way to replicate that
in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it and try to figure out success,
because we could set up or design an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing sustainable system for someone to
be completely self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it takes is a human error,
or maybe a fencing error for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to be wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of at the hands of nature to
some degree, but also our own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at permaculture as only
something that will accept if science is
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it, we've got a ways to wait
because I don't know anybody who's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: their money towards that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're experimenting with their land and
they're trying to practice these things in
[SPEAKER_00]: real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was traveling to research for the
permaculture book, that was one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks, which was super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go all over the country and meet
people who were practicing permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my questions was, what failures
have you seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has experienced failures in
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that we learn
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different for every single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be just their expectations of
what a successful crop may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's not a lot of hard science out
there to support these concepts unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it purely from an ecological
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human expectations are what gets in the
way of what is successful, what's working,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's a lot of error that can
happen because of our choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on a lot of things there that
I want to review.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of going all the way back to
dynamic accumulators, one thing I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: point out for people that I think is a
challenge as well is if that comfrey,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, is planted in soil that is
low in calcium, that leaf tissue is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to magically accumulate high levels
of calcium if it's not available in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see these lists online all the time of
various plants and then the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that they're supposedly going to
be imparting when they're used as
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those lists can be really
misleading for growers because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that there's going to be 10% calcium
in that leaf tissue just because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know the quality in which, or the way in
which that crop was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see huge variance and any farmer
will tell you that their crops can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit just based on the soil
conditions that they're grown on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in terms of permaculture and the
science aspect, you mentioned how we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I first met you, I was very
skeptical of the term permaculture because
[SPEAKER_01]: basically everyone I had met up to that
point before meeting you and Dave really
[SPEAKER_01]: came across really a little bit arrogant
to me in terms of, oh, you're not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture, you don't know about
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you came out to our property and
looked at our farm, you shocked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember this,
but we started walking around and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Tad, this is a permaculture concept
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already doing some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the stuff that you were pointing
out, like you said, some of what
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture is is very common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's one thing that separates it
from people that are into biodynamics,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, or the energies associated
around water, these things that have not
[SPEAKER_01]: been proven and there's not a lot of
science behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about permaculture is a lot of
these concepts are design concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're common sense concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, the main purpose of them is
really to take care of the earth and to
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of the property that we're
growing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that to happen, I think it doesn't
have to be as science focused,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doesn't mean we can't apply
science to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know a lot of these permaculture
people are using compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that doesn't mean they couldn't use
the available body of knowledge that's
[SPEAKER_01]: already out there around that science and
apply it towards the way that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: making the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take aspects of science and apply
it to aspects of permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that permaculture is necessarily
anti-science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that not everything that is
happening is happening because of science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening because of, like you
mentioned, the ethics around these
[SPEAKER_01]: principles are number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important also to say
that in order to practice permaculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really helpful to have science as a
foundation in understanding the ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, like understanding soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's critical in being able to manage
soil for fertility and to grow crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrology of a site, that's really
important to look at as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of science that is important
to know in just beginning, but I like
[SPEAKER_00]: people to just experiment and to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's different when you're
trying to make money from systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a home environment, there's
definitely steps that you can take to just
[SPEAKER_00]: get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I experienced a lot or see
people have is analysis paralysis where
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't move forward until they have
all the answers they're seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can waste a lot of time and your own
learning in trying to find someone else's
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with understanding those basic
ecological systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people will look into permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, this talk will encourage people
to consider it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your book is a great resource for
people looking for an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a commercial facility that's
already growing and it could be an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: one or a greenhouse one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hope is that they will, rather than,
like you mentioned, getting paralyzed by
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get to zero waste, for example,
which is a really, really tough goal,
[SPEAKER_01]: how about instead, let's source one
fertilizer source closer to home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or let's try to reduce the amount of
packaging that we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or let's do something to make it easier
for our employees to have a better work
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very basic things that any
facility could do that would help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: and incorporate the most basic
permaculture principles into their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the principles of permaculture is
to start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go from living in mainstream
culture to completely sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time and it really takes looking
at the systems that you can change easily
[SPEAKER_00]: for the biggest impact and starting there
instead of investing a lot in a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge change that you don't have experience
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely good to just take baby
steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side of that, if you haven't
designed your property yet and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting from scratch, this is a great
tool for beginning that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get you thinking about all your
resources on that property and how you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to design the property to best
maximize workflow and what is available
[SPEAKER_01]: based on where you're located.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really encourage people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I find, having a farm and a
garden center, is that people will walk in
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy one apple tree and then they'll
plant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll come back two weeks later and
buy a walnut tree, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then over the period of five years,
you go to their property and they have all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things haphazardly scattered around
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this doesn't look like a
landscape anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if they had invested a little more
thought at the very beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: process, they could have really designed
something that made a lot more sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were happier with aesthetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting in that time, I think,
early on in your business or in your
[SPEAKER_01]: property is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what permaculture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the process of design, the steps you
take to make those decisions, the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, that's my job, is to help
people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm biased, but all in favor of
people taking the time and the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a $300 consultation,
that could save you $100,000 in mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth the time in gaining,
especially someone else's perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing about that, whether it's
cannabis or another crop or home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, one of the best ways to learn
is through someone who's already doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: in your bio region, because the climate's
going to be similar, the goals are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having conversations with people who
are already doing it is a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn and avoid certain mistakes
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a little bit of consulting here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that people ask me is,
what cover crop should they be growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, on their field through the
winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say, go talk to your neighboring
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what they've already learned that
works really well in your environment or
[SPEAKER_01]: in your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of resources out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting to know your neighbors is a big
one, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else you wanted to
cover regarding permaculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk a little bit more
about what you're up to these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to talk about whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just because you mentioned cover
crops, that's one more thing that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: added to outdoor cannabis growing is
plants that add nitrogen back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you've talked about that
on other podcasts or not, but looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes and nitrogen fixers as ground
covers even is something that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider trying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked a little bit about that,
but let's give the listeners a little
[SPEAKER_01]: background into what you have going on and
what your next book is about before we
[SPEAKER_01]: sign off for the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next book, I've written the Free Range
Chicken Gardens, which is really about
[SPEAKER_00]: creating habitat for them in an ecological
or permaculture way as they can be great
[SPEAKER_00]: allies to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Practical Permaculture book was
really intended to be an introductory
[SPEAKER_00]: design manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: My latest book is called Creating
Sanctuary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That book took it to more of a personal
level of, well, how can we create spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to be rejuvenated, to have our
needs met?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into that second ethic I talked
about of caring for people and starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with ourselves, but looking at plants as
allies and their sacred powers is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we ended up calling it in the book,
both from a historical perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also medicinal and energetic
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking across the globe at how people
have used plants throughout the ages as
[SPEAKER_00]: healers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really fun but challenging book
to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really looking for those matches of
the plants that had ancient uses and the
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind those being validated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It incorporates a lot of energetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chapter on creating sacred space
for yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets into the spiritual realm of really
taking care of yourself at a soul level
[SPEAKER_00]: and how plants can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come out this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all wrapped up, but got to wait for
design and printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
