[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before starting the podcast,
I wanted to just touch on the current
[SPEAKER_01]: situation with phylos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did reach out initially for an interview
and was told it was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then posted for questions on my
Instagram, only to spend the next two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks trying to get a response back
regarding setting up the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time of this recording,
it appears I'm not going to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them on the podcast to answer some of the
hard questions that many of you had
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding their latest announcements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that the Reggie Gaudino podcast
was timely in helping explain exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: the data can and can't be used for when
you use a genomics lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on releasing a video here in the
next two weeks with a discussion on the
[SPEAKER_01]: subject with Eleanor from Candor and
Nelson from Poetry of Plants, as I think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a really important topic and has a
lot of implications regarding the future
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis breeding and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a similar thread, the Cultivation
Classic is in Portland on May 17th and May
[SPEAKER_01]: 18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try and attend that Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're concerned about the relationship
to phylos, please go read their latest
[SPEAKER_01]: statements on their Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their website is cultivationclassic.cc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my guest this week was really great
in explaining to me some of the equations
[SPEAKER_01]: and calculations around lighting and
answering some questions I had about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Rebecca Knight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca is the senior application engineer
at BIOS Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a research and development
scientist with experience in a broad range
[SPEAKER_01]: of fields, science, engineering,
marketing, and business development.
[SPEAKER_01]: She holds a PhD in plant biology from the
University of Texas, a master's of science
[SPEAKER_01]: in agriculture and biological engineering
from Purdue, and chemical engineering and
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese undergraduate degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is passionate about vertical farming,
horticultural LEDs, plant secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metallic pathway gene expression,
and sustainable food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the senior application engineer,
she works closely with the sales team
[SPEAKER_01]: using her photo biology research
background and love of analytics to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide integration and cultivation
expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off by giving listeners a
little bit of an idea of your background
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you got into LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've always been a very technical
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my undergrad in chemical
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after working for a few years in
semiconductors, I decided to devote my
[SPEAKER_00]: life to energy efficiency and went to
Purdue to study agricultural engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the thought was to really research
how to best use biomass and bio waste for
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel, fuel and also replacing
petrochemical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in sort of a roundabout way,
that led me into looking at microalgae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microalgae led me into deep diving
into photosynthesis and what drives
[SPEAKER_00]: different biochemical pathways in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my PhD, I ended up at University of
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I was researching a, it's a single
cell organism, blue-green algae known as
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermocynicococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a heat loving cyanobacteria that
I used to really focus on what types of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stimuli affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the terpenoid pathway,
but I was also looking at gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being that if I could control
the environmental stimuli in such a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat or trigger different biochemical
pathways, I could generate hydrocarbons
[SPEAKER_00]: that could then excrete and be captured
and utilized in the petrochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this led me to learning about,
I needed to build my own photo
[SPEAKER_00]: bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do so, and I also wanted to
control over light wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to do some soldering and I
figured out how to build some LED panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually used an old Ticketmaster
ticket printing machine as my photo
[SPEAKER_00]: bioreactor shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And built the panels, built the,
what's called a chemostat in order to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had control mechanisms to monitor and
relay back the information from the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: of the microalgae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also took samples and changed the
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did perturbations with light temperature
and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of this really led me to become
really fond of LEDs and LED technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the effect that LEDs can have on
photosynthesis and on secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this led to ending up in controlled
environment agriculture, where I'm now
[SPEAKER_00]: working with growers and looking at light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my title is Senior Application
Engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work with growers of bioslighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help to optimize their growing
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help with calculations and make sure
that we're setting up the optimal lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for what they're trying to
achieve, depending on developmental stage
[SPEAKER_00]: and crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been with bioslighting for
about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've worked with other lighting
companies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a huge passion of mine,
indoor farming, vertical growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligent greenhouse systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of an interesting way
that I got into this, but it really has to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with my desire to save energy,
to look at the big picture, the process
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, but also more recently to
understand the science behind light and
[SPEAKER_00]: how light affects biochemical pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is quite the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to have you back on maybe to
talk about microalgae at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I've heard a lot
about, but I haven't really done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like a fascinating topic and
something that might have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: applications in the horticulture industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's dive into the lighting stuff
then right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the topics that you brought up that
would be really good is determining if
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are right for you and your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what exactly is an LED?
[SPEAKER_00]: So an LED is composed of semiconductor
materials that are sandwiched together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a semiconductor, and so I like to
imagine like a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each piece of bread would be a
different piece of semiconductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a semiconductor is, it's not a metal,
so it doesn't have free ranging electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: that can move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an insulator like plastic or
styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas it doesn't have free electrons,
it's somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take these two pieces of bread and
you place them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one piece has extra electrons added to
it, and another piece has electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put these together,
what happens is some of them cross over
[SPEAKER_00]: and it creates what's called a depletion
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a place where it's sort of a
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is, when you apply
voltage to that sandwich, what happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: that depletion region shrinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like a check valve,
a semiconductor, or I should say a diode
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I'm referring to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A diode is like a check valve because it
has that depletion region in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you apply voltage to that,
what happens is the high energy electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been doped on the N side will
jump over, well the depletion region
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinks, and then they jump over to the
side that's missing the electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: the P-doped side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on a law called Planck's Law,
that gap in energy releases energy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of a photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to do with the types of
chemicals that have been doped in the two
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of bread, the two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, material scientists and
chemists have been able to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: different chemicals to dope into these
semiconductor materials such that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: now make just about any color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make just about any color of a
photon come out of that band gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a really exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be, I think red was the first
one it showed up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our remote controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can make just about any color
in the visible spectrum and in non-visible
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all of these photon emissions are
identical efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the materials that are in
the chip, they could be less efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: than other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are similar in that they form a
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they form kind of a peak that has a
point at the top, which is the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's typically very narrow band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you place different colors of
these light emitting diodes on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: board, you then get this accumulated
effect of a light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also additional things people
add to the secondary optics or primary or
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary optics to change the angle that
the photons are coming out of that are
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also they will sometimes add coatings
like phosphor, which will do things to
[SPEAKER_00]: that narrow band peak, like level it off
or kind of drop it to maybe lower energy
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, you have this ability to
put together narrow peaks, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: can add chemistries to the optics in order
to change how that light's emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can basically come up with any
spectrum you desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the benefits of LEDs are
they're very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much more efficient than legacy
lighting technologies, which typically
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go through gas discharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are used up faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ignited energy is used up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this kind of solid state
technology, it's very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside is it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive to make semiconductors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive to do the optics and to
manufacture them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the prices are going down, but it's
still a much more expensive option up
[SPEAKER_00]: front than some legacy lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a general overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're saying legacy lighting,
what you're referring to is things like
[SPEAKER_01]: high pressure sodium, metal halide,
compact fluorescent lighting, those types
[SPEAKER_01]: of lighting technologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that those work is they have a
gas which is ignited by an arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arc has to come from a ballast,
which creates a high voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that high voltage is set and
the gas is ignited, in the case of high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium, the mercury then turns
into a vapor state and stays lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the differences between LEDs and
those types of fixtures is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: require that ballast that can control the
initial spark, but also the maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: energy required for the bulb to stay lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another major difference between
the legacy lighting and solid state
[SPEAKER_00]: technology like LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's talk a little bit about
efficiency then, because one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that came to light recently for me was
visiting a facility with a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit more about
these types of measurements, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: at 400 PPFD at Canopy thinking they were
at a thousand because the bulbs in their
[SPEAKER_01]: double-ended Gavitas hadn't been replaced
in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't realize that this was
going on, which is a pretty significant
[SPEAKER_01]: drop in light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how efficient are a lot of these LED
lights in terms of maintaining a spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: in light intensity over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really great observation
and example because one of the major
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between LEDs and HPS and metal
halide is that over time, the metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: and HPS, they tend to have a higher
depreciation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of it has to do with the way
in which they emit light because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: burning through the gas that's inside the
bulb and over time that depreciates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also there's other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, LEDs tend to be a little
bit more anti-static.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tend to resist dust accumulation
better than HPS or metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would be surprised how much dust
and debris can actually drop light
[SPEAKER_00]: emission from a fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you imagine putting your
sunglasses in a grow room, the next day or
[SPEAKER_00]: two days later, you're probably going to
need to wipe them off before you wear
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because in the grow room,
there's moisture and debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time, you might not see that
when you look at the lights directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's accumulation that's actually
dropping your light output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there tends to be more of that with
legacy lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have both the drop in efficiency
over time that's much faster than with
[SPEAKER_00]: solid state technology, but you also have
more dust accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not relamping and replacing
the lamps fast enough, then it could
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely impact your grow operation and
your productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a very good case for having
a PAR meter in your growing facility or
[SPEAKER_01]: having access to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can we talk a little bit about what
you're measuring when you use a PAR meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely recommended to have a
light meter that measures PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's photosynthetically active
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be able to measure how much
light is within that range to,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you mentioned, see how it's changing
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, confirm that you're getting uniform
light onto the canopy and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting the amount of light that
you're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to describe light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to describe photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit, this is over my
head because I'm not a physicist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but light can be thought of as a particle,
even though it doesn't technically have a
[SPEAKER_00]: mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of it as a particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use the analogy of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about PPFD, which is the
photosynthetic photon flux density,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like how many drops of rain you have
in a square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of PPFD, the units are the
micromoles of photons per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use micromoles because you don't
want to have to say one times 10 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sixth moles of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use moles because it just so
happens that that unit, which is 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh boy, I believe it's 10 to the 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Avogadro's number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us nice values.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings down the numbers in the
hundreds as opposed to way too big to use
[SPEAKER_00]: on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the unit micromoles as a way to
shorten the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have nice ranges to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 to 1,000 for bloom, for example,
is a common range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for measuring that light, you
definitely want to have a light meter that
[SPEAKER_00]: can measure the number of particles that
you're getting of those photons per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the PAR meter to not only
look at light intensity, but also light
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can look at to make sure there's no,
I mean, we call them hotspots with HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's the same with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just determining that we have an even
canopy of light across the entire,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, the lighting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also can use your PAR meter to measure
within the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how quickly light is consumed
in the first few centimeters of a canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might just, out of curiosity,
test to see how your light is penetrating
[SPEAKER_00]: through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to make sure that you're
adjusting your lights so that they hit
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly onto the canopy and not wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you have grow beds,
you wouldn't want your grow light to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: the walkways or the walls, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many reasons why you would want
to have a light meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like, I can talk about
how you can do basic calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you could use your light meter to
confirm light levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would definitely like to go into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I had before we do is,
how do I, as a consumer, determine
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in LED technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I go to a trade show nowadays,
there's probably 10 different companies at
[SPEAKER_01]: that trade show all selling LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they range from purple spectrum to
adjustable full spectrum to what people
[SPEAKER_01]: are calling full spectrum lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They range in size and intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make this an apples to apples
comparison as a consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: What questions should we be asking of a
lighting company when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide a pretty major expense for a
facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I have a unique background
in that I studied photosynthesis in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most basic microorganisms on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cyanobacteria are essentially what
became the chloroplast in the land plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I studied cyanobacteria,
what I found was that the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum, it did matter whether it was
red or blue or how much green I was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my research, I did look at spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did have some differences on
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one chart that I like to show in
presentations that I think really
[SPEAKER_00]: exemplifies how land plants have evolved
is a chart that compares simple organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: like cyanobacteria, and then later
microalgae, and then later land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows how, as you go up in
complexity, the light absorption of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more complicated organisms, it broadens
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense that it broadens out to
a more even spectrum because you now have
[SPEAKER_00]: additional biomass that's reflecting and
refracting light as the light travels
[SPEAKER_00]: through the tissue to get to the
photosynthetic centers which are inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have more complicated antenna.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a variety of pigments as
accessory pigments that are helping the
[SPEAKER_00]: light drop down into the photosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from my research and from what I've
seen in the literature, as you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: land plants, you can get away with a broad
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm convinced that broad spectrum
is the way to go, but it's not just from
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is so much easier on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much easier for us to be able to
observe plants, look at them, see them
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have a broad spectrum than it is
when you have just red and blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very harsh light for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big proponent of broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes to additional
lighting, there are light responses that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not related to photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more related to developmental
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are photomorphogenic responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain light wavelengths will
definitely trigger photoreceptors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in photomorphogenic responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's really hard to make
statements that, for example, a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: user of UV light will definitely cause
additional secondary metabolites A and B,
[SPEAKER_00]: or profile changes to C and D,
in a higher productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oftentimes, treatments that cause
stress also drop overall plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a balance, just like with
microalgae, it's a balance between
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out ways to get the cells or the
plants to grow really, really strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe trigger a particular type of
biochemical response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so much complexity with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much complexity with even
microalgae, even cyanobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's hard to give blanket statements
on how particular wavelengths will affect
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and profiles of particular
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my suggestion, then, is go with a light
that gives you good overall efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: or efficacy, as they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go with one that's a broad spectrum,
so it's easier on your eyes, but also it's
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely going to be utilized by land
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look for companies that make good
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that they've had outside
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're accredited.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they know what they're talking
about when it comes to photobiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to learn about the quality of the
fixtures themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they're built strong and
industrial strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't want to invest that much
money in lights that will not last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you go with
a company that you know makes a good
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, visually, can we see differences in
full spectrum lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume there is differences,
slight differences at least, that may not
[SPEAKER_01]: be visible by the human eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one spectrum has a little bit more,
if you look at a spectrum, you'll see it
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges in nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the width of the particle,
the photon particle, and its movement
[SPEAKER_00]: through space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you look at that range,
like 300 to 700, you can actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: differences with your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one company has a broad peak,
more in the orange area, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly more orangish look in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as it's got a decent amount of
green, maybe even in the yellows,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help significantly for plant
visualization and making sure you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case there's any type of disease
outbreak, you want to be able to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have only blue and red,
then it makes it very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will look gray or black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it hard to visualize them
when you have your grow lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it fair to say, then, that at this
point in time, when comparing full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum light, it's really that every LED
company has a slightly different take on
[SPEAKER_01]: what they feel like is optimal right now
for plant growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my personal take is I want to save
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the biggest productivity
from the plant with the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's not so much about whether
the green broad peak is centered on 555 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 556.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that we make a good product that
lasts a long time, that gives a good broad
[SPEAKER_00]: range of light so that the plants can grow
most efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I can say that for my company
stance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really about making a good,
solid product that grows plants well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not really in the business of
determining exactly which nanometer
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths might affect one particular
cultivar under one set of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to make a good,
solid light that lasts a long time but is
[SPEAKER_00]: also efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been our motivation and our aim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you alluded to a good point there,
that there's a lot of variables going on
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of lighting that all affect plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is a culmination of all of
these variables, whether it's soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or environmental conditions that
will affect the plant's growth and even
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivar itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a lighting perspective,
you're just trying to give what you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: feel is optimal for a variety of
conditions and environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the genotype has a huge part in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much we don't understand
about gene expression and how all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of chemical reactions are
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for us as a lighting
manufacturer to make a solid light that
[SPEAKER_00]: provides a broad spectrum that we know
plants can utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, let's talk a little about these
calculations that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you calculate fixture efficacy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So fixture efficacy is a great one to use
when you're comparing different lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way you would calculate that is you
would divide the output of the light by
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of watts that go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the output of a grow light should be
given in units of micromole per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier, we talked about the PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the micromoles of photons per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the light puts out a set amount of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of horticultural lighting,
it's given in units of PPF, photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux, or micromoles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first red flag would be if the lighting
company doesn't provide that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be on their spec sheets and
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's measured by putting the light into
a light collecting sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sphere measures the absolute
amount of light that comes off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that value, the micromoles per
second, and you divide it by the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: watts that go into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this should be done second party
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never hurts to plug in your own
watt meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just confirm of the wattage if you're
running calculations on fixtures that you
[SPEAKER_00]: currently own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always just plug in a watt
meter into the kilowatt is one brand I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it into the wall, and you get the
actual amount of watts that are being used
[SPEAKER_00]: by that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of LEDs, they range from
the micromoles per second divided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: watts, which is joules per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: They range from around two to more recent
LEDs are coming out in the almost up to
[SPEAKER_00]: three micromoles per second divided by
joules per second, which is micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the efficacy is given in units of
micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for HBS and metal halide, they tend to
be lower just because of the nature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one way that you can compare
between different lighting systems in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply doing the light output divided
by the watts in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume that difference there is put
off in heat, essentially, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no energy loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a basic law of thermodynamics,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference there is coming off of
the light somehow with the HBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat transfer as energy, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get the same amount of photons out,
you need less wattage in for an LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the difference is just how much
difference you have on that conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: from electrical energy into photon
emission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm wondering, I'm not
phrasing this very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this set amount of energy
coming into the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The measure of efficiency is how effective
that light is at transferring that
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical energy into photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is the extra energy going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what the heat is that's put off by
more typically with HBS or metal halide
[SPEAKER_01]: lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general answer would be, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, they still do have micro levels of
heat on the chip themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have, you'll see LEDs will
either have passive or active cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: because the boards and the electrical
components generate some heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HBS and metal halide lights,
they generate more heat because of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: in which they're igniting the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of wasted heat in that
process of converting electricity into
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've heard some growers talk more
recently about heat coming off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light onto the leaf surface itself as a
benefit for that plant versus controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: it environmentally more through your HVAC
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any research on that showing
that somehow this heat exchanger or heat
[SPEAKER_01]: from the light itself along with the
photons is somehow more beneficial than in
[SPEAKER_01]: a controlled environment like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't seen the research myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love to learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more heat turns out to be the answer to
certain cultivars and that is beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are other ways to generate heat
that's more efficient than the waste heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from the HBS, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still could be cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still could give you a return on
investment if you considered switching to
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or doing LEDs instead of HBS and adding
that heat in another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see more data in the
literature about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I've heard it has to do the
directionality of the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are looking at different ways
to add heat in certain areas of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's in general, if it's just the
heating of the plant of the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I highly recommend using a more
efficient LED light and then maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat with HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more efficient that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another benefit of LEDs is in
the sense that you can go with it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower load on your HVAC system because
there is less heat being generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because typically you're battling heat in
most systems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you save on the initial conversion
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also save on the HVAC as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you calculate PPFD from photo
period in DLI?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to calculate the photon flux
density, let's say that you know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI, the daily light integral is for the
plant that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know your photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can calculate what light intensity you
would need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, let's just assume that the
plant you're growing has a DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very high daily light
integral of 60 moles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the very high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that plants have an
optimal amount of light that they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can receive that light, of course,
within boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can receive that light in a
shorter time period at a more intense
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can receive it in a longer time
period at a less intense PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to calculate what your PPFD
would be, if you know the DLI and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you're going to run the light,
then there's a set PPFD that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do the calculation, what you would
do is you would take your DLI,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 60 moles, 60 moles per meter
squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually will just do the conversions
as fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to convert those units to
end up with PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do so, you need to convert one day
equals 18 hours, in your case,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're running it for 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You convert one hour equals 3,600 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would convert one mole is 1
times 10 to the sixth micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be happy to draw this out or share
this with the audience later, if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do these calculations,
you end up with 60 times 1 times 10 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sixth, then divided by 18 times 3,600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up with 925.9 PPFD,
or 925.9 micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that tells you is, if you are
limited by a photo period of 18 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what you're going to be
running, and you know that your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs so much light, you know that it
needs, in this case, 60 moles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per day, you now know that that
light intensity is going to need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: 925.9 or so micromoles per meter squared
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you can take your light
meter and make sure that your light is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out that bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any less than that, and you're not
utilizing the plant to its full capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than that, and you're stressing the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the DLI has been determined for a
variety of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find that information in AGRA
extension papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purdue, Cornell, different universities
have published the DLI for different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you know the DLI, it really helps
you to determine how to optimize your
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, you'll want the light
meter to confirm those light levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I saw a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before I get into that, let me just
say that we'll put some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: information on the podcast page for people
who want to look at those numbers a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that was a lot of calculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was wondering, though,
in terms of DLI, I did see a trial by
[SPEAKER_01]: Allison Justice, who I've had on the
podcast, where she looked at light levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of 800 PPFD, 1,000 PPFD, and 1,200 PPFD
across a specific cultivar of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: found that this is a quick summary of the
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, that in terms of yield versus
the amount of wattage or efficiency of
[SPEAKER_01]: that yield, 1,000 was the most effective
out of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 1,200, they got slightly more
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cost to receive that yield was
higher in electricity that offset the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: of the value of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're throwing out the number 925.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of the DLI that you guys are
using for cannabis right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have any research on what's
optimal for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that number is based on an example
calculation of 60 DLI with 18-hour light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen a variety of grow
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen, it depends on the
developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've seen a whole range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with Bloom, we've seen ranging from
350 to 1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of that has to do with
the grower and all the other parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using and how they all interact,
the cultivar, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will help with providing ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also help to specify out,
for instance, greenhouses based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: average amount of DLI that the greenhouse
should receive based on the location and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much additional lighting they would
need to meet the basic requirements of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of what we recommend,
it's a conversation we have with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to find out how they've been
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also that combined with what
we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a big range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hate to give an exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think earlier I'd mentioned a lot of
people kind of use that range 800 to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: for Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just thinking about this
while you were talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the addition of supplementation of
CO2 will affect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will affect growth rates and I assume
photosynthesis rates, meaning you could
[SPEAKER_01]: run probably a higher PPFD in rooms that
are controlled with the addition of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And proper nutrient management and
fertigation would come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, which is something that I'm having
someone on to cover here real soon that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about to talk further into
about VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of these factors will help
determine your DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's important at some level to
do a little bit of experimentation in your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility to determine what's optimal for
your environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about
determining ROI and what you're calling
[SPEAKER_01]: TCO, which was a term I had never heard of
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TCO stands for total cost of ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ROI calculations, they can be very
detailed and very complicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can also be sort of more general,
back of the envelope type calculations
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend, since I'm an
engineer at heart, I'm always looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the simplest model that helps me get what
I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend start with something
pretty simple for your return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see where you are ballpark-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing an ROI comparison
with LEDs versus HPS, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to divide it up into
a few different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ROI, just to remind everyone,
is basically going to be the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time it takes for the difference in
upfront cost to equal the savings in
[SPEAKER_00]: operation of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that ratio becomes identical,
at that time point, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: when you've reached your return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, it can include a lot of
additional items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should, before you make a
purchase, definitely go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: consider all of the specifics of your
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make sure that it's right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a really kind of general comparison
would be something like, in order to match
[SPEAKER_00]: light levels, you would look at how many
lights are required for the LED versus how
[SPEAKER_00]: many lights are required for the HPS in
terms of identical light output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would take that difference as the
difference in upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have your upfront cost
difference, your initial fixture cost
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of the equation,
which is how much you're saving in
[SPEAKER_00]: operational costs, can get complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the major items you'll need to
take into account will be how much it
[SPEAKER_00]: costs to light and cool those rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that, you would just take the
amount of wattage that goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of fixtures that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would multiply that by how much
you pay in electricity for both the HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: system and also the LED light system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a really general kind of rule of thumb
estimation on the HVAC, what we do is we
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply the wattage by a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very general way to calculate
how much cooling you will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you multiply the amount of total
wattage by one third, it gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general amount of energy or cost
associated with cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the LED light system will be
less wattage overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that number is going to be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it might be more weighted on the LED
light system because you do have less heat
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to consider what are the
maintenance costs of the HPS system versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the LED light system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, there's very little
maintenance cost with LED lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas with HPS, you need to calculate
how much it costs to replace the bulbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much the bulbs cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, you end up with a very
simple calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with your operational cost per
year or per month and whatever units you
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can then determine how many months
it takes for that savings and operational
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to reach the difference in total
initial cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you would run an ROI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one factor in all of this as you were
going through that list was that I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: factor in is yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the calculations you gave were assuming
identical yields across HPS in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say double ended HPS versus LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some research that shows high
quality LEDs can out yield double ended
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are you seeing in the field on
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm seeing some research that LED can
can outperform HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also seeing research HPS
outperforms LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my perspective, it's about light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're switching from HPS to LED,
there's definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental changes that can make that
switch difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of aspects of those plants will
have to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have been selected under HPS for
many generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've almost adapted to HPS spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot that the plants might
have to adapt to when you switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might seem like switching to a broad
spectrum is worse for the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a grower that's used to HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a scientific standpoint,
photons are photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get funneled into one particular
wavelength, which drives the splitting of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants can absorb such a wide range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's tough to say one way or
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just compare photons to photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know how much light comes out,
what the total output is of an HPS system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're doing a comparison,
do an equal apples to apples comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of photons in both systems, and figure out
what would be the ROI when you compare in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my experience, and that's sort
of my view of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know a lot of growers will prefer
one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prefer maybe HPS over LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's ways to, if you wanted to save
energy, you could even look into
[SPEAKER_00]: checkerboarding or replacing half of your
HPS with LEDs, for example, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're offered an incentive that would
make that cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's ways to switch that aren't just
a complete jump from HPS to LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen studies and papers and case
studies of my papers in both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it just a lot depends on the
other environmental parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics, and also maybe those plants
have been adapted to HPS for so long that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take a few cycles for the
plants to adapt, but the growers to also
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt the environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That transition, I think, is really
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I was talking about
recently with just Jennifer from your
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm working with someone who has
double-ended HPS and has been using it for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time, and they want to integrate in
some of these LED solutions, how does that
[SPEAKER_01]: work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have to dial back the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently visited a facility that had,
I kid you not, they told me it was over
[SPEAKER_01]: $400,000 in LED lights that were just
turned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all wired in, but they didn't
know how to use them, and they had another
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting guy come in and tell them,
oh, man, your PPFD levels are way too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn on these LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they had single-ended fixtures
that they're running in that facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: single-ended HPS that they've been
running, and their PPFD levels were quite
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this lighting guy told them to just
turn on all the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they did and absolutely fried their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I've heard that you
cannot transition rapidly from plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are used to HPS light to a
higher-intensity LED light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to really work it up slowly so
the plants can adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my question is, what's best
practice right now for making that
[SPEAKER_01]: transition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it need to be done during the
vegetative cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do the plants need to be at a
lower light intensity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we be aiming for for PAR
levels when we're trying to switch plants
[SPEAKER_01]: over?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned it might take a
couple cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a general range of time it takes
for plants to really start to thrive under
[SPEAKER_01]: a different lighting spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely, you don't want to shock
the plants when it comes to the DLI,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how much light the plants are getting,
but also the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you one example of a time
when plants can get really shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when they go from veg to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're going from veg to flower,
they're dropping their photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that drop in photo period,
but then oftentimes, the DLI for flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the grower will want to increase
the PPFD in order to match the DLI with a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be a pretty big shock to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're seeing is a lot of growers
these days, when they've switched to LED,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking care in that initial
transition stage between flower and bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that the plants aren't being
shocked with a higher intensity light for
[SPEAKER_00]: a shorter period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do that by running the light at
a lower intensity over slightly ramping
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're seeing in a large operations,
even with LEDs, you'll have a heat load
[SPEAKER_00]: when the lights come on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for those periods, sometimes too,
the growers are ramping up in intensity so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the light period isn't just straight
on, but it kind of ramps up in order for
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC to not have to be shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some trends that I'm
seeing these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of switching from HPS to LED,
we have growers that just completely make
[SPEAKER_00]: the switch all across the board and do
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have growers that will switch one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know growers that switch half a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them or some will do
checkerboarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a grower is not used to growing with
LEDs, then I would say do one room or a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to feel more comfortable,
see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always measure light levels to make
sure that you're providing the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of light, because you just want to
minimize the shock to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely, it sounds like the plants
that were in that environment that you
[SPEAKER_00]: observed, they got pretty shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have time to alter their
biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, just like when we go through a
process, when we injure ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a while to heal or for things to
work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have to adjust the number of
chloroplasts or the orientation of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: organelles within the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things can take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you change conditions rapidly,
sometimes the plants can't catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, that extra energy can be
damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a recommendation,
then?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take a plant to adjust
its cuticle layer, the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: chloroplast that it has, all of these
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be a good general guideline?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize this is very general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to be adding some LED lights
in a room to plants that had been used to
[SPEAKER_01]: being grown under HPS, should I aim for
turning down the light to 50% of what it
[SPEAKER_01]: normally is for a few days?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can go up 10% every few days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's a good range for growers to aim
for if they're starting out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can only really speak to what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I live in Texas, I don't have my
own grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would do is I would start off
for the transition from veg to flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start off at 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would probably ramp it up
within that first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes close observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to watch your plants and
see how they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that works just fine, maybe the next
cycle I would ramp it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's harder for a plant that's
been damaged to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to try to minimize photo
damage and maybe aim on the slower ramp if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there signs that the plant is
receiving less light than it should be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically see?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know stretching is something that people
talk about, where you have a greater
[SPEAKER_01]: distance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, inner node distance is what I'm
referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you see for signs of less than
optimal light levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very obvious when you put too high of
light intensity on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to measure the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way in which DLIs are generated is
they're figured out based on optimal light
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're determined by biomass
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the cycle or at the end
of the day, the plant is weighed and
[SPEAKER_00]: determined to know whether or not it grew
more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it grew less at the lower level,
then it means that the higher level is
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides, as you mentioned, stretching
and inner node distance, in terms of DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations, and the papers that I refer
to from Agri Extension, they typically
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the methods they use to calculate
DLI for different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's leafy greens or vine
crops, but they'll explain how they did
[SPEAKER_00]: the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see and do those measurements
yourself to determine the optimal DLI for
[SPEAKER_00]: your particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know when you're not
providing enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind all the other parameters
that can be interacting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those are not ideal or if there's too
much of something else, that could also
[SPEAKER_00]: make the plants more sensitized to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really look closely and
watch your plants and learn through
[SPEAKER_00]: repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trial and close observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you seeing in terms of the
future of LED lighting and lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like lighting spectrum is sort of
the next big, I don't know, the great west
[SPEAKER_01]: of where technology is headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what are you seeing from growers
and research facilities on LED lighting in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of far red or increasing blue light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue or green light in a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might be unpopular when I say that
for overall plant growth, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is doing a good job with
different broad spectrum lighting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're already doing great on
the overall plant growth photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the production of secondary
metabolites, maybe changing profile or
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing biochemistry or flux down one
pathway or another, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: definite responses to certain wavelengths
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those could take years to determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be very much based on the gene
expression of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know just from my own research that
oftentimes changing the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stimuli in order to drive the production
of one compound or another, it oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: has a detrimental effect on the overall
productivity of that organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it can result in shorter life spans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to be looking at the
big picture, and it's going to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to see a lot more genetic
fingerprinting and understanding more
[SPEAKER_00]: about how cannabis plants, how their gene
expression works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's research now just starting
to be done on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to take a while
before we figure out some general rules
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to particular wavelengths of
light and how that might affect profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, I would say please
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing a significant amount of
rigorous research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or literature suggesting that certain UV
wavelengths are producing a large amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean it's not true or
it's not out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always wanting to find that kind of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely, if you can, publish your
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach the world about this amazing
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I think we're, as a company,
as a lighting manufacturer, we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on helping customers get the most
out of the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, that means giving them a solid
fixture that has good efficiency and is
[SPEAKER_00]: durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also making sure that they use the
appropriate amount of light, that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting too many fixtures for their
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also not too little in terms
of light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I'm not in the area of
researching specific wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am on the lookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we can get something out
there soon in the scientific community and
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower community that helps us know
maybe where we should be going as a
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to point out,
too, is on the UV side, I've looked into
[SPEAKER_00]: UV for LEDs for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because as many growers,
I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how it might work and
experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge for LEDs, however,
is, as I was talking earlier about solid
[SPEAKER_00]: state technology and how light's emitted
from the diode, the chips that can emit
[SPEAKER_00]: light in the UV range are not very
efficient from a solid state standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but the wavelengths
that are emitted are very powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the primary and secondary optics
that are required for LED chips that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the UV range need to be very strong
material, sometimes like quartz and other
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of really strong material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they'll become brittle or
you'll have really fast depreciation in
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if UV is something you want to
do, from an experimental standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes sense to do LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just don't see it as an option that
would make sense at this point to do UV
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the technology is not quite
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other ways to get UV,
like lizard lamps and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if somebody wanted to
experiment UV and find stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, or maybe if they want to
experiment, we could always make a UV LED
[SPEAKER_00]: for experimental purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for commercial reasons, we've chosen
to stick with a really solid wide spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: for our fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's talk a little bit about your
company now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked about BIOS really at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about what
BIOS is and the types of light that you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BIOS Lighting, its headquarters are in
Melbourne, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because several of the founders
are from NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neil Yorio is probably our best known
NASA scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there for over 20 years doing
photobiology research.
[SPEAKER_00]: For deep space habitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very well known in the industry,
in the controlled environment ag industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neil is there in Melbourne,
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a team of agricultural
engineers and scientists there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm located in Austin, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have salespeople around the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that make us
different than some of the other LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting companies are, we, from the get
go, we decided to cover the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a shadow proof glass to cover
our lights, which makes them a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also, it drops the efficacy a
little bit from the get go because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: that cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided to do it because we're all
kind of nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all very engineering minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted a product that lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted something that we could be
really proud about that was durable,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grade, strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided early on to make that
product development decision that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our lights are covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes us different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit of a harder sell
because it forces us to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lower efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still up there and we have a lot
of fantastic customers all across North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several fixtures that range from a
very thin panel that goes into a vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: racking system, which we call the Icarus
VI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our fixtures are no tools
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a bracket that slides right
into a pallet racking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to clean and keep,
it's got great ingress protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass I should mention, not only does
it protect the electronics and make
[SPEAKER_00]: waterproof, but it also, allows you to
clean the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if you, I mentioned earlier
about light degradation and if you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe the LEDs, if they're in a potting
material or they're in some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: extruded plastic, you can't actually clean
the LEDs off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to wipe them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having this glass surface,
all of our lights are easily cleaned so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can maintain the full light
output that when you first opened it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have light, we have fixtures that go
over open bed, one's called the Icarus
[SPEAKER_00]: GI2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we're engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, all of them are called Icarus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't thought of a new name yet,
but we also have greenhouse light called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Icarus TI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a linear design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's unique about that is we
incorporated a heat pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mini distillation column along
the side of the fixture, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulated low chain alcohol,
continuously condensing and re-evaporating
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow for like really amazing heat
exchange without any moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to have one of the brightest
greenhouse fixtures on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, we have bars that we
call the Icarus LI and those are daisy
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all sellable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling like hotcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can't keep up, it seems like,
but we're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the LI are really popular in all types
of applications, a lot of vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are putting them,
they're changing the orientation for inter
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using them in between towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All types of stuff can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very lightweight and cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a company, we're just very
focused on engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of us have PhDs in either
engineering or science or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a great company to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun for me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although I work out of Austin,
Texas, I'm constantly working with my team
[SPEAKER_00]: all across the country and we go to a lot
of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely look for us at different
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we've sort of played on the fact
that we're a little nerdy because we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do so great on marketing for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really behind on the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we finally just owned up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an ad in the Cannabis Business
Times where I think the title says,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just us being us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not flashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really slick in that way,
but we make a really good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the NASA connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just always had a fascination with
NASA since I was a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I love the idea that you can
clean your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are spraying stuff in rooms and
some of that material goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to keep your light fixtures
clean at maximum efficiency is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, really a huge feature,
being waterproof like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to mention that we are setting
up a trial right now at Goldleaf Gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: with my good friends Nate and Ben over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have some more data coming out
about these lights here soon that we hope
[SPEAKER_01]: to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rebecca is working with us on setting
that trial up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to add bios to our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are working with them too on some
custom lighting solutions along with
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we talked about PAR meters,
we do have the Sun System PAR meter on our
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that has some Apogee components.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we talk about top of the line PAR
meters or light meters, Apogee is the name
[SPEAKER_01]: that I keep hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be adding them to the website too
as a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are all what I've found from my
research to be really good companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard great things about bios
over the years from growers who are using
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've set up a few facilities with
your lights too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was there anything else you wanted to
add before we sign off for the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you sort of explaining
some of this LED stuff to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been putting material on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to find more, we have it on
our website, which is bioslighting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I encourage anyone, they can
reach out to me and email me if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: questions or want to learn more about the
company or have a particular application
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my email is my first initial last
name, R-K-N-I-G-H-T at bioslighting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're more than happy to talk and
answer any questions you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you don't want to do all those
calculations yourself, I'm sure Rebecca
[SPEAKER_01]: can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put the email address and all the
information and including some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: calculations that we talked about on the
podcast page for listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Rebecca, thank you for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to talking to you again
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Rebecca Knight with BIOS
Lighting, and you are listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in more information
regarding BIOS, please reach out to me
[SPEAKER_01]: directly at tadd at kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the NASA connection and they're
another solid company in the LED space
[SPEAKER_01]: that's worth considering when looking at
lighting solutions for your growing needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for checking out the podcast.
See you next time.
