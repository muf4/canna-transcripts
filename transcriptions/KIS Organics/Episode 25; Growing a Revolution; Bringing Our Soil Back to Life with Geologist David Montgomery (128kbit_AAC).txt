[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is David Montgomery.
[SPEAKER_00]: David studied geology at Stanford
University before earning his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: in geomorphology at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches at the University of Washington
where he studies the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: topography and how geological processes
shape landscapes and influence ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved maps as a kid and now writes
about the relationship of people to their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and other things that interest
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, he was named a MacArthur Fellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives with his wife Anne in Seattle,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's written multiple books, but the ones
most interesting to gardeners are Dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Erosion of Civilization, The Hidden
Half of Nature, and Growing a Revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing Our Soils Back to Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Dirt, The Erosion of Civilizations,
he explores the compelling idea that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are and have long been using up earth's
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once bare of protective vegetation and
exposed to wind and rain, cultivated soils
[SPEAKER_00]: erode bit by bit, slowly enough to be
ignored in a single lifetime, but fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough over centuries to limit the
lifespan of civilizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rich mix of history, archaeology,
and geology Dirt traces the role of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: use and abuse in the history of
Mesopotamia, ancient Greece, the Roman
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire, China, European colonialism,
Central America, and the American push
[SPEAKER_00]: westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how soil has shaped us and how we
have shaped soil as society after society
[SPEAKER_00]: has risen, prospered, and plowed through a
natural endowment of fertile dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Montgomery sees in the recent rise
of organic and no-till farming the hope
[SPEAKER_00]: for a new agricultural revolution that
might help us avoid the fate of previous
[SPEAKER_00]: civilizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In The Hidden Half of Nature, which I will
discuss in more detail with his wife,
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne Baclay, who is a co-author and also a
biologist, is a riveting exploration of
[SPEAKER_00]: how microbes are transforming the way we
see nature in ourselves and could
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionize agriculture and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in his most recent book, Growing a
Revolution, David introduces us to farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world at the heart of the
brewing soil health revolution that could
[SPEAKER_00]: help bring humanity's ailing soil back to
life remarkably fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a Revolution draws on visits to
farms in the industrialized world and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing world to show that a new
combination of farming practices can
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver innovative, cost-effective
solutions to problems farmers face today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to have him take time out of
his busy schedule for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy it and you can find his
books available online at their website at
[SPEAKER_00]: www.dig2grow.com That's dig2grow.com or
through any major bookseller or retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time
today to chat with me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start off by giving listeners
a little bit of a background into,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, your background, actually,
and how you got into so fascinated with
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I came to that interest from a
rather unusual route because
[SPEAKER_01]: professionally I'm a geologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I study the way that earth's surface
features form, the kind of geologist that
[SPEAKER_01]: studies landscape evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how rivers shape lowland terrain and
carve valleys out of mountains,
[SPEAKER_01]: what glaciers do to mountains,
what limits the height of mountains,
[SPEAKER_01]: what creates pools for fish habitat and
mountain streams in the northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what happens to rivers and volcanoes,
rivers explode, all that great geological
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that impacts the surface of the
earth that we live on, that we walk around
[SPEAKER_01]: on, and that shapes not only our daily
lives, but really sort of the whole lay of
[SPEAKER_01]: the land that we know as our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been fascinated by that for
decades professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing you want to know about
a landscape as a geomorphologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: that flavor of geologist that I am,
is, is there soil on the land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it influences how things erode,
the shape of terrain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of the first thing you want to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first issue you run into there is,
well, how fast does soil form?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it form out of?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it form?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are its properties?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how fast does it erode?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's that balance between soil
production and soil erosion that shapes
[SPEAKER_01]: how much soil we have on earth's
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came to the sort of an interest in
soil and an interest in farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about how agronomic practices
affect the cultivation of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a fairly unusual direction for
someone who thinks about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I come from sort of a bigger picture,
longer timeframe, and bottom up
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, rather than looking at it
from the top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've sort of looked at it now
from a macroscopic and a microscopic level
[SPEAKER_00]: with the books that you've written.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because when you, when you go into
looking at soil and thinking about what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it fertile and all the sort of the
complex relationships between plants
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing and soil and what's going
on around the root systems below ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: you run right into the microbial world,
that world of microscopic organisms that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, can be a great benefit to
plants, but you know, that can also be
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife, who's a biologist,
Anne Baclay, and I wrote The Hidden Half
[SPEAKER_01]: of Nature about that part of the whole
deal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I've gone from the broad
picture down to where we're hearing about
[SPEAKER_01]: things so small we can't see them,
but that have big effects that not only
[SPEAKER_01]: affect how we can grow our food and other
crops, but sort of the shape and character
[SPEAKER_01]: of earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fortunate enough to be able to talk
to Anne here soon regarding The Hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to hearing about
that book from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you tell me a little bit more
about Dirt and Growing a Revolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: what inspired you to write these two
books?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those three books together
form what Anne and I sort of partially
[SPEAKER_01]: jokingly call our Dirt Trilogy because the
Dirt Book, Dirt, the Erosion of
[SPEAKER_01]: Civilizations, was the first one in it
that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out about 10 years ago,
2007, and it's the book that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: helped pave the way for a MacArthur Award
that I got back then based, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the strength of that book and one I'd
done on the Environmental History of
[SPEAKER_01]: Salmon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that Dirt Book, what it looks at is
it's the kind of book you might expect a
[SPEAKER_01]: geologist to write about soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a backwards-looking book through
history that looks at what happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: ancient civilizations that degraded their
land enough that it compromised their
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to grow their food crops,
their fabric crops, their ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: support themselves agronomically by
degrading or losing their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it traces the course in history of
those kind of interactions literally since
[SPEAKER_01]: the dawn of agriculture right on up
through the post-war era in the 20th
[SPEAKER_01]: century when what we know today as modern
conventional agriculture, the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical-intensive variety of agriculture
really came to be the norm across
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that broad sweeping view of the
way that humanity has related to the land
[SPEAKER_01]: over the millennia and how the way we've
treated the land has in turn influenced
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that the soil has been able to
support civilizations or not once the land
[SPEAKER_01]: is degraded enough that it undercut the
ability of societies to feed and provision
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a fun look back through history
that the bottom line is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: societies that didn't take care of their
soil didn't last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we move into an era of modern
agriculture here in sort of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and Europe with the end of,
I believe that was World War II when we
[SPEAKER_00]: started to see a lot more of ammonium
nitrate and some of these fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: being used in conventional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see that influencing our
society and the impact that it's had
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there's one of the big
problems that we face in the 21st century
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the amount of really productive
farmland that we have has been decreasing
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, big theme of the dirt book
has been decreasing for longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's accelerated in the 20th
century, whereas the global human
[SPEAKER_01]: population is going up at the same time
projected over the next half century to
[SPEAKER_01]: century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those curves are working against each
other where it's going to become harder
[SPEAKER_01]: and harder to feed everybody if we have
more people and less land that's in good
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile shape to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the big concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other concerns is that the
ways that we've practiced agriculture with
[SPEAKER_01]: in the modern world with intensive
tillage, intensive fertilization and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide use really compromises all that
soil life that you'll talk with Ann about
[SPEAKER_01]: when you talk about the hidden half of
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those microbes live on the organic
matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And modern agronomic practices have
reduced that on average around the world
[SPEAKER_01]: by about 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly half of the organic matter that
was in U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: topsoil that was when we were originally
breaking ground to farm it, about half of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've drawn down the the fertility
batteries, if you will, of our nation's
[SPEAKER_01]: soils by about half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that number is roughly about right for
the world to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great concern when you think
about the problem of feeding the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also comes into concern when we
think about the quality of crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of interactions between soil
life and plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That help influence the way that mineral
micronutrients get into plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that build enzymes and that
build healthy plant bodies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: versatile on their own defensive systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also affects phytochemical
production in terms of the kinds and
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of chemicals the plants themselves
produce, which can affect their
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional quality for us or their
medicinal properties in other in other
[SPEAKER_01]: arenas and in non food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been learning that the way that
we grow our crops or the health of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil we grow them in can have a big effect
on the quality of the stuff that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I did a previous podcast with Steve
Solomon, who's the author of The
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligent Gardener and Gardening West of
the Cascades, which is a really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: book here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of his influences was Weston Price
and his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On mineralization, I guess, in soils and
how the soil in a certain area would
[SPEAKER_00]: affect a culture's dental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your findings in terms of mineral
levels in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're mentioning phytochemicals
and other influences that the nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: different soils are having on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, Weston Price and his work
is very interesting, as were others of his
[SPEAKER_01]: peers in that era in the 20s, 30s and 40s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's very difficult today to get
good sort of population level data to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and connect the health of the soil to the
health of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's examples of dental records and
other things from back in his era.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, one of the problems is that you
walk into a grocery store and there's food
[SPEAKER_01]: from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so very few people in the developed
world are eating food that's primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in soils that you can identify where
it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it come from a good, healthy soil in a
field off of a farm or did it come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: very degraded farm or a farm in a very
degraded part of the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to get studies that connect
those dots today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some very interesting ones
back in Price's day where you could make
[SPEAKER_01]: that assumption that people were eating
food that was grown fairly locally to
[SPEAKER_01]: where they lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could examine broad scale impacts
of things like the geology, the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: rocks in a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they calcium rich or were they
calcium poor, for example, in the dental
[SPEAKER_01]: studies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tracked through to sort of affect
dental health in ways that were fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be fairly crude studies by today's
standards of science, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, clear and fairly clear in my
view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that opens questions about how much
does the way we grow our food and the
[SPEAKER_01]: places that we grow it in, how much of the
character of those processes and those
[SPEAKER_01]: places really translate into things like
the mineral density in the foods that we
[SPEAKER_01]: eat and how does that translate into
health effects for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Anne and I are working on a new book
that's going to be looking into that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff in as much detail as we can find
out there in the literature as we pull it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're literally in the early stages of
working on that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to see how that turns
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just isn't enough research out there
that I've seen at least on human nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: and its relation to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've sort of touched on it in all of
your books to a certain extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in The Hidden Half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've dug into it in ways to the
extent that we could find things and to
[SPEAKER_01]: the extent that those things mapped onto
our sort of plan for the arc and flow of
[SPEAKER_01]: those books and the topics we hit on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And The Hidden Half is where we got
closest to it because we talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi in
the soil helped to provision mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: elements or to grab them out of mineral
particles in the soil and get them into
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there needs to be more data that
looks at the effect of how we grow food on
[SPEAKER_01]: those, on the mineral micronutrients,
on the phytochemicals, the kind of things
[SPEAKER_01]: in plants that we know should be affected
by agronomic practices, but for which
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionists don't tend to identify them
as nutrients because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in the case of phytochemicals,
they're not really sure what to call them
[SPEAKER_01]: or consider them, even though they have
demonstrated human health benefits in
[SPEAKER_01]: other studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there needs to be a lot more
research and look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we touched a bit on it in The
Hidden Half, as I'm sure you'll talk with
[SPEAKER_01]: her about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot more that can be dug
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to synthesize as much
of that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes me wonder what the future
of agriculture really holds in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: If at some point in time, we'll go into
the grocery store and we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: conventionally grown produce and we'll
have organic produce and maybe we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient dense produce or similar to the
wine industry where certain areas are
[SPEAKER_00]: renowned for their terroir or their
mineral content in their soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we may see something similar in
terms of vegetables that are grown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular region or grown in a particular
manner, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you look out like 20 or 30 years,
I would forecast that there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: much more in the way of what you might
think of supply chain information on where
[SPEAKER_01]: your food came from and how it was grown
at the point of purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might be able to scan a code that
would tell you, oh, this is from X farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has this much zinc and this much
beta-carotene for carrots or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could compare this batch of
carrots over here labeled whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic or regenerative or conventional
versus that batch of carrots over there
[SPEAKER_01]: and try and actually assess what's the
quality of the product as opposed to all
[SPEAKER_01]: we really know today walking into a food
store is, you know, okay, what's it
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it labeled organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it labeled conventional?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a huge spectrum of practices
in both those arenas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conventional ag and organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of what I wrote about in
the latest book, Growing Revolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was looking at farmers who had
adopted practices that rebuilt the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility of their soil and how that
affected their crop yields, their diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: use, their fertilizer use, their pesticide
use, their profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't end up looking at the
quality of the produce because there
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't, I had a hard time finding enough
data to weave in along with all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I was looking at, which is why Anne
and I are taking on this new project to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and see what kind of data has come to
light in the last couple of years since I
[SPEAKER_01]: did the research for Growing Revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in, you know, in relation to what I
think some of your listeners might be even
[SPEAKER_01]: more interested in, I was really quite
surprised to find that in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, they're way ahead of the
vegetable industry in testing the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemical abundance in their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to see the day when
tomatoes would come with the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: labels that are now common in states where
cannabis has been legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some challenges right now
around the testing methodologies and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much we can trust these tests from the
various labs that we're getting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would imagine, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least the testing protocols are
there and there's requirements around
[SPEAKER_00]: testing that I think are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seems like there's consumer
interest in knowing things like the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of what are the active ingredients in
the phytochemicals that affect the nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas for tomatoes, there's no such
information available to consumers at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet it relates directly to flavor and
healthfulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as someone who has an edible nursery
and sells produce, we carry a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants of a particular type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all these different tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you read about a description of
tomato, you may hear that this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: one is higher in phytonutrients,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll grow it, but we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not actually testing that tomato to
see if these claims are true or what
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of differences there may act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be so minor that it's not even
worth mentioning, but we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or how much how you grow it affects
the expression of those phytochemicals and
[SPEAKER_01]: phytonutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something where I think that
you were talking about the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at the one level, there'll be
more consumer interest in understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: what is in things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think there will be
opportunities to explore the degree to
[SPEAKER_01]: which the style of growing actually
affects the expression of phytonutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to just the hard baked genetics
in different varieties of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could think of them as sort of two
different dimensions that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: explored agronomically.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the crop breeding to manipulate the
genetics and the basic practices of how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you treat the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you fertilizing it with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you disturbing the ground surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you returning the crop residue from
the same plant to the same fields?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have other plants growing along in
the same soil over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kind of things are sort of this
whole other dimension to explore in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of the phytochemical and phytonutrient
expression in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you wrote Growing a Revolution,
you got to travel around and visit a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these farms, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, can you touch on a little bit of
some of the different practices that you
[SPEAKER_00]: saw?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the good, the bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really was what was really working
out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what Anne will talk to you about
in talking about the hidden half of nature
[SPEAKER_01]: is how she restored the soil and its
fertility in our yard with her gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and her mulching and her
composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was watching this after writing the
dirt book about how ancient societies had
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed and degraded their land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Anne was turning that whole story
around on its head right in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me a while to clue in and
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took her a while to notice the
changes, but they happened really
[SPEAKER_01]: remarkably fast, as I'm sure you guys will
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I came away from that experience
wondering, OK, to what degree could
[SPEAKER_01]: similar kinds of practices bring the
fertility of our cropland or agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: soils back?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be done at scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you do it on big farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you do it on little farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took six months off from teaching at
the University of Washington, where I
[SPEAKER_01]: work, and visited farms around the world
that had adopted practices to prioritize
[SPEAKER_01]: rebuilding the health of their soil and
thereby the fertility of their land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to farms in the Dakotas,
North and South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Costa Rica and Equatorial West
Africa and looked at farms that ranged
[SPEAKER_01]: from 20,000 acres in size to really big
industrialized farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Dakotas, and then also really small
subsistence farms in Costa Rica and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I came away with was the
realization that there's a simple set of
[SPEAKER_01]: principles, fairly high level agronomic
principles, that if adopted altogether as
[SPEAKER_01]: a system, really are a recipe for
cultivating the kinds of beneficial soil
[SPEAKER_01]: life that Anne will tell you all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she's the biologist in our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, the geologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a set of agronomic practices
that really cultivate that beneficial life
[SPEAKER_01]: that are pretty simple conceptually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's minimize the disturbance of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always keep the ground covered with
cover crops or some living plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bare soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't farm naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always keep the ground covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third principle being grow a
diversity of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just grow one or two crops in the
same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because over time, that is an invitation
for pests and pathogens to take root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either grow a diversity of crops around
your cash crop or in a rotation in between
[SPEAKER_01]: your cash crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those three simple principles were the
common elements that every farmer I
[SPEAKER_01]: visited that had restored, remarkably
turned their soil around within a decade
[SPEAKER_01]: or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd all adopted practices that were
faithful to those principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the practices they had in different
parts of the world, they were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guys in Ghana were not doing the
same things as the people in Costa Rica or
[SPEAKER_01]: the people in the Dakotas or Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: They each had their own specific style of
practices to minimize disturbance and to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the ground covered and to get a
diversity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those 40,000 foot high level
principles were honored across the board
[SPEAKER_01]: in those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had exhibited remarkable
transformations over what a geologist
[SPEAKER_01]: considers to be a really short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really impressed with how fast a
different style of thinking about the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: is the foundation for agriculture,
but how big a difference that could make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it scales from, you know, our yard in
North Seattle to these 20,000 acre farms
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Dakotas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all kinds of side benefits
that come with it in terms of reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer use, reduced pesticide use,
reduced diesel use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at sort of modern,
big scale commodity crop production farms
[SPEAKER_01]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, those are the key expensive
items on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can cut those expenses and keep
the yields up, it's a recipe for a more
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I turned into an optimist
on this stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that sense, as a geologist,
can you go into a little bit more why it
[SPEAKER_00]: is important to not disturb the soil and
why it's important to cover the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those two, especially from a
geological perspective, are really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you, if you go out into the
woods somewhere and you dig a hole and you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the profile of the soil,
so you like clean off face off and just
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the wall of the hole that you dug
and look at the nature of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's generally a lot of organic matter
on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farther down you go, you get more
mineral matter, more broken up rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think of what makes soil
fertile, it's that marriage of geology and
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, the mixing of the dead parts of
rock with the living stuff of live
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms or the once living organic
matter, you know, rotting leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: animal carcasses, the whole sort of,
all the stuff that plants and animals rot
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that combination of organic matter
and mineral matter that makes healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most, the lion's share of
fertility in the soil is in that surface
[SPEAKER_01]: layer, the topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only about six to 12 inches thick
in most places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fairly thin and fragile layer on
the surface of the earth before you get
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the subsoil, which has far less
fertility, and then get down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bedrock, which, you know, it's hard to
grow plants just on bedrock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants can do it, but those tend to
be pioneers, not the ones we grow for
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about soil as a fairly
thin and fragile layer that coats the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of the earth, that is the
recycling engine for turning all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that are held in living
organisms, plants and animals,
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the raw materials to feed the
next generation of living organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: through the way plants take the stuff up
through the roots and then herbivores eat
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and carnivores eat the
herbivores and the whole circle of life
[SPEAKER_01]: goes round and round again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is a pretty fundamental resource when
you think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the big, the great history of
humanity for the last 10,000 years is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been mining soil fertility to feed
ourselves in regions around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we have a global civilization
where regional food shortages translate
[SPEAKER_01]: into global crises, whether through
refugees or economic crises, and the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: of some of the big modern conflicts around
the world can be traced to land
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation and conflict over land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at the Middle East today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is going to become an increasingly
important touchstone and resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity through this century because of
its very fundamental nature to maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomic productivity and production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've rambled enough that I forgot
where your question was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was looking at a, no, I found that
really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think it's very interesting
how, when you look at culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an anthropology major at the
University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my alma mater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it from a cultural
perspective, but if we look at how soil
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced culture and how, and how,
you know, societies, grew up based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the fertility of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, agriculture was sort of what
allowed us to make that next evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: step in a lot of ways from a cultural
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we can talk about that for,
you know, there's, there's whole courses
[SPEAKER_00]: on just that topic.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the sort of the first,
I like to think of us having gone through
[SPEAKER_01]: four major agricultural revolutions so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one was just thinking about
doing agriculture in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, it was a radical act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the dirt book, I talk about the
early origin of agriculture in the Middle
[SPEAKER_01]: East and how it was a process that was in
many ways driven by desperation due to
[SPEAKER_01]: climate, due to climate shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming out of the last ice age,
there was a cold snap that the climate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Middle East snapped back to full on
glacial for about a thousand years at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time when the, the hunter and gatherers in
that region had come to rely on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and animals of the warming,
the then warming climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden they're back to
full glacial conditions and their food
[SPEAKER_01]: sources disappeared except for grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we started cultivating
grains like the proto emers and wheats and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that there was a big problem in
terms of feeding oneself with in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shrinking, shrinking resource space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once people started intentionally
collecting and hybrid and hybridizing and
[SPEAKER_01]: planting seeds, they got pretty good at
growing food and their population was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow and increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gotten better and better and
better at having fewer and fewer people
[SPEAKER_01]: grow more and more food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that today, instead of, you know,
99% of us being farmers in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, 1% of us are farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of totally flipped the ratios
in terms of who's feeding how many people
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course of agricultural history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that of course lets people like me,
you know, be things like professors at
[SPEAKER_01]: universities because I'm, I don't have to
be out working in the field all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a major first step on the road to
civilization was agriculture and the
[SPEAKER_01]: audacious act of planting and tending our
food sources as opposed to just gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: them from, you know, keen observational
experience in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that the second
agricultural revolution was when we
[SPEAKER_01]: learned how to do things like plant
legumes and crop rotations and rotate our
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, maneuver the field, things that
boost, help to boost soil fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: through acts of soil husbandry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were identified, you know,
by societies around the world and they
[SPEAKER_01]: became traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice that two of those three
principles I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, keeping the ground covered with
cover crops and having a diverse rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are old ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not new ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Societies around the world adopted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's brand new is taking those old ideas
of soil husbandry and coupling them with
[SPEAKER_01]: things like no-till farming that allows us
to farm without the plow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because if you plow
the surface of the earth and you invert
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, you turn it over, it leaves it
bare and vulnerable to erosion by wind or
[SPEAKER_01]: rain until the next crop comes in or weeds
take over your field, whatever comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: next.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a good rainstorm when the
ground is bare, you get that phenomenon
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that we've all seen of like
runoff off a construction site where
[SPEAKER_01]: they've stripped off the vegetation,
you got bare earth, you get rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got muddy water running off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's fertility just going right
down the drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the story of farming in many
ancient societies that relied on the plow
[SPEAKER_01]: for weed control and preparing their seed
beds is that over the generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: they literally lost their topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third agricultural
revolution, to go back to that thread,
[SPEAKER_01]: was mechanization and the use of chemical
fertilizers in the 19th and 20th
[SPEAKER_01]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 20th century, we then got on to
sort of the biotechnology revolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fourth revolution, looking at the
so-called green revolution and the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of GMO crops and so forth in
the agro-tech business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're poised now for actually
a fifth agricultural revolution that's
[SPEAKER_01]: built on identifying practices that build
the health of the soil as the foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: for a sustainable agriculture,
not to abandon modern technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to essentially integrate the best of
modern technology with the best of ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: wisdom and soil husbandry in a new system
of farming that honors those three
[SPEAKER_01]: principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I kind of ended up in the
Growing a Revolution book is that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got an opportunity to rethink how we look
at the soil in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a huge opportunity for humanity
this century to try and get it right this
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say to people on the
other side of the coin that may be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the future of agriculture from the
perspective of hydroponics and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions that are specifically created
for crops, and in many cases, GMO crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving further and further away from
organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's sort of a big debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anne and I are starting to gather data and
to look at some of those issues for the
[SPEAKER_01]: new book that we're starting to work on on
relating soil health to human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything I say will be provisional
until we dive in and sort out as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But based on the work we've done in
previous books, you've got to wonder about
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're growing plants in a non-soil
medium, you're growing them either really
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponically or in a medium that's not
really soil where you just have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sand or coconut fiber or some substrate
that's there to hold the roots up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're adding everything to the mix to
grow your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you missing in terms of the
interaction of that plant with the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the root system of that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Anne, I'm sure tell you a lot more
about the exudates the plants push out
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil and the things the microbes
make from them that the plants take back
[SPEAKER_01]: up that shapes the phytochemical abundance
and profile in the plants and their
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral micronutrient concentrations,
their nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what we know enough about the
relationship of plants to their
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome, their microbiology that
surrounds them in the soil to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's connections between the state of
the soil and what's getting into plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you then remove soil from the
equation or you remove that life from the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation and you just say add zinc or
copper or whatever micronutrients you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to add and just the right proportions for
your crop, how much are they taking up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How important was the role of soil life in
actually getting the plants to absorb
[SPEAKER_01]: those nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's questions there in terms of
what the basic effects are, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the problem of say like growing
lettuce in a city and you look at it from
[SPEAKER_01]: an energetic perspective, if you're not
growing that plant in a soil where the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology is doing a lot of the work of
nutrient acquisition, provisioning and
[SPEAKER_01]: transport for you, then you've got to
acquire those nutrients from somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else and bring them to your hydroponic
system and add them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may not be energetically
efficient for all nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beautiful thing about a soil,
it is grabbing a lot of those nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the life in the soil is grabbing a lot of
the micronutrients out of the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: particles and recycling or organic matter
and that's a whole different game than if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just adding a little chemical A,
a little chemical B into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, on the flip side of looking at
hydroponics, I think there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting opportunities for thinking
about microbial amendments and microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants, both for plants grown in the
soil and also and probably especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are grown hydroponically
because without a soil, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be depopulate in terms of their own
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd want to have some kind of a
compost tea or microbial amendments and my
[SPEAKER_01]: suspicion is that there's an awful lot yet
to be learned about how to dial those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of systems in for either optimal
growing or optimal phytochemical and
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient profiles of various crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of in the early days of
understanding how those microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: communities affect plants and a lot of
what the people in the wine business refer
[SPEAKER_01]: to as terroir, a lot of that is probably
shaped and influenced by the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in the soil, on the skin of
the grapes that get involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to still be learned about
how it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it feels almost arrogant to think
that we can create a nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: that can match what nature does in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even know half the species in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that we can match it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the real question is, the real
arrogance is that we could do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we can grow a plant completely
hydroponically and completely control that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been established and well accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we can't prove is that that
plant is going to offer us the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional benefits that we would be
getting from a plant that was grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: well-made soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of thing Anne and I are
starting to poke our noses into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how far we can get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fascinating area because we now
know enough about the science to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some very legitimate questions
like you're asking to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably not as much data as
anybody would like to have to answer those
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which makes for an interesting challenge
in terms of triangulation of what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective and data can we bring in from
different kinds of studies to develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: mature understanding of those connections
so that people could make decisions about
[SPEAKER_01]: where they want their food to be grown,
how they want their wine to be grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they want their weed to be grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the coming decade or two,
we'll see a lot more people asking
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your comment reminded me of a book I've
been reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's by Adam Price.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, he talks in the book
about some of the microbial interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: that go on around alcohol and how some of
these distilleries, these famous whiskey
[SPEAKER_00]: distilleries, have tried to recreate their
building, their whole infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: half a mile away from their original
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't make the same whiskey
because they can't get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial...
[SPEAKER_00]: Even that microclimate of microbial life
has that much effect on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they believe that the special yeast are
living in the roof of their building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they built another roof on top of their
roof when that roof started to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fascinating to me how these
microbes influence our behavior and
[SPEAKER_00]: influence our crops and influence our
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Anne is really the one to speak
to on a lot of the microbial stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you just made me think of that as we
were chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just becoming aware of the
magnitude of those impacts and the
[SPEAKER_01]: influence of not the kind of ideas of,
you know, there's like a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: disease organism that causes a particular
disease, the whole germ theory thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how the community of microbes for a
lot of these beneficial effects that
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about how long it took
us to actually understand the community
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology of the nature we can see with our
own senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it took us a hundred years to
figure out that taking the wolves out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Yellowstone caused the elk to overgraze
the riparian zones, which changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: river morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you wanted to restore the river,
you had to bring wolves back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it took us a hundred years to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see all the animals and the
plants and how they interact and how the
[SPEAKER_01]: water flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just imagine how complicated it is to
understand that microbial community
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology when we can't even see the damn
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone listening to this podcast,
who's cultivating cannabis, they may say,
[SPEAKER_00]: who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not eating the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of them are, but in general
it's being, you know, combusted or heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutritional aspects of the cannabis
is probably less important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does this data and why do your
books matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm putting you on the spot here
from the, from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't mind being put on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that one of the connections there,
you know, if you're not relying on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a mainstay of your diet,
which, you know, I do not recommend,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're then I can say, let's see how
you're worrying about say the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient profile is not going to be
your biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at things like the various
terpene profiles, the balance of CBDs and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in cannabis, these are things that I
think that most growers probably think
[SPEAKER_01]: that the biggest influence on those things
lies in the genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's been, you know,
people breeding cannabis back since I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in high school in Northern California that
have been playing with how to influence
[SPEAKER_01]: the expression of characteristics in that
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole microbiome connection in the
soil is another dimension to what could
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the terpene profiles, phytochemical
abundance, which could translate into
[SPEAKER_01]: either the relative medicinal versus
psychoactive effects in cases of THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBDs, or even more so I think in terms of
the flavor profile and sort of the nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the psychoactive effects, whether
you've got something like myrcine,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of myrcine or limonene is going to
affect both flavor and effect in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things, the relative magnitude
of phytochemicals are things that should
[SPEAKER_01]: be influenced by agronomic practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the style of hydroponic
growing, outdoor soil, sun grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should see differences in the
expression of phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to those kinds of practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as for your listener who may be a
grower, I guess what I would suggest is
[SPEAKER_01]: that if they're thinking about the sort of
the genetic palette that they have to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with all the crosses and strains and
whatever that they have in their
[SPEAKER_01]: repertoire, shall we say, the style of
growing is another dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a different access in terms
of how to influence the expression and
[SPEAKER_01]: character of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of room to
experiment with that that probably hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: received as much attention in terms of the
outcome as the science that Anna and I are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with sort of would suggest that
it might warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really important
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I have some, I'll have to put you
in touch with a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just got some really amazing results
down in phantom farms in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene numbers being so much higher than
what you're normally seeing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing using living soils and these
organic practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really important aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I think Anna and I
would predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd love to communicate with that
person and get them and if they're willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to share their data, because we're in the
new book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have chapters on grains,
vegetables, wine, grapes and cannabis as
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a wide range of agronomic
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So assuming that the listener to this
podcast just doesn't care about the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, doesn't care about
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think this is the case,
but even barring those thoughts and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't care about organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you see when you were writing
Growing Revolution in terms of pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease suppression and some of these
practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's really good examples now in
nature of studies that have looked at the
[SPEAKER_01]: connection between a healthy living soil
in the sense of an organic matter rich
[SPEAKER_01]: soil with a whole bunch of microorganisms
in it, which is sort of what healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil is shorthand for.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of examples where
the defense, the interactions between that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiota in the soil and the plants sort
of mediated through what's going out of
[SPEAKER_01]: and back into their roots influence
essentially the defense system of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a crop that is sort of
over fertilized and growing in relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile soil, then you've essentially
dismantled its defensive system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in great part manifest in its
relationship with the soil microbiome that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes chemical compounds that the plant
can take up and use for its defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of complicated interactions
and synergies there that Anne can probably
[SPEAKER_01]: talk with you about at length and on the
hidden half, because that's at the heart
[SPEAKER_01]: of that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key thing is that if you have
plants growing in a life rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: fertile soil, they're going to be more
robust and both pest and disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are experiments that go back 100
years in botany, back to Hiltner back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1910s, I think it was, where if you
try and grow plants in a sterile medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very susceptible to pests and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow them in an organic matter rich
soil full of bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pests and pathogens can't really get a
seat at the table to attack the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get out competed by all the less
damaging or even more beneficial organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: that thrive in the root zone around
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that in terms of net
expenditures on fertilizer, net
[SPEAKER_01]: expenditures on pesticides, what I found
in conventional agriculture was that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers who had adopted practices rooted
around those three principles I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about earlier, they were able to reduce,
to so reduce their input costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: their need for pesticides, their need for
fertilizers, that it saved them a boatload
[SPEAKER_01]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is something I might have
mentioned in previous podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it made me think of it is,
I don't know if you're familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: giant pumpkin community, but these guys-
I'm sorry, the what community?
[SPEAKER_00]: The giant pumpkin community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are as passionate as
cannabis growers about their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow from seed to fruit, trying to
get the largest pumpkin they can in a
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're up, I think, over 2,600 pounds
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially, Yeah, initially they were
sort of stalling out right around 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by a combination, and they were
doing it mainly conventionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're using all your traditional
conventional things and just pumping these
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins full of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were getting split stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were having other issues and rot to
where the pumpkins weren't making it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the weigh-ins, or they stalled out on
their growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started using organic
practices again, like mycorrhizal fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a compost combination of improving
genetics and these practices, this hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: approach of feeding small amounts of
chemical nutrients in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic practices and building their soil
has allowed them to reach these new- they
[SPEAKER_00]: never thought they'd break the 2,000 pound
barrier even five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's a lot of the
future of agriculture is maybe we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to throw all chemical nutrients and
traditional agriculture away, but find
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to incorporate it back into our
organic practices in microdoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sort of the happy hybrid kind of a
way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blissfully unaware of the giant
pumpkin community, but that sounds like a
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting story I might be
interested in digging more into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a number of the farmers I interviewed
in Growing a Revolution are working with
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional farmers who had so reduced
their input use based on improving the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility of their soil that I started
teasing them that they were organic-ish
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had better yields than their
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had much lower expenses than their
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to me to be a really positive
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not fully organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had basically done what you just
described of trying to take some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best features of organic agriculture and
reserving the ability or the right,
[SPEAKER_01]: as some of them put it, to use other
means, some of the chemicals that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: come to rely on when they thought they
really needed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the more they improved their soil,
they found the less they needed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were happy not to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reliance on petrochemicals too is
obviously a global issue and global
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of motivation there to
move away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk a little bit more then
about this idea of organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you went around, are you seeing this
as sort of, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: this next revolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really think this is the future of
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think, as speculation of
society, are we going to hit a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional agriculture just no longer
functions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we go, there's a report that
came out in 2015 from the United Nations
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Global State of the Soil
Report, assessment I think it was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically maintained in that
report that we're losing about 0.3% of our
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomic production capacity globally
each and every year due to ongoing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation and loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 0.3% is kind of a small number unless
you think out over the next 50 or 100
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's another 15 to 30% of global
agricultural capacity reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we maintain farming practices that
continue to degrade the land that we
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on to grow our food, we're going to
get in trouble then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the story of ancient societies that
I laid out in the dirt book.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm really happy about is that a lot
of these soil building practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they were adopted more widely,
could reverse that and turn it around in
[SPEAKER_01]: shockingly short order in the way that a
geologist thinks about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could actually turn it around this
century.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could pull it out of the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would require thinking differently
about how we farm on our conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: cropland.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's a lot of opportunity
and opportunities to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether we'll do it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some fairly large and obvious
interests that would prefer we maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: what we now call conventional agriculture
because there's some very profitable
[SPEAKER_01]: industries that are built up around that
that aren't necessarily on farm but are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in selling farmers things and
buying things from farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the big, I think, big
environmental issues of our time that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't get anywhere near the attention
that it deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see the downside of trying to
restore health and fertility to the
[SPEAKER_01]: world's farmland soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our great-grandchildren are going to need
that soil in good shape to make their
[SPEAKER_01]: living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we can do it profitably,
we should pursue that and take whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: turnover there is in terms of its impact
on certain industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're losing soil, too,
as our population expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asphalted more and more of it every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and those things are working in the
wrong direction against each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got to figure out how to
strike a balance, I think, between what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've considered to be conventional
agriculture and organic agriculture in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of trying to make more of
conventional agriculture this style of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic-ish agriculture that I think I
argue for in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also got to sort of think about
how are we going to grow food in cities
[SPEAKER_01]: near where people are as more and more of
us are in cities?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we grow all our other crops as
well, from wine to cannabis to the fibers
[SPEAKER_01]: that we wear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not anything we're going to be
able to solve overnight, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to know that there's people
out there writing books about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging people to all these things
like regenerative agricultural practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing things locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a garden at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a garden at my house.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that people get in and
learn where their food comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that can't be emphasized
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we all improve the soil in our
daily lives, whether it's in our garden or
[SPEAKER_01]: on our farm, if everybody got into doing
that, there's a shocking amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be parked in the ground in ways
that benefit the expression of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemicals and micronutrients in our
crops that just benefit the fertility of
[SPEAKER_01]: the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things where if
everybody could do their own little piece
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own little corner of the world,
it would add up to a lot if enough people
[SPEAKER_01]: did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought up something that I had wanted
to ask you about a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last topic I would have is when I
was talking about not less disturbance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, I was really looking at it from
a carbon perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain for listeners briefly the
importance of carbon and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about that cycle and why it's such an
emphasis in regenerative agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about how carbon works
between the sky and the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are the middlemen because plants,
through photosynthesis, grab carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide out of the atmosphere and combine
it with water that they pull up through
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots to make carbohydrates,
sugars, the building blocks of their
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they give off oxygen in the process,
which is good for us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in building their bodies, they're
grabbing carbon out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then once it's in a plant's body,
it sits there over the life of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: unless that plant pushes some of that
carbon out of its roots into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants will push 30, 40 percent of
the carbon they capture from the sky out
[SPEAKER_01]: through their roots into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do it in the form of sugars and
proteins and things we might think of as
[SPEAKER_01]: food because they're feeding microbes in
the soil that do things in return for them
[SPEAKER_01]: that Anne will talk with you a lot about,
but that basically when those microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil die, their bodies are rich in
carbon and in nitrogen and in phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the other micronutrients that form
living things that form the constituents
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bodies of plants and microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once that once living material that
becomes dead, it's then organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic matter, the carbon rich
compounds that were once living,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's food for microorganisms that break
that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly, saprophytic fungi,
things that eat dead things, they break
[SPEAKER_01]: down that once living organic matter and
reduce it to sort of its elemental
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tend to transform it into forms that
can be taken back up by the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think of it as a full cycle
where living organisms are decay and
[SPEAKER_01]: recycled into the ingredients that are
used to build the next generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: living things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the recycling function in the soil
wasn't working, it wouldn't take all that
[SPEAKER_01]: long for this world to be buried under
dead things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nothing broke down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing that system works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, I've forgotten where you
started with on the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need carbon in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think of carbon as the fuel
that's feeding the microbes that's helping
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive the back half of the circle of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is helping to get mineral
micronutrients out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can you can literally think of sort
of the organic matter content or the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon content because, you know,
organic matter is roughly half carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more organic matter, the more
carbon, the more carbon, the more organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally think of that carbon
content of the soil as sort of a measure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the biological batteries that are in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lot of organic matter and a
lot of life in the soil, the cycling of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and nutrition and the and the
acquisition from fresh mineral particles
[SPEAKER_01]: will just be running faster because that
sort of the Easter, what the ever ready
[SPEAKER_01]: bunny of the soil is just going to be
working much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you run out of organic matter,
you're just drawn down that battery and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been hitting the drum slower and
slower and slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why biochar or terra preta from
back in the Amazon rainforest was so
[SPEAKER_00]: effective as a way of improving soil
fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what biochar is, is if you take
organic matter and you combust it in a low
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen environment, it becomes charcoal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the volatiles are driven off
of it in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what temperature you make
it at and what you're making out of in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place, there can be elements in it
that microbes can scavenge for food in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to just the raw carbon matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the real things that I think
the biochar does in the soil isn't so much
[SPEAKER_01]: the direct fertility boost from it,
but it's that it increases the water
[SPEAKER_01]: holding capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charcoal is really good at holding water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to think of it as, as habitat
for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the farmers that I visited in
Central America, for example, down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Costa Rica were using biochar to restore
fertility to their land, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the biochar and then inoculating it
with a compost tea that they made from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi that they would get from
the native forest from out in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you basically think of biochar as
habitat for organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were populating that habitat with,
with fungi and bacteria out of the native
[SPEAKER_01]: forest, mixing with their biochar,
then integrating that into their fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're essentially cultivating the
beneficial life in the soil to help break
[SPEAKER_01]: down the organic matter that they would
leave on their fields and feed their next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to keep this, I feel like we could
talk on these topics forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else though that you
want to cover before we sign off in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to your books or some of the
history of soil and how it might relate to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one, one thing,
if you think about how to restore soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I haven't really seen anybody write or
talk much about, about this next point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll just bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it crossed my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about how it is that you
would sort of boost the organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: content of the soil, what you want to get
is organic biomass and fiber into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a parallel with the human gut
that Ann will talk to you about with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the hidden half of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, you know, but hemp is one of
the great crops for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we used to make rope out of it
after all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we're thinking about,
you know, cover crops to, to boost the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter content and fertility of
soils, getting hemp into crop rotations,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then using, you know, some of that
biomass as microbe food in soils is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: My initial thought on that, my one concern
would be that your, the species may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too closely related and you may end
up with pest problems, but I don't know of
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone that's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if you put it in corn fields and
put it in soybean fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was thinking of it as a rotation
with a cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what I would, you know, my,
my recommendation, I haven't thought that
[SPEAKER_01]: that deeply about cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't have any experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a brown thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kill any plant you give me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ann is the guard, Ann is the gardener in
our household.
[SPEAKER_01]: She may give you better advice,
but in terms of getting diversity into
[SPEAKER_01]: rotations of cannabis, I'd encourage
farmers to think about, if you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, think about planting other plants
in between your crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave the ground bare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it look manicured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intentionally plant what you might
otherwise call weeds, pardon the pun,
[SPEAKER_01]: in between your cash crop in ways that
would you think of as green manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, for indoor operations,
I mean, maybe you grow a low rise crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil around the cash crop,
get diversity, into the soils by having
[SPEAKER_01]: mixes of low rise crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the, in terms of the pest
resistance and disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might be well worth experimenting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people running cover crops
with their cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's, that's becoming more and more
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally, that's already been thought
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis farmers are very good at
experimenting and trying new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely on the cutting edge in
that regard, which is, which is why it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I personally on indoor
facilities haven't seen a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that off on scale successfully,
but I know there are people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry about it as a habitat for pests
and disease, cause we do have such a
[SPEAKER_00]: monocropping culture and we don't have,
we don't have that diversity of insect
[SPEAKER_00]: life that we have outdoors because it is
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pest may make it in, but that
predator and other diversity may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't people actually like,
you know, release predators inside their
[SPEAKER_01]: operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have a lot of people doing
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple podcasts on that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another, I think that's the
future of agriculture in a lot of ways as
[SPEAKER_00]: we move away from pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the examples I've seen on sort of
conventional farms that have gone to
[SPEAKER_01]: biological pest management have been very
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy named Jonathan Lundgren at
Blue Dasher Farms in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of your listeners or want to follow
up on this stuff, go to his website and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out what he's been doing and the
research he's been doing on alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: means of pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but if people are interested in
our books and we've got the Dirt,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Erosion of Civilizations book that I
wrote, the Hidden Half of Nature that Anne
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wrote, and then Growing a
Revolution, the new book about
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, you know, they're available at any
bookstore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a website that is dig2grow.com,
digthenumber2grow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're active on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at digthenumber2grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people can reach us via our
website if they're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously we recommend the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing a Revolution was a finalist for
the E.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilson Literary Science Writing Prize this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, they've been getting good
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staring at my autographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have copy right now and the Hidden Half
of Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got on Audible so I can listen to it as
an audio book when I'm driving around and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely, I definitely
recommend the books and I will put all the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources up on the podcast page for
listeners after the podcast goes live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So David, I really appreciate you taking
the time today to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're over there teaching at,
well, my favorite school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish you the best and thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was David Montgomery, geologist,
professor, and author of numerous books,
