[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon is a second generation cannabis
cultivator with over 35 years of direct
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building on fundamentals learned as a
child, Brandon has applied a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to cannabis cultivation,
starting with his first plants his
[SPEAKER_01]: freshman year of college in 1986.
[SPEAKER_01]: He currently works for KISS Organics,
providing growers with everything from
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to assistance with
nutrients and soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: A well-rounded and passionate organic
grower, Brandon's real passion is in soil
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most recently, Brandon was the director of
cultivation and one of four founding
[SPEAKER_01]: members of a minority-owned hemp flower
farm in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: He provided SOPs and oversight for all
aspects of cultivation from propagation to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and cure, including daily
operation of a large nursery facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this role, Brandon also performed
several federally funded hemp trials for
[SPEAKER_01]: HBCUs as well as research projects for
nutrient producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a proud dad and husband who spends
his free time outdoors with his veggie
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens and chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week's show is a bit different as we
get a lot of the same questions at KISS
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics and thought it would be fun to do
a show covering a lot of the most common
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Brandon, thanks for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I know we talk all the time,
but I want to do this show kind of talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about all the questions that you get asked
on a daily basis, you know, helping out
[SPEAKER_01]: with the phones and doing a lot of the
agronomy and soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just start off right off the bat
talking about soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get asked a lot about how to reuse the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of take me through sort of what that
process looks like with KISS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it really, you know, it's like
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a little bit of background on
their cultivation practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after we get information about,
you know, how their growth setup is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all kind of similar or the same
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether they're in pots or in large
beds, which we prefer for various reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're approaching the end of around
three weeks, two weeks, it really depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on how organized they are and how quickly
they can, you know, get things turned
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the usual suspect list of
amendments that they'll most likely need
[SPEAKER_00]: on hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, they're not waiting to,
you know, get their test results and then
[SPEAKER_00]: order amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can usually, you know, about two
weeks out, take a soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in beds, they could take a
couple of samples from each bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix those together homogenously,
send off two cups to Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in pots, they can either dump
all that soil, mix it together thoroughly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of my preference,
but that's a lot of labor to get that back
[SPEAKER_00]: into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can take samples from,
you know, representative pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that again, again, send that off to
Logan Labs and get their soil reports
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're armed to do the mineral
nutrition side of their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get that soil report back and
we'll send them a detailed recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: of what amendments they need to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it as far as the
mineral side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're doing it, you know,
and you and I talked about this the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day, how incredible it is that we can use
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm a big fan of the soil reports
and getting those amendments in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the biological side of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the physical
components of the soil that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical components, you know,
we're mostly worried about compaction over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of rounds, we've got the
organic matter breaking down and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to compact a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every couple of rounds,
for me, it comes down to every four
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds, but everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll I'll add, you know,
maybe six to eight percent aggregate back
[SPEAKER_00]: into my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just escaped the East Coast,
the swamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say on the East Coast,
it's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're ordering from the West Coast
to get pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of folks, I recommend lava
rock, even hydrogen, hydroten,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to get some aggregate back in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is not a good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite, I used it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eventually going to all float to the
top and end up in the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just going to lose all of your
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just not a really good choice for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to deal with the
biological side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all about quality compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's, you know, when people are
making their own soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast folks that can't afford
shipping who, you know, want to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pack from KISS to get balanced
nutrients, mineral nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their their Achilles heel is always trying
to find good compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get a compost, not all
compost are created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a short little checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know the pH of that compost
just to make sure it's not way out of
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon to nitrogen ratio, obviously,
if it's above 18 to one, I would I would
[SPEAKER_00]: find a different compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the carbon to nitrogen ratio,
heavy metals, those are the real blockers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to look at sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at the cations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they have a suitable compost,
every couple of rounds, you can add that
[SPEAKER_00]: or alternatively, you can be getting your
biology through teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, there's there's some
options to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every couple of rounds, I do like to
get some more compost back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so just to highlight a few things
and add a little bit, there's three main
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we're looking at when we're
re-amending soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to look at the physical properties
of the soil, which is gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration, moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're if you're buying
potting soil, that should already be
[SPEAKER_01]: optimized or close enough to optimize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a matter of maintaining it
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the biological properties of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're on the West Coast,
I'm going to give a shout out to New
[SPEAKER_01]: England Compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen samples of it and talked to them
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have a really nice product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out there, check in with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to bring in compost
to add organic matter because of the risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of fungus gnats or other pests,
things like that, you could look into
[SPEAKER_01]: making a compost tea or a compost extract
as a way of getting beneficial microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could use a specific microbial
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some options there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we talk about the mineral
side, which is where we really like to
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasize and target for re-amendment,
two to three weeks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be kind of a little close with
a few facilities if they're further away
[SPEAKER_01]: and they need to get amendment ordered
after seeing the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you already have all the amendments
on hand and they're doing this all
[SPEAKER_01]: internally, then two weeks worth is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things I want to point out
with this is it's important to always take
[SPEAKER_01]: the samples the same way and take them
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do one sample for an entire room
if you're treating the room homogenously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have any outlier beds that
are performing differently for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, you can always sample those
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't need to sample every bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, Mason, soil doctor and I have had
multiple conversations about this and the
[SPEAKER_01]: tests always come back close enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it saves a lot of money, you know,
being able to test per room or per area
[SPEAKER_01]: versus every bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thing around the
testing, just to mention to folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did partner with Logan Labs and now we
are offering the testing directly through
[SPEAKER_01]: KISS for those of you that work with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do an analysis for $35 at the
complete soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you buy the amendments that we
recommend through us and get a credit
[SPEAKER_01]: towards those amendments, so essentially
making the consult portion free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an option for folks that do use
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I don't want to focus too much
on KISS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep this podcast educational
and not as sales pitchy as possible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand agnostic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say one other thing
about soil that gets left out once you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the mineral, physical and
biological is the IPM side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it is really important to keep
that soil healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk about folks that have to
flush between rounds because their sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really important once
you've removed those plants, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the immune system of the of the
soil to get something aggressive,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's trichoderma or
lactobacillus, but some productive biology
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, like we, you know,
I'm always saying that we've probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium on our faces when we're talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to exclude
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some things that you can add
into your soil to outcompete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the the insect side of
things where you could be putting gopheria
[SPEAKER_00]: and beneficial insects like SF nematodes
or, you know, other insects in to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats, whatever pest pressures you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's one last piece of
that puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I like to just at least start the
conversation with folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, since you brought up flushing,
a couple of things I want to mention
[SPEAKER_01]: around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we typically don't recommend flushing
in organic soils unless you have an excess
[SPEAKER_01]: of nitrates or mineral nutrition in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the prior to harvest now after
harvest, if you have excessive levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrates, potassium, or more specifically,
sodium, which we do see when you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any runoff potentially build up over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an essential plant plant mineral,
and it can cause issues and raise your
[SPEAKER_01]: overall soluble salt level.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say flush, but then they have
questions about how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take us through what the flushing
process would look like to reduce sodium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's one that
we just see repeatedly with this style of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium is highly mobile, but with no
runoff, there's no place for it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to do is if your sodium is
creeping up, you know, any time I see
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody hit 100 ppms, I start talking to
them about, you know, let's let's play in
[SPEAKER_00]: for a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen some pretty scary numbers,
three hundred and forty four parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like you mentioned, the overall
soluble salts and related osmotic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to go up exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sodium is going to block your
productive cations, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can actually replace potassium in
the plant, which is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to flush that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to do that, first and
foremost, is to make sure that your water
[SPEAKER_00]: is not bringing in extra sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if sodium, if the contamination is
coming from your water, obviously you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to solve that before you do a flush,
because pumping more sodium laden water
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bed is not going to fix the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have clean water, low sodium,
you want to flush approximately 10 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so a four by four is typically,
you know, with a 12 inch side,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 inches of soil is almost dead on 100
gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you flush that 10 percent,
you want to get 10 gallons of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most facilities are not set up with
this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you don't have a way
to capture your runoff, if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a valve you can open on the bottom of your
bed or something like that, you'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little more creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, you know, some growers who will
catch it in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they've got two of those full,
they know they've got 10 gallons out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we're growers,
we're resourceful and we'll figure out a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to get 10 percent runoff
through that bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To essentially cut that sodium or that
nitrate in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically what we're shooting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring in an EC meter and,
you know, take your EC right when runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll typically be very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could continue to flush until
that EC is cut in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will give you a more dialed in
approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have really good success with just
the 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's normally what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last little bit, I try to
that's where I'll add trichoderma or
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus just to make sure that I'm
getting a really nice biology prophylactic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to keeping that soil safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we don't like to do this type of
heavy flushing when there's a plant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give people some numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a yard of soil,
it's approximately 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting 20 gallons of water through
it coming out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might take more than it might take
30 or 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just really depends on how dry their
soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so the the runoff target,
you want to collect that 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can, you know, so it might
take more water than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 gallons in a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take 15 or 20 to get get 10
gallons to flow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what their target is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you mentioned Bavaria changing
topics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to bounce around a lot with
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to talk about some things
that we learned about Bavaria last week in
[SPEAKER_01]: a meeting with one of the large major
producers of it in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to just share a little bit of
that, but I do hope to do a whole podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: just on Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the highlights from that
meeting that I want to share was that
[SPEAKER_01]: every species is different and will have
slightly different results within that
[SPEAKER_01]: target class of pests that Bavaria works
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the particular theory of
Bavaria that, you know, is sold through
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioworks is going to have different
results than the one from Certis and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on and on down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not to say that one is better
than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that they're just going to have
slightly different results across the
[SPEAKER_01]: species that Bavaria works with because
they're all different strains and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were all captured naturally from different
areas around the world, which also means
[SPEAKER_01]: that they'll have different storage
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some may store in the fridge for six
months and not have any any spore loss,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas others won't have that same
storage life, which I thought was really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple other things, but did you
want to add anything about Bavaria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Bavaria is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like horticultural oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the conversation was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the whole concept of these biological
helpers have been evolving for millennia
[SPEAKER_00]: along with their targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you get a Bavaria strain from
Chile or one from northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have different efficacies
on different insects because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved with different insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the complexity of,
like you just mentioned, storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different pH range that you want
to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the timing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like with any IPM product for insects,
the timing is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get that, you know,
usually when it's an early molting stage
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can have better efficacy against
the insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just really important to make
sure that you're, you know, in the fly
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing terms, match the hatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you've got the
right strain for the right target insect
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you are taking all of the
environmental factors into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, temperature, pH, those sort of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way you would want to do that if
you're deciding between Cucumeris or
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirski.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to look at the
environment in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just, I was really blown away
by how complex these Bavaria strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: and how specific they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really thought that the,
you know, because we're trying to limit
[SPEAKER_00]: how wet the plant gets, even in veg,
the conversation about cold fogging
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria was really intriguing to me
because that's never occurred to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that for a
propagation room or a veg room would
[SPEAKER_00]: really free up a lot of labor and get you
the coverage you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing that I'll, I have another
interview later today with Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownbridge at Biowork talking about,
he's a pathologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to talk a lot more about
Bavaria and these microbes in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that he's discovered
for testing that I hope to get him to
[SPEAKER_01]: elaborate on is that some of these brands,
and I'm not talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these, the major brands like Biowork,
but some of the people, even in the living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil game that are selling Bavaria have
levels, spore counts so low in their
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you can't even get any sort
of efficacy with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's just not possible for that
to have any actual effect on an insect
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the spore counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may be wasting your money as a
grower if you're buying some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not unique to the living soil
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of
companies out there in the egg world too
[SPEAKER_01]: that just have poor quality product in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't assume that all of Bavaria is
going to perform the same or is of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is that other
product labels have actually had claims of
[SPEAKER_01]: spore counts so high that it would not be
physiologically possible to fit that many
[SPEAKER_01]: spores into that given volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their labels are just, completely
inaccurate too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting topic when we start
thinking about marketing and how it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: into play and what people are claiming
around Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just, I guess, buyer beware when it
comes to that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with Mycorrhizae where
you'll see a product that lists,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an endo form of Mycorrhizae,
but the spore count is so low that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a marketing blur,
but there's no efficacy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to do your research
and use trusted products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, since you brought it up,
one of the questions that we get is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is there Mycorrhizae fungus in
your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we don't add it to our soil
mix is because it would strictly be a way
[SPEAKER_01]: of just getting it on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't actually have any sort of
efficacy because it's impossible to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: high enough spore count to make any
difference when adding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your media, you really need to add it
specifically to the root zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: right at transplant time, if you're going
to use it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see it, read the label and
then realize that the label might not be
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate because of storage conditions,
inaccurate product management,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a variety of other reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these microbes get tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on though, since we are talking
about microbes, let's talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about Aspergillus because we've had a few
people bring that up, bring it to our
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell me about Aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to a few people who have
failed for it in their grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we manage it most effectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, and this will dovetail into
another conversation about root ball
[SPEAKER_00]: removal and why we like that, but we can
come back to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal pathogens, Aspergillus
specifically, there's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with cultural controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of your pathogen control
starts with cultural controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure that you're
moving around your facility always from
[SPEAKER_00]: the head house downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever want to reverse that and go
from a flower room back into your your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: or your mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good idea to wear some sort
of protective clothing, whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: scrubs or a Tyvek suit or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the folks at work and grow
facilities have a plant or two at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're passionate about it, most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't want whatever might be
going on there to come to your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you seal them into some scrubs
or something, hopefully that doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: loose in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one more layer of
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like bleach mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you took me to Goldleaf, I was really
happy to see that they had bleach mats at
[SPEAKER_00]: every every door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the idea of having a spray
bottle with 90 percent rubbing alcohol in
[SPEAKER_00]: every room so that, you know, as you
enter, you can spray yourself down from
[SPEAKER_00]: the forearms and hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option is to use nitrile gloves,
but I don't like to use all that plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: if I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keeping your tools clean,
you know, make sure that you're you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got at least two pairs of shears
per person so that they can rotate those
[SPEAKER_00]: out into a bleach solution or something
between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to come down to labor
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want to stop your
workers every 30 seconds, so they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: always be some potential cross
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other thing is really
controlling your environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus likes a hot, humid room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it really likes to have microclimates,
you know, little hot, moist areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so defoliation and good fan air
movement throughout the room is really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's that's a weird catch 22,
because if you look at powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs moist, high humidity to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also needs dry air to sporulate in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're kind of damned if you do
damned if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want high air movement to
prevent PM and to prevent aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got Fusarium, you don't want
a lot of CFUs moving through that room
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just going to destroy the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, like we were saying with
insects or anything, you really have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a definitive ID on what you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to know, is this
aspergillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this some other fungal pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the cultural controls that
that you can do for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, like you just said,
you're going to talk to Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Brownbridge, Dr. Michael Brownbridge
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and I talked about some products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those being trichoderma that you
can get into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have some other products that
could be beneficial for dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you really want to make sure that
you're cleaning your rooms as thoroughly
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible between rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could get in there with a good
oxidizer and get the floors and the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see people doing things like
running trim machines and in a grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, they'll harvest and hang
their plants in the same grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the opportunity to really
inoculate that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see people who pass,
pass, pass, and then all of a sudden they
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just those spore counts are just
building up, building up, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually they take over a room and
you'll lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some of the main things
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a really good air exchange so you
don't want to just be pushing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: room around or the same air around the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get the old air out,
the humidity out, and you need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, am I leaving something out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just want to say aspergillus
is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be at differing levels
depending on your media and soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're, you know,
if you're using a compost in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it in a variety of different
potting soils from different
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about management, like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something for people to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really it probably involves a deeper
conversation around their specific
[SPEAKER_01]: facility or grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are some, you know, good basics
that everyone should be doing for IPM in
[SPEAKER_01]: any space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reports I've seen, the white
papers I've read is that they find
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus in every soil, every potting
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's just good to know
what you're up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can take the correct steps and
keep your facility clean, get good biology
[SPEAKER_00]: into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exclusion is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we want to, you know, meet it head
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to switch directions and talk a
little bit about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few things, you know,
we've done podcasts now on heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back and listen to my one with
Brian Mason, soil doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few things I want to just bring
to highlight for folks because we are
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing more and more people having to
deal with regulations around heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to cover, why don't you go
first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon, just mention a few of the
highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a list here of things I
want to add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of something I left out on the
aspergillus that comes into this same
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation is getting rid of the root
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that heavy metals accumulate
as well as viroids in the root material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recent research has proven that
that's where we're getting the heaviest
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's heavy metals or viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are heavily recommending that
folks remove their root ball so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get that out of their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that just goes back to a comment
I meant to make about the aspergillus is
[SPEAKER_00]: that indoors, folks that leave any sort of
detritus, and this includes cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and mulch, that's a perfect breeding
ground for aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to grow aspergillus,
you would leave all your dead leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really important to keep those
beds clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to try to do that,
you want to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating that organic material below
the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I still just, I would rather
just remove it in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with heavy metals, again, we want to
remove that root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many potential contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be dust, from lead arsenate
that's been sitting in your neighbor's
[SPEAKER_00]: field from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these are persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be in your compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we see that frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many pH up and down products
can bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really important to get a test
for anything you want to add to your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not going to be able to get
those heavy metals out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to prevent them from getting
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try to control it with a higher
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some really interesting things
with biochar tying up heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some interesting research into
silicon being able to outcompete heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals for accumulation in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some things we can try to
do to mediate a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all goes back to testing your
products, making sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you contact a producer and ask for
a heavy metal test and they blow you off
[SPEAKER_00]: or they won't send it, you can look that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe California has a registry for
all the organic products, but you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if they don't send you a
heavy metal test, that's a red flag for me
[SPEAKER_00]: just to keep looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I never have a problem if people
ask us for additional testing or they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to test the product themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to highlight some main things,
again, heavy metals are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, when water or soil comes in
contact with metal, that's a contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: risk for heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen high levels of certain heavy
metals in pH down specific products from
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty big name brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do your research there and test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what levels in soil will
cause a plant failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't say that this PPM of arsenic in
soil is going to cause or in your media is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cause this level of PPM in your
plant because there's so many variables
[SPEAKER_01]: between your VPD, how are you watering,
what your PPFD is on light intensity on
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant, what sort of biological
activity and nutrient cycling do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things are going to affect
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the genetics that you're running?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different cultivars are going to be more
efficient at pulling up heavy metals than
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, if you need to pull heavy
metals out of your soil, unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis are probably the best
plant for that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the key for us, what we try to do at
KISS at least is we try to start at a
[SPEAKER_01]: level that we know we're going to pass
regulation below whatever that regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we know that we have a removal
rate because we know there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: some heavy metals in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to keep them low.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to manage them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go to harvest your crop,
you're going to be pulling out small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have to do is make sure that that
level is going to allow you to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next round will be
re-embedded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're re-amending with less than you
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always moving in the direction of
removing heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly enough, we did a test
with gold leaf soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think it was a couple of years ago
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're probably six years into that
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually tested it in the Michigan
market, sent a sample over there and it
[SPEAKER_01]: passed undetected for heavy metals,
which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know that it's possible with this
method to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pass, but you do have to be diligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where we see people get in trouble is
when they start adding other products and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they haven't tested all the products
and they just assume from the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we start to see people
fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more products you add,
the more variables you have to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: test, which can get very expensive down
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be teas, that can be
microbials, that can be just about
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said, pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really do have to do your research
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even get into,
I just saw a webinar the other day by
[SPEAKER_01]: Patricia Atkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to get her on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's with Antilia Scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she was talking about with heavy
metals is the laboratory side and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: fail points there are in the laboratory
from the type of water that they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: to how clear in the facility is if they
have metal furniture in that space to the
[SPEAKER_01]: gloves that they're choosing to use
actually have heavy metals on the gloves
[SPEAKER_01]: and levels of zinc and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're looking at levels that
low, the margin of error, that small 0.02
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per billion or something like that,
the margin of error is as the unit gets
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, the margin for error
exponentially gets bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to manage everything upfront
by exclusion and testing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing is RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about RO water because I
get a lot of calls about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But RO water is hungry water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no ions in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything it passes over,
it's going to grab ions from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's going through cheap plastic,
if it's going through a brass spigot,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's going any metal plastic,
anything that that water is passing
[SPEAKER_00]: through or over could very well grab heavy
metals and deposit those into your bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that that water is
buffered before you get it back into your
[SPEAKER_02]: beds or pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had something else on heavy metals,
but I'm blanking on it at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to come back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just remembered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing with heavy metals too
is they appear to accumulate more and
[SPEAKER_01]: older tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can send in, I think,
a younger part of the plant as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: less stem in that plant, that is probably
going to test lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see more research around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just sort of the direction I
would head based off of what we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to pass that along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on to a new topic, I know you
get asked a lot, like, what's the secret
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that special product that's going
to make your grow, I guess, special?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, after 38, I'll have 38 years of
cannabis under my belt in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done, you know, I drove for 18
years, organics for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried every kind of setup that you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kiss system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't want this to be a kiss
ad, but just a simple organic living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with testing and amendments with safe
products is the easiest workflow I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after trying, you know,
the Frankenstein approach, just every
[SPEAKER_00]: product you can imagine, the most simple
SOP has given me the best yields and the
[SPEAKER_00]: best quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all comes down to managing your
environment, making sure that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate nutrients available to your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the secret sauce is time and patience
and paying attention to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to your plants, observing your
plants, taking data, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in there, doing scoping,
defoliating, looking for pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the secret sauce is the
folks that spend more time in their garden
[SPEAKER_00]: have better grows because I could give,
you know, 10 different growers all the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same inputs, cultivars, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to have dramatically
different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks, you know, and it's not
their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers are burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growing is it can be monotonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, you know, it's a lot of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can easily burn 80 hour work
week on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of growers get burned out and
they come in, they check, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's watered and they just want to
get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't fault them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that you need to do is spend
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can automate your watering,
so you're not doing that by hand and get
[SPEAKER_00]: more time, you know, that's a that's a
dunk just for the return on investment
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anything you can do so that you can
free up your grower, especially your
[SPEAKER_00]: higher end grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not on, you know, holding the
hose or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to get you better
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing would be if you
want to try a special secret sauce,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to try a product, you need to
start off with, you know, like we always
[SPEAKER_00]: tell people to start off with just water
only for their first round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, but, you know,
if we add this or we add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you add anything, you do not have
a base data set and you really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to get a base data set so you
can make decisions moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is a product that your buddy's
using or you read about or saw on a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and you really want to use it,
you need to set up a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only thing you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have other beds or pots with
the exact same PPFD, CO2, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the environment is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can determine at the end of
that round did I get a statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant bump on my return for the money I
spent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if you just got a four
by four tent, you can go crazy because you
[SPEAKER_00]: just really can't spend too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's a lot of fun to
play around with different products and
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on scale, you really have to take a
scientific approach to it because you just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't afford to spend or wait to waste,
I should say, that that kind of capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of products out
there that, you know, are marketed to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that don't really produce,
you know, and look to look to traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: ag as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my mantras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always begging people to, you know,
cannabis is very special to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's very special to me,
to my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not special in agriculture and
there's no corn or soybean guys spending
[SPEAKER_00]: six grand on aloe water or, you know,
some of these products that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a place and time and a small in a
small operation where that might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for growers on scale, you need to be
spending time with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to check in daily and that
that would be my my soapbox on all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have I have a couple of thoughts
on this, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, I agree that there's a lot of I
see a marketing all the time on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and even stuff like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pushed forward as education around
how to grow, but it's really just product
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just pushing products on you and
it it frankly drives me a little crazy and
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to combat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it's a lot of
hype around product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it or at least how
I how I approach it is, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to control for a variable,
test one thing at a time, get a baseline,
[SPEAKER_01]: but add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do get a result, try and figure
out, think about why you got that result.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you had some sort of limiting
factor growth that that product addressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was nitrogen, whether it was
nutrient cycling through microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was, you know, whatever micro
macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, that's what you
want to consider when you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a non marketing perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then the other thing about this,
and I really, I really love this about
[SPEAKER_01]: Nate over a gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for him, his secret sauce is his soil,
because he got soil over eight years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that soil has been in his facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been managing it in a very specific
microclimate that's unique to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the expression that he's going to
get from his genetics is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that microbial succession and
and coevolution between his cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and his soil that's been happening over
the last eight years, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what probably 40, 40 plus cycles
now in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for him, his secret sauce is his
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's his that's his special
sauce, because it allows him to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, unique terpene expression,
you know, different unique cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's kind of a better way
to approach the secret sauce idea is just
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that as a as a grower,
that soil that you're managing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are reusing it is going to become
unique to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, it's no longer a name
brand soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now your sort of your ecology habitat
that you created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can be special and can be a
marketing tool down the road for growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I and I I think that that that's
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't agree more when Allison
Schaeffer just got interviewed for their
[SPEAKER_00]: local paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Justin McGill's lead grower for the
high end Mako Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said are either she said either their
secret recipe or there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their secret weapon is their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes back to the same thing
they've been running kiss soil for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to, you know, obviously there's
no humic fraction in a potting substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you do start to approach something
similar to where you've got nutrients just
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing into solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the microbiology
that's going to be completely unique to
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment and your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether that's driving tricone
production or driving a different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that that is what's going to set
you aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things we were talking
about earlier, as far as like how you
[SPEAKER_00]: manage your soil, keep it healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have everything to do with
your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, you could give four
different growers the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put it in their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one's going to definitely come out on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is going to have, you know,
a better expression just because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I want to change topics again
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk a little bit about no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I are going to agree on this
because we've talked about it multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times, but I want to kind of share some
thoughts around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I met Steve Cantwell,
Green Life Productions down in Vegas,
[SPEAKER_01]: face-to-face for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, I think it was at the Living
Soil Summit where we were both speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to hear him speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to say, I have a ton of,
I mean, I already had a ton of respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy, but I love what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love his thought process and the
innovation that he brings to the community
[SPEAKER_01]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Steve's a cover crop guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's a no-till guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's came up with the idea of
bottomless pots, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially very brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to do some trials with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I share this twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because I'm going to give you my
reasoning for why I don't do those things
[SPEAKER_01]: in the facilities that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I don't recommend them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them still do it and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also that we're all a community here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, like this
innovation that pushes us forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we become dogmatic in the way
that we grow, we aren't open to what other
[SPEAKER_01]: people are doing or what other people are
sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really limits us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people try and act like
we're against each other on this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we have differing opinions,
Steve and I get along great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no drama there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to talk about why we don't
recommend cover crops indoors and why I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really like the term no-till indoors
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a complicated topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops, potentially, one,
they're another crop you have to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, they are habit and ecology for pests
and pathogens, potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three, and the biggest reason for me
even though those two are huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I want to mix my nutrients back
into my soil, down into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to top dress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of our short flowering cycle,
I want those nutrients available
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having cover crops in there makes it
impossible or much more challenging for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have this term no-till,
which when we amend indoor beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not truly tilling anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not running a tiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're shoveling it, which does not have
the same impacts on biology that a tiller
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not creating a compaction zone
like you would with a tiller for using a
[SPEAKER_01]: shovel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other advantages of this,
just to highlight, are you're removing the
[SPEAKER_01]: root, which would potentially lower your
heavy metal content in that soil for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting your nutrients directly
into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this disturbance hypothesis
that Dr. Ben Higgins talks about that I
[SPEAKER_01]: might need to do an episode with him on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, the idea is that we have
ecological systems, starting with our
[SPEAKER_01]: primary systems, which would be right
after a volcano erupts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have bare rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly, life starts to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are our beginning successional
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way through, then you have
grasslands, temperate forests,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way through to our old growth
forests, like the redwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be considered an apex or climax
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we have the most biodiversity,
and in theory, where cannabis would most
[SPEAKER_01]: like to grow, is really in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in these apex, no-till,
climax ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where we have the most biodiversity
is through disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that disturbance allows us to maintain
a little bit more ecological diversity and
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, I don't know how anyone would
ever prove or disprove what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because we don't have the technology
to truly measure these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of how rapidly these microbial
communities are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel like that's really our sweet
spot and why we see the results that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you want to add around
no-till or cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm on the exact same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a no-till person, but no-till doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean no-till, because I always bring up
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphate's going to move a half an inch
in your profile on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not scratching in three or
four inches down to where your roots can
[SPEAKER_00]: get to it, your plants are going to be
super slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dress is a super slow release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology can't get to it and make it
available in an ionic form for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're potentially creating an
impermeable layer on top that would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow fungal spores of some sort,
some good, some bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I love what you were just saying
about Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to mimic nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of loss in nature and we're
trying to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I think that you nailed all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this idea of doing what nature does
is I think a little bit of a fallacy
[SPEAKER_01]: because nature doesn't have weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature doesn't select for one crop species
over another to the exclusion of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see the level of health in
nature typically that you would,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially across a vast quantity of
plants, which is what we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: when we grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't see monocrops in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just going to walk out into an
old growth forest and see a field of
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous cannabis anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the natural processes are
not beneficial to us in a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I do love cover crops,
mulches, those sorts of things outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even in green half environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing too is just that while
we don't see monocrops in nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do see, I guess what I want to add to
this is we do see healthy plants in nature
[SPEAKER_01]: and that biodiversity is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But adding a five or seven cover crop is
not really increasing our biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere near the levels that we would see
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that's still monocropping pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes me so nervous to add a
cover crop indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it helps with your moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather set up a blue mat system
and automate my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not having to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can prevent erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always joke that if you've got
erosion indoors, you should try an
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument that maybe growing is not the
thing you should be doing because how are
[SPEAKER_00]: you creating erosion indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shouldn't be a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it makes, we're already adding in
the nutrients based on very tested
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need any nitrogen fixing in
our beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it makes it so next to impossible
to till in your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to tear up all that
organic matter and work it under the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes back to the aspergillus
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got cover crop and you get a
pest or a pathogen in there, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have hell to pay on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve talks about how he's growing in
a desert in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so his pest pressure is very different
than what a lot of us face in other parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have a lot of crops being grown
around him from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is downright militant about who
gets into his facility and who gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: his flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said in his talk that there's a lot of
people that work in his facilities and
[SPEAKER_01]: have never seen his flowering spaces
because they don't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the sort of IPM that allows you
to do the things that he's doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, because he's really doing a great
job of keeping pests away from his plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and out of his facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not allowed to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work for him, you're not allowed to
do a lot of those things that lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of respect for Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I have a different opinion on
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you're always open to
conversation and even being wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I love to keep the conversations
and keeping our minds open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we learn and how we get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of my favorite things about
cultivation is I learn something every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was joking with somebody the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, sometimes I learned that I was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got an ego, some level of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's humbling to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, it's exciting because you get to
go off on a whole other area of learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very grateful for the folks who
have differing opinions, but the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that bring it to the table respectfully
and in a genuine, sincere desire to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more and to help other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that that's part of the
conversation, just keeping everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: minds open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to push the needle towards
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every path of the organic,
sustainable movement has stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one other question I get all the time,
especially since I started doing the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: trivia posts on Instagram, was diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people send plant photos of some issue
or another they're dealing with a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you approach diagnosing a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so diagnosis in person is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me to diagnose from across the
country over the phone is really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a systematic approach to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got the dichotomous key on the
website that folks can look at that will
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a really good fighting chance at
figuring out what what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you really need to do is
determine if it's a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the easiest ways to do that,
one of the tried and true ways is to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at your individual ranges and any range
would be, you know, whether it's a bed or
[SPEAKER_00]: a group of pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I say range, I just mean a
uniform cultivar and feed schedule and
[SPEAKER_00]: then uniform environmentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at that and that whole bed
is showing some symptom, it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing or something, you know,
then if the entire bed is affected,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can usually safely assume that it's
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it might be a nutrient issue because
the whole bed got overwatered and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: been root death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's showing nitrogen issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can see a consistent across the
entire range issue, then you're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: safe to assume you need to go down the
nutrient path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests and pathogens tend to jump around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll have one plant tanking and
then a plant right beside it that's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's time to get out the scope,
look at roots, maybe do some testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you if you see something uniform,
you want to inspect the range and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the plants and what the first
thing you want to notice is where is the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem starting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry about what the issue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it starting on the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's starting on the bottom of the
plant, then it's a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's happening is the apical
growing tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plant is trying to reproduce
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just doing what biology does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to make progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to sacrifice those lower
leaves and flowers to the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that that's healthy and can
receive pollen and make seeds for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the plant wants to do to
preserve itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're losing nutrients at the
bottom, you know, it's a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you know, kind of break that
down pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's either nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium or magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium is probably the easiest one to
diagnose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that interveinal chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is chlorosis, you know,
that stays on the margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rapidly goes to necrosis,
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant will get dark,
but the bottoms, the tips will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn and the leaf will go necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, you just the whole leaf goes
yellow, goes chlorotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have leaf abscission where
the leaf will just pop off before it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pop it right off or fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then if it's not at the bottom,
then you know that it's a immobile
[SPEAKER_00]: element.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's where I see most of
the misdiagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks will see burning at the top
and assume that it's a nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in fact, that's almost always a
calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple that will show across the
entire plant like sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire plant will go kind of light
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's things that happen at the
top of the plant like like iron
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently in every grow I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the very top of the plant is a
little bit of lime green, especially where
[SPEAKER_00]: the petiole end of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's iron and it just grows out
repeatedly over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just using the dichotomous key to
see where on the plant it's starting will
[SPEAKER_00]: limit what nutrients you're going to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's very specific symptoms
that come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get out the nutrient
deficiencies in bedding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That book is a great book because you
could go around your yard and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, because that dichotomous key
is not specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed for cannabis with cannabis
illustrations to help growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can apply that to grasses,
to flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is you can't just get
that overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to have to look at
that dichotomous key and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to run through your plants and,
you know, practice on on what's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cannabis practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you go to a friend's house,
look at their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drive them crazy with diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just the more times you can
repeat that process where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a consistent symptom throughout the
range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where on the plant did it start?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on where on the plant it
started, start looking at the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's pretty straightforward to
dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the only other thing is just to
don't neglect environmental changes or
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big greenhouse and
everything's planted the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might have a corner that's shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, you know, accidentally
getting overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not getting the same growth
rate, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's first initial instinct
is it's nutrients and it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, but it might be some
environmental factor that's preventing it
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting into the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if your VPD is off, it doesn't
matter how much calcium you've got in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to get into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you covered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot to add there other
than, you know, when people send me their
[SPEAKER_01]: photos, I try to give a diagnosis,
but it's always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like you said, it's impossible
to tell just from a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can give you that information,
because a lot of times people will send me
[SPEAKER_00]: a picture of a leaf and they're like,
what's going on with the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could send me a picture of the
leaf, send me a picture of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, like backed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some information as to,
you know, when it started, where did it
[SPEAKER_00]: start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it homogeneous throughout the range?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it only one cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, Justin McGill
has one of the most amazing grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a surgery room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floors are polished and it's the
cleanest place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients are dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's their white star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always presents some deficiency at the
end of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as you are okay with that,
then the nutrients across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's always going to be
certain outlier cultivars that are super
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy feeders, super light feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that could be an issue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always, always consider the cultivar
and the environment as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin's facility is great in the sense of
the staff and how they, they care for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, keep things clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have, just if people go online and
look at the pictures on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: he does have old life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does have old tech in there,
but they still grow consistently really
[SPEAKER_01]: good plants because of all the other
reasons that you lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case people do go look that up and
check him out, which they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great grower and he's, they're
definitely at the best facility to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: along if you're interested in this style
of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last topic in under five minutes,
cause we're almost out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you get asked a lot about white
ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go ahead and touch on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll sign off on the podcast for
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make this really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line for white ash is it should not
be a driver for why you're selecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of myths that it's heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not flushed properly for hydro,
hydro grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a ton of research,
you know, you can go on the forums and get
[SPEAKER_00]: led down all kinds of Primrose pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, if you go back, like I said
earlier, go to traditional ag and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the research before you, you know,
spend money on something with white ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's tons of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can look at the tobacco
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of responsible for the whole
white myth, white ash mythology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also forestry services, both here and
in Europe, fire departments, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the study combustion science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's 200 years of,
of research that we can look at and ash
[SPEAKER_00]: color has nothing to do with pesticides,
has nothing to do with heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: has nothing to do with mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash color is determined by carbon and
whether all the organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the carbon based material has been
burned off and combusted, converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide and it's left the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all the carbon is left the
building, then you end up with a perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that's left behind are
the mineral constituents, a lot of sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, so when people say it
wasn't flushed and that's why it had too
[SPEAKER_00]: much nitrate or something like that in
the, in the plant, that's not why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: burning salt and pepper or dark,
you know, because in perfect white ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing that's left behind is the
mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a chemist who did a bunch
of experiments on it, but it all comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you could have the best herb in
the world that's not perfectly dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get a dark ash and
then you could have heavy metal,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide laden, horrible, schwaggy brick
weed, and it'll burn perfectly white if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super dry because all the carbon's
been burned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, I just don't
want people to, you know, that's a myth
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we don't get it out of cannabis,
you know, how do they, how do they get
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes to burn perfectly white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they spray products on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want tobacco ethics or sprays
in my cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want anything to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my incentive for trying to stomp on
this one particular myth is because if we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't stomp on this one, eventually we
will have cannabis producers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying their final product with
additives so that it will burn white.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is a driver, you know,
like THC, you know, is, is a huge driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into dispensary, that's what
they're going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a THC level on this, this,
and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know from blind tests that people
are picking their cannabis based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the terping profile more than the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes to drivers on why
you're paying, what you're paying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the experience is, you know,
if aesthetically it does something special
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to have white ash in your pipe or
on your joint, then cool, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the science behind it and
studying combustion science, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no validity to the white ash myth
at all, just zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes down to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can go ask a fireman,
probably the average fireman could do a
[SPEAKER_00]: much better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: of explaining this or, you know,
somebody in the forestry department,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the things that would prevent one or
one finished flower from being white
[SPEAKER_00]: versus another one would be the moisture
content and the resin content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a really interesting side note on
this is that THC to CBD ratios may have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do with it because the way
that the THC molecule, it, it's a 2D 2
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensional molecule, it lays flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a 3 dimensional molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you decarboxylate that,
you have the protonation of a carbon group
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to leave, but then there's a,
there's a, a proton has to come in for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: With CBD, because it's 3 dimensional,
that second ring is blocking that proton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's slowing the decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so could that be another part of the
puzzle as to why, you know, those ratios?
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly could, but bottom line,
end of the day is white ash has nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the quality of the, of the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything to add on that topic
as you know, but I appreciate you sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: that for folks and thanks for taking the
time today to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always fun.
