Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.

[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Anne Biclay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne is the co-author of The Hidden Half
of Nature, a book she wrote with her
[SPEAKER_00]: husband, David Montgomery, in my last
podcast interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne is a biologist, writer, and gardener
with wide-ranging interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has over two decades of professional
experience spanning field biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed restoration, environmental
planning and stewardship, and public
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: She uses her broad background and endless
fascination with the natural world to
[SPEAKER_00]: examine connections between people and
their environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne attended the University of
California, Santa Cruz, earning bachelor's
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees in biology and natural history.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also holds a master's degree in
landscape architecture from the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of California, Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks, Anne.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to get to talk to you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too, Chad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we start off giving listeners a
little bit of your background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I come from sort of a very broad
background for, you know, sort of formal
[SPEAKER_01]: education-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have degrees in biology and natural
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a graduate degree in a field that's
called environmental planning,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sort of a sub-discipline of
landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of my formal training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, it's no surprise that I
have ended up enamored with the botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: world because of all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my earliest memories as a kid,
I grew up in sort of the suburbs outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my earliest memories was
wandering around in our yard because you
[SPEAKER_01]: did that when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no screens or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you did was you went outside and
you explored the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me as a little kid, the yard was,
you know, plenty big as a four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: year old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it was early June.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, memories of cold and snow are
dim in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the garden, the garden hadn't really
quite woken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say this, my parents were
not like green thumb kind of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no big gardening history or
anything like that in my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had put plants in and they had
established a couple of small rock gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: within the larger yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember walking around to the back,
the back of the yard one day and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking down at these iris rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know how ugly those things look?
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like a piece of ginger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I followed the stock up and there
was this flower that I just could not
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that it had come out of that
gnarly, you know, dead looking rhizome
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I credit with sort of
the beginning, the beginning of what I now
[SPEAKER_01]: call a pretty bad case of plant lust on my
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always, I've just always enjoyed
being around plants and growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, in Colorado, you can't,
you know, now I live in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we've got, you know, pretty,
you know, year round growing season for
[SPEAKER_01]: many things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did was I commandeered this very
large table in our living room and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started filling it up with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All different kinds of house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that was how I sort of
satisfied my green thumb and my plant lust
[SPEAKER_01]: as I got to be older and figured out,
you know, how to plant a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to watch it grow and how to take care
of it and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I have always done
though, you know, once I moved out of home
[SPEAKER_01]: and went to college and stuff like that,
right, you start thinking about what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the yards and most of these places that
anybody rents, sort of look, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're kind of cruddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, there's not much there most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about the last thing that a
landlord really wants to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sort of cut my teeth on gardening at
a lot of different rental places over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was good about that is I think
growing plants is, it's definitely one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things one of those trial and error
kind of experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things work out and some things
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a plant will let you know,
you know, pretty much right away if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing the right things and if
you're doing the wrong things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you moved out to Seattle and
established your own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you talk about it in the beginning
of the Hidden Half of Nature, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote with David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that
experience with, I know you focused there
[SPEAKER_00]: on mulching and he had some unique
perspectives from a geological perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: on how quickly you were able to build the
soil in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because it was about this time
some years ago that we really,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we got going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have bought a house in Seattle years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of what drew us to, and this is
in the middle of the city, Ted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is not like some extra
large lot or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the middle of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what originally drew us to the house,
I remember we looked at the house in
[SPEAKER_01]: February.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that time of year, there's,
there's early February, there's not much
[SPEAKER_01]: going on, but you know, I could see that
there were a couple of trees, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously at that time of year,
all lawns in Seattle are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, that emerald green color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and what really attracted me was
that the house is built on one,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, we've built on one side of the lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that left the other side of the lot
really largely a blank slate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that and you know, I just had,
I had plants, plants adorning my eyeballs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like, all I saw was, Oh man,
the garden potential here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anything, anything like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't get, get going on the garden
quite as soon as, as we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of had some fixer upper stuff to
do inside of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's, what's, what's kind of
humorous at this point, it was definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: not funny at the time is that once we did
break ground to, to do the garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: we began with sort of very unlike today
where people are demolishing houses left
[SPEAKER_01]: and right around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't demolish the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started demolished everything that was
out in the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, I mean, as it turned out the
trees that had looked alive, at least a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of them were actually dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so the first order of business was
to remove these couple of dead trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a tree that's called a horse
chestnut that was engulfing one side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we removed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a mulberry tree that
actually had wonderful mulberries in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the winter time, it looked
horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody had previously topped that tree,
like about, you know, no less than 99
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like this Medusa head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, we got, we, we,
we got the stuff out of there that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was nearly everything because there
was really never to my eye anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone who had seriously garden here at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when we looked into the history of
the house, it was Norwegians, the
[SPEAKER_01]: Osterbergs who had, bought this lot and
built the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like a lot of people in this
region, they, at least at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, whatever blew in on the rain and
the wind, that's what your yard was made
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the long and the short of it is we
got everything cleared and we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, as, as that summer
progressed, as we were putting the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: in, you know, we started, like I said,
it was around, well, actually it was
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorial Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the guy was supposed to show up
the Friday before Memorial Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had been put off numerous times
that this guy was going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember just laughing and Dave and
I saying, Oh right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to show up the Friday
before Memorial Day weekend to start on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a large job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't, the guy had canceled so many
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were so surprised then when somebody,
his name was Jim and he walked up the
[SPEAKER_01]: driveway with a chainsaw and that's all he
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, all he said was, name's Jim,
here to start the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that day, Jim went loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a, he had been a logger previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, you know, he knew how to handle a
chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew how to take all the stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within about three or four hours,
our place looked like a moonscape and I
[SPEAKER_01]: completely freaked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, Oh my God, is this really
what we want?
[SPEAKER_01]: This place looks horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a stitch of green left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some bare spots, soil we're starting
to emerge and it only got worse from
[SPEAKER_01]: there, Tad, because we took the,
like, this is about a month later or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there was like a small bulldozer
thing driving around on the lot doing
[SPEAKER_01]: leveling and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time of year, the lot,
our soil, just, I realized Dave wasn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: he wasn't, you know, he doesn't even have
a green thumb to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like dirt is dirt is dirt to me
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, Oh man, this is looking worse
and worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil's getting like lighter colored by
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rocks seem to be breeding and how is
this ever going to grow anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: And worst of all, we got, we ended up
planting, you know, many of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that I, that I had, because I'd been sort
of stockpiling them for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years and they really wanted to get out of
their pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start planting them and then we run
into the dreaded glacial till,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is all over Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the glacial till is this hard pan
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as though somebody snuck in
back in time, poured concrete all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place, about eight, 10, 12 inches down,
and then they put the soil back on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'd hit this hard pan,
with a shovel and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke my elbow, broke my wrist on that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this, so we had, that was one
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with just what had happened on the lot
over the years, there was no, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: not any really organic matter buildup
because there were really not many sources
[SPEAKER_01]: of organic matter at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, so kind of, I'm sorry,
sort of this guy bringing on PTSD or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember also the other big problem
at that time of year is like water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, God, we are, you know,
I was cursing the landscape architect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, God, I can't believe we're out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle of August, you know, there's a
water shortage on the Cedar river.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I worked in the water and
salmon field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm just killing salmon,
trying to, you know, keep these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, what I knew from, you know,
previous short, short-term gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: things that I had done, you know,
at these various places that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: rented, I'm like, I got to get some
organic matter and I just get organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter and bring it and just layer it on
top of the soil because that is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut down on the watering, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I scrambled around for much of that
August and into the months of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, September through December in
the early, the next winter, getting any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of free and cheap organic matter that
I could and bringing it home and layering
[SPEAKER_01]: it on top of the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt there's just something really
satisfying to me when, especially after
[SPEAKER_01]: having gone through that sort of,
you know, somewhat traumatic experience to
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing up just a really nice mulch that
has like, you know, at least two,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe three or four different kinds of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a nice texture and there's a nice
moisture level to it and just laying it
[SPEAKER_01]: out on the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of feel like it's, everything's
just taken care of and I can walk away and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can let the green bodies of all the
plants in the garden just do what they
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's definitely one thing I've
learned in putting this garden in and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of it over the years is all of
us gardeners, and I don't care if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis or other things,
although I definitely understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: tendency with cannabis is intervention,
intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a, you know, we're trying to grow
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cash crop and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really have come to see over the
years that if you just give plants what
[SPEAKER_01]: they need, their bodies really know how to
take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's when we get in and start mucking
things up that it starts mucking up the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that a plant's green body works and
then we run into, you know, pest problems
[SPEAKER_01]: or we run into various other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that turns into sort of a
feedback loop where then we have to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: in with some other intervention to take
care of the first intervention that we
[SPEAKER_01]: caused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely something I see in my
own garden, especially as plants mature
[SPEAKER_01]: and the trees in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tree is just a really amazing thing
because the larger it grows and as it
[SPEAKER_01]: begins to mature, it becomes in sort of
normal situations, it becomes better and
[SPEAKER_01]: better equipped to take care of itself
because it's dropping these loads of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter in the form of leaves on
top of the ground and it's the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of plant food for the tree itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm still, so that's sort of
the story of the garden and how it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really by returning organic matter to the
soil that I feel like it got our garden
[SPEAKER_01]: off to a good start and it really saved
our butts that first couple of summers
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were watering and it's only
continued to, I think, build the health of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because some people will come
over and they're like, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't use any fertilizers or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm not going to buy that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second of all, in the kind of garden that
we have, I'm not looking, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: exception of the vegetable beds,
I'm not looking for rapid, I'm not looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for these plants to put on a lot of
biomass and rapid growth because these are
[SPEAKER_01]: all, for the most part, right,
trees are perennials and these shrubs are
[SPEAKER_01]: perennials and I want them to have a nice
steady rate of growth because any biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: that a plant puts out in really sort of
rapid short order that's being put out
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond what its body would do normally,
that's just like putting out pest food and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen food and that is something,
you know, no gardener, no gardener wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like to see a plant that has a
nice rate of growth, say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring and then it slows down in
the summer and then that's kind of where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you don't get gangly looking
plants, you get robust and full looking
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and like I said, there's,
I don't think a plant has the ability when
[SPEAKER_01]: it is putting out a ton of growth,
I don't think a plant always has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to stock all of its defensive
chemicals throughout all of the new growth
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're, you know, heavily fertilizing
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you ask anybody, you know,
oh, well, when did the aphids come on or
[SPEAKER_01]: when did this thing came on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, most of those
problems happen during, not always,
[SPEAKER_01]: but often during, you know, growth spurts
of plants because the pests know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, there's that nice, young, fresh
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's where I'm going to go,
you know, insert my pincher thing or my
[SPEAKER_01]: sucker thing and start eating up this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like to think about,
what I like to do is sort of try to match
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant both to my goals as a gardener and
to what the capability of the soil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like a well-grown plant is
reflecting the quality of the soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the environment in which it
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to touch on this idea of
organic matter a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly in the sense that I know that
not all organic matter is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, putting out chicken manure is very
different than putting out arborous chips
[SPEAKER_00]: just based on the carbon to nitrogen
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on your experiences with
that and what you were using as sources
[SPEAKER_00]: for mulching in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up a really good point because I
had a beautiful tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It since died and I blame myself partly
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this tree called the red bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a, or Circus occidentalis is
sort of a native one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this tree is, it's got these gorgeous
heart shaped leaves and I had a cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: of it that had this great name that I
love, forest pansy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who came up with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this tree, this tree was,
was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaf color was knocked my socks off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the fall color on this tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I planted that tree, it was a
bare root tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like maybe the diameter of my,
my thumb and my index finger together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty small tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was fortunate enough to win the zoo
do lottery and the zoo do for those
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners who don't know, this is
composted manure of the herbivores at
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle zoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the zoo has a program where they handle
all the composting of that manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every spring and fall you send a
postcard in and you can get to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is an animal manure and it is
animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maneuvers are high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that nitrogen is what fuels
mostly the green growth of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought, Oh, this tree needs to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I put a lot of zoos in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The zoo do on that tree probably two or
three seasons in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, let me tell you that tree grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really grew, but that tree also has a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got really lousy branching structure,
which is to say that, uh, that tree really
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to be a shrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no central dominant leader that,
you know, shoots up and that has,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, well behaved and well structured
lateral branches coming off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: central leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, what this tree had was maybe four or
five dominant leader stems shooting up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the problem with that after about
its 10th year was that those branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: those little stems became bigger and
bigger and bigger branches, heavier and
[SPEAKER_01]: heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it began to split, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where those, those branches joined the
main trunk of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought back to what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it was, like I said,
it's just the natural structure of that
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I had boosted the growth like
crazy of that tree in the early years with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that zoo do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I knocked that off after like
several years, cause I was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: standing back going, wow, this tree is
growing bigger or faster than I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, I just started doing
straight wood chip mulches and a straight
[SPEAKER_01]: wood chip mulch for me, I really like
because it's really, really good at doing
[SPEAKER_01]: two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suppresses weeds and it does not give a
seed, a weed seed, a place to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because wood chips are almost,
well, they're from a composting
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, they're considered,
you know, uh, purely, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all carbon, very, they're not really,
they're not a nitrogen source at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that because it's a very slow
feed, slow decomposition process.
[SPEAKER_01]: As, as the wood chips come in contact,
of course, with microbial life and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and other, and sources of nitrogen in the
soil, they will decompose, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a slow process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my hard lesson in learning the
difference between carbon sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter and nitrogen sources of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now around my trees, because they're
all, they're healthy, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing their thing of putting on a
normal amount of growth for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: species they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I do straight wood chip mulch on
my trees and what I save my nitrogen rich
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of organic matter for,
which these days, my primo source of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of nitrogen rich organic matter,
my prized sources of organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: my prized source, which I always wish I
could have more of is the worm compost
[SPEAKER_01]: that I get out of my worm bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is solely dedicated to my
vegetables, my vegetable beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, vegetables,
I guess they'd be, you know, the closest
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to, to, uh, cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are annual crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're looking for is lots of
biomass, rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and with my vegetables, you know,
I want to get them to whatever they're
[SPEAKER_01]: harvestable state is, whether that's a
fruit, like a tomato or a floppy,
[SPEAKER_01]: a floppy green leaf or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I dedicate my nitrogen
sources of organic matter is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable bed and other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I'll do spot, uh, I'll do,
I'll do spot composting, say, or not
[SPEAKER_01]: composting, but I'll, I'll put out my
Zudu, uh, as perennials are coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see that one is sort of poking along,
I'll go and I'll, I'll, I'll top dress
[SPEAKER_01]: with compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I never, I rarely, rarely, well,
I actually never, I never dig organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter into my existing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in part, that's because I've got an
existing plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't want to be messing around
with its roots and be trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter down, you know,
in, you know, several inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down below the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're really blessed with in Seattle
here is with all this rain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put compost around the crown of a
perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might throw a few wood chips on top of
that compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I let, I let, you know,
the rain and the heat and microbial action
[SPEAKER_01]: decompose that and, and pull those
nutrients down into the soil, which then
[SPEAKER_01]: brings them, uh, in contact with the roots
and the plant can take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it needs and wants in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's, uh, that's sort of how
I think about organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I'm somewhat, um,
I think there's something instinctual in
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings, both, um, both about
hoarding things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend who says, yeah, that is the whole
problem with agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned us all into a bunch of hoarders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoarding grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoarding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in my mind, in my case, I'm kind of
an organic matter hoarder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that is to say that mostly what
I, I hoard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has to do with the quantities in
which it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get, you know, three or four or five
yards of wood chips, I don't, the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: can't take, you know, all of those wood
chips at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I store, I store wood chips and I will
pull them out at different times of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, typically fall and spring is
when I like to spread wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm doing something in the summer,
uh, and I know, oh yeah, I've got my stash
[SPEAKER_01]: of wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just go quickly, you know,
get a wheelbarrow full and do some spot
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching where say, uh, you know,
I'm finding it thin in one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, it's, it's very,
you know, organic matter is in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and becomes incorporated into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very elusive because you'll think
you've put an adequate amount out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, by that, I mean,
you know, three, four, five inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go out in mid, mid to late
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, where'd all that stuff go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like scratching around and,
you know, I have like a half an inch or an
[SPEAKER_01]: inch left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes depending on the plant and
the situation and exposure and aspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I might, I might sort of touch
up mulch, uh, in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I, I generally, I guess the
upshot on all of that is nitrogen where I
[SPEAKER_01]: want, um, lots of biomass and especially
leafy growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing I pay attention to
with vegetables is, uh, so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the bag of fertilizer and the
whole NPK thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fruits in order for you fruiting
vegetables, you know, tomato or cucumber
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put always a little bit of phosphorus
out, um, later, a little bit later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer to get, to make sure that the plant
has enough phosphorus to get it going in
[SPEAKER_01]: its fruiting stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course what comes before fruit is
the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I, I like to pay attention to that
for when I'm growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, something, something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to grow basil just cause there's
just nothing that beats fresh pesto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's certainly a nitrogen,
a nitrogen hog of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll get some pretty fantastic
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one garden I had before I knew
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was putting barely composted
chicken manure out, uh, around some basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't burn it, but oh my God,
I got like just incredible, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible leaves of basil that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were almost as big as the palm of my
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that, that's what nitrogen
and nitrogen rich, uh, sources of compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and organic matter can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to let listeners know that
when you're talking about wood chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about arborist chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I know for us with our,
with our farm, we have a relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: a local arborist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever he gets a load of
deciduous chips, we always request those
[SPEAKER_00]: in cause they break down faster and then
we'll use the evergreen chips or things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that from, uh, those trees as our,
um, pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they, they take a little longer to
break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we use wood chips a little
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great in our, in our chicken yard
because the high carbon is balanced with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, nitrogen from the chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, uh, they break down quite,
quite nicely and give us a nice layer of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, of, uh, compost underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to go ahead and transition
into talking about sort of your area of
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise in terms of the biological
aspects and the role that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes play in, in breaking down
this organic matter and in, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of making these, these nutrients
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we just posted on, on Twitter the
other day, this really, um, interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: paper that, that came out that I knew this
before, but I always like to be reminded
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, and it's this we think we think
about about organic matter as being plant
[SPEAKER_01]: derived in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking of my garden
specifically, you know, I'll see leaves in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall and they've come off the trees
and they're right where I want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about that organic matter,
you know, being a part of the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle that is feeding the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this paper showed is that most of the
organic matter, I don't know about much of
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic matter in plants and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that it starts with plants,
but all of that organic matter becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporated into the bodies of trillions
and trillions of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's bacteria, that's fungi,
that's, uh, protists, that's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just the microorganisms,
but becomes incorporated into the bodies
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that eat the microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you step it up to, you know,
slightly larger forms of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, worms and nematodes and,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that most of the organic matter that
ends up in soil, it's getting there,
[SPEAKER_01]: not because it's dead plant matter,
but because it's dead microbial matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really interesting way to
think about, uh, organic matter and
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter cycling, because how do we
get, um, a lot of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, flourishing and thriving in
the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And by this, I mean the beneficial ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We of course are not talking, you don't
want a bunch of pathogens in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want, we always want our beneficial
microorganisms and other life forms to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in larger numbers, bigger populations and
so on than the pathogens and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have all of these life
forms in the soil, they're just like us at
[SPEAKER_01]: our dinner table and they need to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what the plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what all this dead plant matter is
doing, whether it's wood chip or a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: green leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is food for all of the
microorganisms, which become the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that is what ends up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it even goes beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know now that there's a,
uh, one of the most life dense zones on
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire planet is around the root
system of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that area is called the rhizosphere,
R-H-I-Z-O and then sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sphere is, you know, just area around
in rhizo is, I can't remember if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Greek or Latin for root, but I think about
it as the house of the root, the area of
[SPEAKER_01]: the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where bacteria and fungi in
particular are running to the root system
[SPEAKER_01]: of a healthy plant and healthy soil as
though that is, um, you know, their
[SPEAKER_01]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a very good reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area called the rhizosphere is where
a plant will take up to like 40% of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds that it has made through
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these compounds are things like
carbohydrates and fats and proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns these compounds, uh,
well, a microorganism considers all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a plant is exuding these compounds
out of its roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name for that is exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just think outward flowing food from
the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microorganisms lap that stuff up and then
in return they're making metabolites out
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, out of these compounds that
they've received from the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like any organism, they excrete things
out of their bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the microbial metabolites that
have been discovered in the soil include
[SPEAKER_01]: things like plant growth, promoting
hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is, this is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got one part of the world
of life the microorganisms making things
[SPEAKER_01]: that help another completely area of life,
the botanical world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some of the things that
happen in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it, it tells us that this is also
one of the, we often think about
[SPEAKER_01]: co-evolution, uh, as, as being an
occurring in the above ground realm of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's green body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the birds, and the bees and
the flowers and the intricate,
[SPEAKER_01]: intricate way in which that all works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the symbiotic relationships below
ground are just every bit as sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: and long standing as what is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're actually go back even
further because they predate flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, this is really, um,
this is really fundamental and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: important that we have some of the
grandest symbiotic relationships on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet occurring right beneath our feet
and in a place that we still don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't, we, we, we may never know
how everything works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, what that tells me is,
uh, is a couple things because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the soil around the
roots of a plant is so fundamental to a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's health and wellbeing that really
what we ought to be doing with whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of plant we're growing is seeking
ways to support those symbiosis because
[SPEAKER_01]: long before we had agrochemical companies,
long before we had bags of fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these other various things in the
agricultural and horticultural world,
[SPEAKER_01]: all a plant ever had was the symbiotic
relationship where it's feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, the microbes are making
metabolites and the plant is pulling in
[SPEAKER_01]: those metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not only just metabolites,
but fungi in particular will, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they can greatly extend the
functionally anyway, the reach of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll be out far away from a
plant pulling things like phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the P of the NPK out of the soil
and they transport it back to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and give it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the sorts of natural
processes that we don't need to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have, I'd rather have fungi
doing my work for me than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: running out and buying, um, synthetic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, we, we also know that,
you know, plants and the microbial,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil microbiome, um, they've worked
out their relationships with their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their trades in the rhizosphere in ways
that keeps both, you know, the rate and
[SPEAKER_01]: growth of the plant sort of in balance
with the soil so that you're not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: excess growth that becomes, you know,
food for, food for some pest or pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really think of the microbial world,
the soil microbiome, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the root microbiome as, um,
it's sort of like the plant arsenal
[SPEAKER_01]: combined with the plant pharmacy,
combined with the plant, uh, say cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: communication device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a ton of signaling that goes
on between the microbes around the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, and the plant itself that,
that are related to how, uh, plants defend
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves against above ground and below
ground pests and how, um, plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: communicating with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's a really, really
fascinating, um, world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I would love it if, um,
I know a lot of cannabis growers for
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate and historic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing, they're growing these
plants inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is, um, that's just
the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that, but there is, I think
that's hard on a plant's body to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to be sort of taken out of,
out of where a plant would normally grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in the soil, outside,
in sunlight, exposed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of biological and non-biological
factors that give the plant its,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, its heartiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of food plants, taste and
flavor in the case of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of these phytochemical
chemicals that translate into flavors and
[SPEAKER_01]: smells and whether one's using cannabis
medicinally or cycle or for recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons, everything that it, that
everything that went into the,
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant's growth is manifest in,
in some ways, um, by the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that it came out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to see more cannabis grown
outside and in the sun, although I
[SPEAKER_01]: completely understand why it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why in such cases, you know,
you just need more interventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need more, more assist, um,
of plants if they're grown indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, I don't know how that's going to
ever turn, you know, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I think that's a, that's a difficult
thing because it's just not, it's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, anyway, I hope that I hope that
things can turn around on that front with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's some issues around,
uh, temperature in, in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some areas, like here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's too cold to grow it
outdoors for large portions of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, one of the things that we work
with growers on is trying to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: what a lot of people are calling living
soils, uh, with the idea being that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating these microbial interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, reusing the soil to create this
ecosystem, similar to we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors because like you mentioned,
these phytochemical reactions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going on or interactions, um, really do
have a large influence on the odor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of whatever crop you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there are some nutrients that are
tied to, to terpene expression like
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, but a lot of it is the microbial
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the, one of the interesting
statistics that I've think really shows
[SPEAKER_00]: how important that is to the plant is,
um, it's been, it's been established that
[SPEAKER_00]: something like 30% of the, uh,
of the energy that the plant takes in
[SPEAKER_00]: through photosynthesis is putting back out
through the roots as a way of fostering
[SPEAKER_00]: that microbial relationship, um,
in the form of the exudates, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's, that's amazing that
they would give up that much of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, sort of nutrients that they're taking
in just to, you know, promote this
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, you know, it makes a lot of,
it makes a lot of sense biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: because plants have this thing that no
other, no other life form has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the ability to capture
sunlight, combine it with water,
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen, and through photosynthesis make
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're some soil organism living in the
dark subterranean and, and you're on the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots of this thing that is basically a
food factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and at the same time, you're able as
a microorganism to, uh, do equally
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive chemistry with, uh,
you know, the things that are available to
[SPEAKER_01]: a microbe in the soil and then hand that
over to a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, it's, what it really does is
it, it takes sort of the, the genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of a plant and all of its
photosynthetic capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes the genomic potential of say
a bacterium and it makes this new organism
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, uh, sort of fully, fully capable
of using everything that's in the above
[SPEAKER_01]: ground environment and the below ground
environment and bring it together into
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't want to go so far as to say,
a new life form, but with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome research, that's that
conceptually at least is how people think
[SPEAKER_01]: about not just plants, but also people and
all kinds of things from the goldfish to
[SPEAKER_01]: the, to the polar bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what we see and what we think is
the life form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's what we can't see the
invisible that tells us that we are all
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of in amalgamation of a number of
different life forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that is a really different way
to think about a plant, um, a person,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't there something about how the,
uh, the majority of what, uh, the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of cells on the human body, the majority
of them are actually not human cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, microorganisms or other,
uh, other living forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you know that better than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That at one early, several years ago,
there was sort of an estimate that got out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that was inaccurate that there was
10 times as many microbial cells as human
[SPEAKER_01]: cells in the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's since been adjusted and
it's around at least at least equal
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, if not slightly more microbial
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however you look at that, if,
if you look at a person and you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, that person's half person and half
microbe, it, you know, it puts a whole new
[SPEAKER_01]: light on things like what are those
microbes doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe people should take care of their
microbes since they're a part of their
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since they do things like,
you know, they help us digest our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really interesting work is being done
around, um, sort of brain health and the
[SPEAKER_01]: gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause for example, Sarah, Sarah Townen is
a neurotransmitter and it's it helps our
[SPEAKER_01]: brain work and it affects whether we're
feeling happy or sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people had assumed for a long time,
Oh, that's Sarah Townen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be made up in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's where most of it's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in fact, most of the Sarah Townen is
made, um, in the lower reaches of our gut
[SPEAKER_01]: by our members of our, um, microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tells us that, you know,
there's some pretty fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: connections between, um, health of our
bodies, the health of our minds and what
[SPEAKER_01]: our gut microbiota are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where, much like, um,
the diet of the soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we talked about different forms of organic
matter and what the responses of a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: are to the different forms of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really our, our gut is, is very much
analogous to the root system of a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because we we've got all these microbes
living, living in our digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the lower reaches and they need
to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it turns out, all, you know,
for years and years, we've all heard,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you should eat your fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not so much as good for you as
they are the fodder that it appears feeds
[SPEAKER_01]: the, um, microbial strains and species and
communities that are the ones that churn
[SPEAKER_01]: out a huge number of compounds and
molecules that have medicinal effects in
[SPEAKER_01]: our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mentioned serotonin is one
such metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, um, another compound called
butyrate that is really important for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, colon health and also important in
sort of modulating and regulating the way
[SPEAKER_01]: our immune system works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, like the root, the root
microbiome is making things like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've mentioned the plant growth
promoting hormone, which is a good thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our microbiome is making all kinds of
compounds and molecules that have,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it's not just, there's many beneficial
effects, but you get, um, just like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you get something funky going on and
then you can have your microbiome maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: making compounds and molecules that aren't
so good for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know that across the board,
it seems that, you know, a high fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: diet, which is to say one that is an
abundance, not exclusively, but certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: an abundance of unprocessed plant foods
is, is something that our microbiome
[SPEAKER_01]: really, um, really thrives on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, it, it, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I recently heard a podcast by Paul
Stamets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was just, it was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I can send you a link to it if you
haven't heard it, but he talks about the
[SPEAKER_00]: role of a fungi and how it, it's,
it's impacts on human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certain things like lion's mane,
for example, he said there's found that
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually form new neurological
connections in your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've started taking, uh, some of his
mushroom, mushroom supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, fiance and I, and we, we feel like
they're making a difference, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of how we feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there is some research to support
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about, uh,
psychoactive mushrooms, though that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something he discusses as well in the
podcast, which is really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just the, um, normal mushrooms that
you could find in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, there are, um, it's,
it's, the whole mushroom world is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, greatly under researched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, we know, we know a bit
about, you know, phytochemical say,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, in cannabis, you know,
we know about phytochemicals in tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: or carrots and some of these things,
but thinking about the phytochemicals say
[SPEAKER_01]: from fungi, because what happens in our
gut with, with these phytochemicals that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, that are bound up, um, when we're
eating whole plants or whole, whole
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms or mushroom extracts,
I would also expect to some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that our gut microbiota get a hold of
these phytochemicals and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically they're fermenting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they ferment them, it turns it
into other bioactive compounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: products that our body knows what to do
with those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where mushrooms, a whole plant
foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to call them drugs,
but they, they can have drug like effects
[SPEAKER_01]: in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that probably goes
way, way back in human evolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: where when we were hunter gatherers,
right, all we were doing was eating wild
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes, you know, maybe you ate the
wrong thing and you were done with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but knowledge and tradition was passed
down from generation to generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, of course, all the
traditions of herbal healing come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these plants were, um, you know,
I think in some ways became a part of our
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies because people knew in those times,
okay, this plant for this ailment,
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant for this malady, we know this
plant comes up in the spring and we know
[SPEAKER_01]: this malady often comes up in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's put those two things
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is the deep roots of my plant
lust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think anybody who ventures
into, into growing a plant of some sort,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets you in touch with our relationship
to the botanical world and really how
[SPEAKER_01]: ancient, how ancient it is and how much we
need to have plants in our lives for all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of reasons, you know, from aesthetic
to medicinal to recreational to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just the amount of carbon
cycling that plants are involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're involved with on this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we, we all, I think Tad would,
would, um, do better if we got in touch
[SPEAKER_01]: with our, the roots of plant lust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond mulching, how else can we foster
the, this microbial relationship that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has with, um, it's microbiome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, you know, as much as we love
our plants and I certainly get it,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially somebody in a, in an
agricultural or cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our, our, our hands and our minds in one
way or another are all over that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want that plant to grow and we will do
anything, um, just about to get that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think our penchant for sort
of interfering with the interference isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the right word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our penchant for sort of manipulating and
managing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to, um, maybe check that
at the door more than, more than we do
[SPEAKER_01]: because the more we sort of think we're
going to one up mother nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we're going to one up, you know,
how this plant is growing invariably,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're altering, you're altering something
about, about the trajectory of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant's life and that, and the way
that that plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think stepping back and going,
okay, on the whole, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the consequences of me doing
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to get, is it going to net me
really what I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it, or might it possibly have this
downside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as I think, uh, I really think growing
plants is figuring, figuring out,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, what does this plant want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is its body primed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can I do as the grower to give it
everything it needs to let, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to let that growth occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I, I like thinking about,
um, sort of getting out of the way of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural processes, but not to the point
of, uh, just walking away from something,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being mindful about, okay,
how are my practices, how are my practices
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to help things along?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, um, I realized that
for some situations and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly one of them, you know,
I actually, I would, I would, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: almost consider cannabis to be in the same
world as bonsai, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in different places on that
continuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both highly manipulated kinds of
plants and growing environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get beautiful results in both
cases, but to just be aware that we are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end, you know, working with the
botanical world as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, trying to get the botanical
world to do things that it just really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, isn't, isn't going to be good at
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and in fact, I've done my
own share of, you know, manipulating and
[SPEAKER_01]: managing plants in my garden from the way
that I prune things from the way that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'll take a look at a plant and
if it's, if it's, if it's been sickly for
[SPEAKER_01]: too long, I don't have many plants like
this, but I've been known to pull a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: up and say, okay, I'm done with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what is ailing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've tried this and this and
this, but you're out of the garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: this just was not a good place for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also, there's also that space
of, of, of knowing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemistry and, and I don't mean that
in the, you know, synthetic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The metaphorical, I mean this in the
metaphorical chemistry sense, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemistry is just not right between
you and the soil, between me and you,
[SPEAKER_01]: between the place that I have for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're, you know, we're going to put
everybody out of their misery right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I will, I'll pull up a plant
and, and that, um, that, oh gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really hard to do though,
Tad, cause for a person with plant lust,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh no, what am I doing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the end, you know, most of the
time it actually works out okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I gained some new real estate to put
something else in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that spot that I think I've made a
better selection about how it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to, you know, that particular
setting in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to keep things moving along for
the listeners, I wanted to ask a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about your upcoming work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you and your husband, David are
working on another book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious what role cannabis might
play in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we think so, you know, not
surprisingly, after writing the hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: half of nature and actually call it,
you know, there's the dirt trilogy,
[SPEAKER_01]: hidden half of nature is the middle book
and dirt's the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then growing a revolution is the third
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's odd Tad that despite these three
books, we have not really, we've touched
[SPEAKER_01]: on, but we have not really taken a deep
dive into exploring the question of does,
[SPEAKER_01]: does soil health affect and influence
human health?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, how, what are some of those
connections and relationships?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone listening to this podcast,
anyone who talks to me will know that yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: Anne and Dave for that matter think that
there definitely are some connections,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what we want to do is dig deep into
the science and bring the story to readers
[SPEAKER_01]: in ways that are, you know, entertaining
and informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two crops as I'll call them
crops that we think it's every bit is
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: To talk about cannabis and wine grapes in
the same breath as we talk about our food
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and the connections between soil
health and human health, because wine
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes and cannabis are part of the
botanical world in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring the tissues and products that we
make from those plants into our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know they're doing things inside of
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it stands to reason then that what
is how we cultivate cannabis specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does that have to do with the quality
of the products that we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's medicinal or recreational or
what would have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, so we want to, we want to take a
look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think with cannabis, you know,
the trajectory, despite, I think what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on at the national level,
I just think cannabis is going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: legal in more and more states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think consumers ought to have
resources at hand to know how was this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to educate consumers too,
about just sort of the role of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemicals in a plant's body and how
that translates to the desired effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're looking for some kind of
couch block thing, or whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for something more clear headed,
or whether you're looking for something on
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicinal end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope in the new book to sort of
spill the beans, so to speak on that
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's terroir that you're
talking about with wine grapes or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpene expression with
cannabis, really it's a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of relationship between nutrient
content and soil health and the microbiome
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhizosphere and how all these
interact, these complex interactions are
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring that create sort of that final
plant tissue or fruit that we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're consuming ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add to that what I'm
seeing with these living soils and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from some of the growers that we
work with is higher levels of terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: than there's seen traditionally across the
same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it used to be in the medical days here
in Washington, that you would go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: store and they would just say here,
you know, this is what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be, let's just say OG Kush is
one of the names of one of the cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would just get, you would get
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't talking about the,
you know, odors and flavors of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it is what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the name sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you'll see different growers
growing the same cultivar and getting very
[SPEAKER_00]: different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before, I think it used to be more
about just THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people would get in trouble for
carrying high amounts of cannabis on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd want to carry less cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd want stronger cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could carry less of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they can get 20% THC versus
10% THC, they could carry half the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, consume half the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we're finding is
[SPEAKER_00]: as the sort of the community evolves and
as the laws change, people are more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in these terpene levels that
they're testing for and how they affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the, not only the psychoactive effects of
cannabis, but also the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, I guess I would say the recreational
process of consuming it, which is similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to wine in the way that we evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of how, when describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's really interesting
as, you know, as the industry evolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I think would be really,
really fun in the future to do is to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we have, there's cannabis,
cannabis tasting events, like the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup, I think is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's wine tasting events and
there's tomato tasting events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be great to organize an
event, not based on these crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Hey, let's have, let's have an event
about all of the wonderful edibles and
[SPEAKER_01]: quaffables from the whole botanical world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be an event on
phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, we know this tomato has,
you know, particularly high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: lycopene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasters, you know, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, also be having it the same
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the phytochemicals in,
you know, the wines?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are, what, what are we, what can we
associate with these and what about these
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemicals in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think in modern life,
we're just so disconnected from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, not only how we grow our food,
but you know, what this whole endeavor of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture is is and has been all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always about survival and getting
enough to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's obvious, but certainly at
another level, part of all of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: about, um, pleasure and it's about fun and
it's about flavor and taste and effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, being knowledgeable enough to
know, okay, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had enough of sugar or I've had
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more, no more cannabis for me or,
you know, no more wine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually think if people were more
educated about the effects of all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical foods, beverages, and so on,
um, it would be, it would, it would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I don't know, a more interesting
way to, to move our way through the world
[SPEAKER_01]: of a grocery store, a farmer's market,
um, you know, a party, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having guests over and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, there's no doubt in my
mind that humanity has long, long flocked
[SPEAKER_01]: toward, uh, you know, things like sugar
and alcohol and, um, and getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of, okay, well, let's,
let's take the pleasure from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's not overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting as someone who
works around a lot of chickens as a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, we find that they can regulate
their calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just put out egg shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, oyster shells and they will,
um, they will regulate that based on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they need 16 did,
you know, I think it's 16, 18% calcium in
[SPEAKER_00]: their diet, or maybe it's protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be confusing the two right now,
but, uh, basically you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate that for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we do the same in terms of our
own needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we crave sugary foods or salty
foods, um, based on what, what our bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, interestingly enough,
I met with, uh, Tom Wagner, who's a local
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeder, specifically known for
tomatoes and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, green zebra being one of the ones
locally here that's pretty well known that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's really interested in is
tomatoes with high protein content,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is associated with the flavor umami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've, they've found this association
between the umami flavoring and protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's perfectly purposely breeding for
tomatoes with higher umami levels as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way, or flavoring as a way of selecting
for higher protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that is really, that is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's also interesting to
me because of the ability for us as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as human beings to, um, equate flavor with
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proteins, protein's an important thing
that our bodies have and umami is a flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so voila, the two come together and
we're consuming a diet of food that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is actually good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to put you in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys might enjoy chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole, uh, I've been reading this
reading some books on, um, wine lately
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, the whole way in which I recently
learned, for example, next time,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Tad or listeners, whoever's out there,
next time you take, um, you're drinking
[SPEAKER_01]: wine, take in the equivalent of about a
teaspoon of the wine and don't immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: swallow it, but imagine it's food and kind
of chew on it and it pushes the wine into
[SPEAKER_01]: all these parts of your mouth and your,
um, sort of back of the throat area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hits, uh, taste receptors that I
didn't even knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know I had, and the wine
washes over these taste receptors and it
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes completely different than the
normal way of just sort of pulling in a
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth, you know, uh, some wine and
swallowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it, it had a completely,
uh, the flavor of the wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm like, wow, I'm actually tasting
this wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I know, I don't, it was a whole
new experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we chew on food, we are
probably hitting more, uh, taste receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: with food than we are with the things
that, um, that we drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I, I just recommend,
I recommend that to people and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find how many different flavors
there are in wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also makes me think about the
phytochemicals in wine and what,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, what's going on with them as they,
um, you know, pass through your mouth and
[SPEAKER_01]: then further on down in the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, really interesting connections
between phytochemicals, flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition, and, and, and health and
wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I know there's books out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, people have talked about, you know,
part of the purpose of, of taste
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors, um, in our body and actually
receptors in our gut as well on,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, on cells is to pick up, uh,
specifically on phytochemicals because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're interacting biochemically,
uh, with our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all kinds of ways, all kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the books I really enjoyed,
you might want to check out is called
[SPEAKER_00]: Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by a gentleman named Adam Rogers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks at the science of booze and
that's, uh, one of the, one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: he talks about is how, um, how we evaluate
wine and just how, uh, qualitative that
[SPEAKER_00]: process is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think you'll really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will send you a link to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks again for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a beautiful Seattle day that we
get so rarely here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we should get off the phone
and allow you to get back outside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out to the garden and get your hands
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that sounds good, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really, um, really enjoyed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about, as you can tell,
I like, I like, uh, microbes and soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the human body and how we're living on
this planet and can take better care of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, just to summarize your big
takeaways would be for people to,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, their gardening is to increase
their amount of organic matter in their
[SPEAKER_00]: soils in the form of mulching,
which has a bunch of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also not overdo it, allow the
plants to sort of reach their own genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential without, without pushing them
too hard in the traditional gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is there anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are, no, those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, um, that is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and I would just say one last
thing that we didn't, we didn't hit on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think about, uh, in the context of
not pushing your plants too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the organic matter is to realize that
the soil has a metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of it as a metabolism,
uh, just like our body does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overwhelming the body of soil with too
much of any one thing is what we want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, veer away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's sort of like, uh, you know,
even too much mulch, too much organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, the soil can't handle all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like sitting down to, you know,
instead of one plate at dinner,
[SPEAKER_01]: like three platefuls, you just,
you're going to feel nauseous and overfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not going to, it's just not
going to work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being mindful of the soil's ability and
the microorganisms in the soil to process
[SPEAKER_01]: that organic matter in a, in a timely
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think there's sort of like a
secret mission of the natural world is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if a gardener is paying attention to
the metabolism of their soil, it also
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps that gardener connected to the
natural world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got to be out there sort of
checking on that metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, a little too much here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we need a little more over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it, it, I think about maybe a
gardener as being more, maybe something
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a shepherd tending its flock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that our flocks are green and
stuck in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to sort of herd them along
with, uh, the things that we know about
[SPEAKER_01]: what they like and how their bodies work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I look forward to talking to you
soon and hopefully having you out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.

garden, but also in our bodies.
