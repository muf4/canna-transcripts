[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Renell Anderson.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been a speaker, panelist,
and think-take contributor for a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations, universities, and other
symposiums related to the education and
[SPEAKER_01]: advancement of biochar and sound
environmental practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: She carries the message of sustainability,
tangible methods to combining climate
[SPEAKER_01]: change, as well as the vast agricultural
and environmental benefits of the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing and implementation of
biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stays on the forefront of newest
innovations and advancements of this
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly adopted technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Renell is the founder of Black Owl Biochar
and also president of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar Initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Owl Biochar is the leader in the
industry in regards to university studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, Renell will be sharing with us
some of the ways to both make and evaluate
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of your biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In honor of our guest this week,
I'd like to offer 15% off of Black Owl
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: No coupon code needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the sale price on the website
if you go to www.kisorganics.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: search for biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great opportunity if you've been
waiting to try a high-quality biochar in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden or growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further ado, though, here's this
week's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, I'd like to start asking
you, first off, a little bit about what is
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how would you define it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you talk a little bit about its
relationship with terra preta and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that history?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar is biomass in some form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be any form of biomass,
anything from sewage sludge to,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, dead creatures to grasses
and woods that are carbonized in a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of ways it can be
carbonized, but you end up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically, a product called ash,
biochar, perhaps water, and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: bio oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very general description for
what biochar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the American Association of
Fertilizer Control Officers got in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they narrowed the definition for
agriculture and horticulture down to
[SPEAKER_00]: wood-based biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be wood that's been
thermochemically processed from being wood
[SPEAKER_00]: into being more of a charcoal-type
product, a high-carbon black
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal-looking product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to the terra preta because in
those days in South America, it took
[SPEAKER_00]: science to figure out, a long time,
why there were certain areas of real high
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and agricultural success and,
therefore, population success.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was that they had been
taking their excess biomass and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: into pits, which made them low oxygen,
and then creating these fires underground
[SPEAKER_00]: and then using that material mixed with
pottery shards that would have minerals in
[SPEAKER_00]: them and creating a really high nutrient,
high soil organic carbon soil that's
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, it kind of grows
additional soil with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fertility supported large
populations, and it's only something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really are learning about in the last
decade or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to simplify the definition,
essentially we're taking wood and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrolyzing it or heating it to a really
high temperature but with very low oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only real relationship with
terra preta is the fact that it has sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of this loose association with this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other relationship with the
wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: With South America and beyond that we're
trying to kind of replicate this using
[SPEAKER_01]: more advanced technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned from looking at what they had
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And modern agriculture has, in tilling and
the way it's been done, most of the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil has been released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the carbon stores have been
reduced by about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are dependent on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole soil ecosystem is diminished
when the carbon levels are diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enhancing the carbon levels,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: that being the most important component of
a biochar, that they learned from studying
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils, the very rich soils of the
terra preta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did you get into this exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you own a peony farm with your
husband and have been doing that for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at a photo here,
which I'll add to the podcast page that
[SPEAKER_01]: shows some of the trials that you ran
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about how you
got into biochar in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this farm and we were going to
develop the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was sort of in a natural state with
a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to do everything organically
for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But among them was that I'm allergic to a
lot of the chemistry that's used in normal
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asthma attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were going to make this an organic
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been through horticulture school,
but I read every book I could find on
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farming and every article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came across an article about biochar
and then it really sparked my interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a few months trying to run some
biochar down because this was way back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, 10, and there was no commercial
biochar, so to speak, available at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you find in terms of some of the
benefits of using biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit more about how
to tell different types of biochar and
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are just some of the general
benefits if you're using a high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer that real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to say that when we put biochar
in, we were just going off of this one
[SPEAKER_00]: article and it was a leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to get some what would not
really be considered biochar in this day
[SPEAKER_00]: and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we ended up having this bumper crop of
flowers in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're supposed to have three years of
waiting before you get a bumper crop of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got enhanced growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got hearty growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got disease prevention or suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the field inspected by the
university and they can't find any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: typical normal expected fungal diseases on
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got by with less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing was the vigor and the
speed of the plant growth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we planted that field, I
simultaneously did 150 pot randomized
[SPEAKER_00]: study that combined fertilizer and biochar
and potting soil and then with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, controls for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that potting soil and biochar
outperform potting soil and fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is there's some dependency
on the biochar to get a result like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the results were run through WSU's
statistical analysis machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found out that in every case
where biochar was used versus the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got 70 percent more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more 70 percent more biomass,
70 percent more root mass, 70 percent more
[SPEAKER_00]: blossoms and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty convincing evidence
that biochar was responsible for some very
[SPEAKER_00]: positive outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for those listeners who are not
in Washington, WSU stands for Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: State University and they are one of the
bigger agricultural colleges here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, just to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we say biochar, it has this
connotation that there's biology in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we get biochar and we're charring
this wood, there's no biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to inoculate it or charge it with
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood, the starting product that we use is
virgin wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that whatever you use is
not a treated wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to use wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big industry in chicken manure,
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high ash content thing,
but it has different properties than a
[SPEAKER_00]: wood biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agreeing that you don't want to use
treated wood, you just want pure virgin
[SPEAKER_00]: and we use the waste part of a tree like
limbs and tops and bases of harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use any trees for our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, in that the word biochar,
the bio came from it has to be made from
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass because most charcoal historically
was made from coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it's not considered biomass
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered a fossil fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomass indicates it was a living
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why you have to pre-charge it is that
when you process it, it vaporizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that turn into gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those important constituents is
the nitrogen that's held with in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and it vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up as nitrogen oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not processing it
correctly, you can add to the burden of
[SPEAKER_00]: air pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some actually multimillion
dollar processing machines out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot get past the air resources board.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, that gaseous component,
there's some carbon, there's some oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some hydrogen and nitrogen,
all that are reformed into gases and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated from the wood lignin and
hemicellulose and cellulose that survives
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of carbon, the heating
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those we burn, to run a boiler to create
energy and other machinery can create
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they finding that there's a little
bit of difficulty in getting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar product is when they are also
trying to make biofuel, which is you get
[SPEAKER_00]: three co-products from the processing of
wood like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have that final product,
then how do I prepare it for my soil or my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in our case, in full disclosure,
we use your product, the Black Owl biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: in our biochar soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're soaking it in fish hydrolysate
for a few days prior to mixing it into our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mix as a way to buffer some of the
high carbon in the biochar and also lower
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the pH, which we'll talk about
here in a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where are you finding a lot of people
are using to inoculate that biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: because as I understand it, if I were to
take raw biochar and stick it right onto a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil with a plant, it could potentially
pull some of those nutrients because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the high carbon exchange capacity from
that soil or be more efficient at
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing them than the plant could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly nitrogen that you find
out because when you do the same studies
[SPEAKER_00]: with mixing like sand and wood chips and
biochar, not adding any nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a nitrogen fixing plant, you don't
see any slow down or competition for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically pre-charging it needs to
be adding back nitrogen, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take a lot to offset it because you can do
it with compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with organic fertilizers
that are low, you know, in numerically
[SPEAKER_00]: low, like a 222.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the crop that you're trying
to grow and a lot of people pre-charge it
[SPEAKER_00]: with compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thought there is that you want to know
what the compost is, but typically that's
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to pre-charge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish is really high nitrogen quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I would say is that,
you know, this product, incompletely
[SPEAKER_00]: cooked or are charged that have tar
formation in the process, that recondenses
[SPEAKER_00]: on the char, those chars tend to be a
little oily and they're hydrophobic or
[SPEAKER_00]: they will not take on water or take on
liquid substances well and actually they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours is hydrophilic, it likes water,
it will absorb water and any liquid that
[SPEAKER_00]: you put with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that becomes part of the particle then
and is retained by the particle and is
[SPEAKER_00]: available for plant use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so just to be clear, backing up
really quick, we can charge biochar with
[SPEAKER_01]: just about anything including compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fish you said was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I know some permaculture guys
that are, they're peeing on their biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way to add nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like there's a lot of ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also run compost tea through it,
sort of like a sieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and compost tea, the interesting
thing about it, we make a product like
[SPEAKER_00]: that but, and it's fairly popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will lower the pH as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost anything, almost anything that
you're gonna mix it with has a lower pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compost, fish fertilizer and most
organic fertilizers on the market if you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually were to get their pH is there
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a balancing of the pH though I
wanna say something really quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a difference in the kinetics or
the speed and the amount of cation
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange with biochars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of ours, if you didn't
pre-charge it but you put it in a system
[SPEAKER_00]: with a dry fertilizer and the soil that
you're gonna plant in, it's kinetics for
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbing the minerals that are needed
happens really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you come to equilibrium in the soil
real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once it's satisfied itself for
oxygen and nitrogen, it's willing to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it all back to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chars that take a lot longer to do that
transaction are pulling for a longer time
[SPEAKER_00]: and aren't able to give it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a unique, I think to our char that
it reacts so quickly but in the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: scope of things, what you're trying to do
is make sure that you have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients necessary for the plant there
simultaneously with the char if not
[SPEAKER_00]: infused into the char itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you brought up that there is a
difference in quality with biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all products are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the same issues in the compost tea
industry in terms of claims that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are making and a variety of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I'd like to talk
about first before we get into the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: tests, which I think are really important
is you'd given me some general ways for a
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener or homeowner to test biochar just
on the surface level.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you talked about was
whether or not it floated in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you expand on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's gonna float on water only like
if it has oils or tars attached to it or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's undercooked because like wood
chips will float in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's oils that if this product can
be processed in several types of machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: and if it happens to be a long tube as
this product goes down the long tube,
[SPEAKER_00]: those gases can reform into tars and they
actually end up on the char itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big tests is does it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it leave a film on your fingers?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you wanna avoid because
actually those tars can be, it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk about leaving some
residue on your fingers, I know when I
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up your biochar and frankly that's
really the only biochar I have experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with is it looks like I have charcoal on
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not oily per se but it will leave
residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not saying no residue,
you're saying no oily residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the oiliness that is of concern and
that because it's oily, it will float if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a poor char.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the quick easy test for a home
gardener or a grower would be to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: small amount, put it in a container of
water and see if it floats or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's one test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will eliminate the potential toxicity
of oils and tars which you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So should it sink immediately to the
bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should it stay a little bit suspended in
the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will some of it float and some of it sink?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be an expectation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to have it take it on fairly
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That again is how porous is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, minerals are heavier and they
will sink first and fastest and they look
[SPEAKER_00]: very much like char.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrolysis minerals which are not the
carbon fraction that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so important in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will sink really fast there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're talking about biochar
quality and we talked about it floating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there other ways you can evaluate
biochar besides the floating test at home
[SPEAKER_01]: without looking at lab tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll talk about that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard, I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people who are speakers who are
quote unquote experts who have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarity with these products and I have
had them come up and had what would be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered just ash next to medium-grade
biochar next to very high-grade biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: and said they all cost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the problems in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know some of them people that
should be carrying the most knowledge will
[SPEAKER_00]: point to the whole ash pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really tell by looking at it
and that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, you know, I think people think ash is
gray and people think also that that
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar is what they take out of their
fireplaces residue which is it's ash what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking out of their fireplace and
the reason they're getting a good response
[SPEAKER_00]: from that is because of the calcium,
magnesium and potassium that that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's also raising the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of where the pH never comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of biochar that's
commercially made your your ash is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be gray or white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you can't tell for the most part
just looking at you need to do a lab test.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question that brought up before the
lab test was particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you do remediation work and some
other things around with the biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we be looking for in terms of
particle size as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: The particle size depends on what you're
trying to achieve because if what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to achieve is better drainage in
the soil or actually if what you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve if you have a sandy soil and
what you want is more aggregation you need
[SPEAKER_00]: a different bulk of the particles to be
larger, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they will actually help the soil
perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the other case they they're forming
soil aggregates in the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the small particles the real small
ones are actually eaten by worms if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a field where there's worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worms will eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually grow amazingly large
themselves but they excrete this clear
[SPEAKER_00]: gluey substance that that helps with the
tilthiness of a sandy soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there and then of course then
they're moving around and they're creating
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow and oxygen so they like to eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would the smaller particle size be
better in terms of the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity or the ability of microbes to
process some of the the biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be faster acting in terms of the
plant growth and health we would see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily, but it it's true like
when when we very first started working
[SPEAKER_00]: with this people would say, but we've
tested all this, they would say our
[SPEAKER_00]: largest particles aren't terribly large
they're like four millimeter particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it goes down to microns in size
and I like that diversity of particle size
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got different functions
from the different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do screen it for particular
purposes and there's some groups of folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that want only the large and some groups
of folks that want only the the small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would expect with a typical biochar
that the smaller the particle size the
[SPEAKER_00]: more surface area you would have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And surface areas everything with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly ours is so porous and
it's so it has so much surface area that
[SPEAKER_00]: grinding it into a smaller unit does not
really increase the surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's that much like the
catacombs you know it's just it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: so porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particle size in our case doesn't
really work like that but the general
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption would be like if you were
making it at home and you have those
[SPEAKER_00]: larger chunks grinding those down which
should make for more surface area and then
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore you get more of the transactions
that you want in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into these lab tests and
I'll post these on the podcast page for
[SPEAKER_01]: people that want to see them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll we'll talk about this right now
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have these two tests looking at two
different samples of biochar and the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to have you point out some of
the more important figures on the test as
[SPEAKER_01]: a comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really the only way to
effectively compare biochar as I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it is in order to compare
apples to apples is to actually look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the first one on here is moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what the
differences in numbers and what we should
[SPEAKER_01]: look for as optimal ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say this first this bottom
half where there where they're showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is required if you want to get
organic certification by any state or or
[SPEAKER_00]: or Omri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put biochar on the soil you can't
get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore these people that have
created products with tars and negative
[SPEAKER_00]: things they the producers have run into
legal problems because you can't get it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can potentially although this is
rare but you do want to know what the what
[SPEAKER_00]: your biochar consists of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this heavy metal section down here
shows you if you're low on heavy metals or
[SPEAKER_00]: in this one report we had fairly high
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you showed me one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah you have three samples here and on
one sample it looks like you range from
[SPEAKER_01]: one point five all the way up to 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point four and this is in PPM as it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a fairly big range in terms of
what what we're looking at in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic and some of these other heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you're suggesting that
people look at heavy metal content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important aspect to make
sure you're not bringing anything into
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles things like spinach they mistake
cadmium for calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot of calcium and everybody
tells you eat spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get calcium but if there's a lot of
cadmium in your char the plant or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil anyway which there is in California
quite a bit of cadmium in the soil plant
[SPEAKER_00]: will uptake it and you'll end up eating
it's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first rule of thumb is do
no harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is indicative of just what you're
getting for your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy biochar you're you're
buying water carbon and ash and in some
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we found is you've got to be
really careful about your water sourcing
[SPEAKER_00]: because that water can be the place from
which this copper or lead or arsenic is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these reports that are produced about
the heavy metals the moisture can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: source of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most producers produce biochar comes out
of the kiln super hot 500 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that Celsius or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they do is they put industrial
water on it to to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very hard for them to create a
char that doesn't have about 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture is like 50 percent on this
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is on that one but we
have found a way to bring it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kiln dry cool and what water we add back
in is there is a desipresent and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: water that we we track the the purity of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so just to give listeners a range
here the the black oak biochar has about
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 percent moisture content and the the
other ones that I'm looking at here are
[SPEAKER_01]: range from 48 percent to 52 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting about 25 percent more
water which means you're getting I assume
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 percent less product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though another biochar may be less
expensive or if they're comparably priced
[SPEAKER_01]: you may not be getting as much of the
actual biochar which is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good number to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this 23 is us moistening this because
the biochar that we make inherently comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out what what they consider bone dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that bone dry there are some
hydrogen and oxygen gases trapped in the
[SPEAKER_00]: particle and they will come together under
the right circumstances and form 10
[SPEAKER_00]: percent water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a good thing because for
transportation you want it to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of moisture content because
it's a lot less flammable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get up to this water weighs
so much more than biochar that while a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of of it is is water it makes
the transportation of these heavy watered
[SPEAKER_00]: chars much more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on here it looks like you're
you've highlighted the total ash content
[SPEAKER_01]: and it looks like the range between these
three tests go from let's see 34 down to
[SPEAKER_01]: four point seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you you'd said you want a low
ash low total ash number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain why and what that tells us
about the combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that means that if you if there's
three components water carbon and ash low
[SPEAKER_00]: ash content ash is it's not necessarily a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some of our products we add it back
in and I'll get to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just generally speaking the reason you
want biochar is for the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the carbon the organic stable organic
carbon does in the soil for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere for the whole ecosystem down
there and replacing that carbon that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been lost is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of chemistry that goes
on that we never think about and
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry that's related to that
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the carbon content the more
valuable the biochar is to the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ash can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that he when they put it as
carbonates this is a liming value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to buy biochar and use it
to lime your soil a high ash content is OK
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does seem like an expensive way to
approach liming a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium carbonate is really cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get egg lime for nothing compared
to the cost of biochar or other products.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one down here that you point
out was this butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what does the A.C.T.
[SPEAKER_01]: stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butane activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does that signify.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to determine the surface area
using this butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activity test or several approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this lab is sort of the standard in
the industry and they use butane activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how much butane gas absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know under the heated up they put in
the dry char and they see how much butane
[SPEAKER_00]: gas disappears because it's correlated to
the surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mathematical equation that
brings you to surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And properties of the char is what that
number shows us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only it also in a way it ends up being the
surface area correlations based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: butane activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can get there other ways like with
electronic microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the ordinary lab test that
that a non-university lab would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The university labs can get down to not
just what the estimated surface area is
[SPEAKER_00]: but what the actual surface area is and
also what part of that surface area comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from macro pores micro pores and meso
pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the transactions that happen
with biochar including the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: you know all the interactions with the
soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're turning soil minerals into more
useful or more usable forms with the
[SPEAKER_00]: addition of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much surface area is available to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much surface area is available to hold
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much surface area is available to hold
nutrients because biochar does it by
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption more than absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means sticking to the surface of
the particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a high surface area means you
have a high efficiency in the product that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I usually describe biochar as a sort
of a giant sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a really strong ability to
retain nutrients in the in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: then release them to the plant as the
plant needs them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing living soils if you are
farming if it's if you're reusing your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mix it's really great to have biochar
in there for those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an OK way to describe it or is
there something you would say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's very good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put up some photos too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are seeing about 8 to 10 percent better
growth and yield with our biochar soil
[SPEAKER_01]: over our water only soil and that the only
difference there in the recipe being the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of the biochar that we're soaking
in the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really happy with the quality of the
biochar and also that the growth that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to move on from the test because
they're a little dry but I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important that people take a look at these
numbers and actually compare what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting because the term biochar is
synonymous as you've said with so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that we don't really know
what we're buying and what we're applying
[SPEAKER_01]: to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it requires some education on the part
of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah let's move on though and talk about
some other questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What research is being done right now with
black owl biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've talked to me off air saying
that you've been doing some some work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you is there anything you can you can
talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we work we work with a lot of
universities and some of the work is egg
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Purdue just Washington State
Montana State and usually we ask for the
[SPEAKER_00]: results and we have yet to get back
anything that's we're embarrassed about or
[SPEAKER_00]: unhappy about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana State just sent us some results
that they got with grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got 40 percent more harvestable
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was wheat and with the use of
biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how they were using the
biochar in that study or in that trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really but I know it was a field
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it wasn't a pot study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a field study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Purdue had 40 to 60 percent better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they've been working with it for
about three years and different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell was able to overcome a problem in
their tomato high tunnel using it because
[SPEAKER_00]: the phosphorus didn't lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess phosphorus locking is an issue and
I think it may be an issue in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too because you because the way I
understand it a lot of growers go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and add these nutrients and then they wash
them out because they're ready for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: move on to the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what biochar does is make that
phosphorus available but it doesn't lock
[SPEAKER_00]: it into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this washing notion is probably
eliminated as necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah phosphorus doesn't it's it's very
immobile in soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't leach out like other nutrients
like nitrogen would but it I think what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're referencing is how available it is
which I believe is I believe it's P205
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what you're talking about in
terms of phosphorus that the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like there's some some good
research being done using biochar and then
[SPEAKER_01]: also I know you do projects on the
remediation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are people how other what are other
ways people are using biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay well we found that it will water
remediation and filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is activated carbon
substitute in some cases is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: activated carbon and about the tenth the
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found with our char and this is
it's funny the overlap between remediation
[SPEAKER_00]: and ag science because some of the things
like the kinetics the speed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction are really important because like
in water remediation they found that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know typically it takes 24 hours for a
biochar to filter out the heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: like copper and zinc which are really
prevalent in the water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes two minutes for ours to filter it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is you need a lot less of
it a lot smaller bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make these gigantic swimming pool
treatment areas with other products and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can cut that footprint down it's a lot
less expensive for the industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing and then it has a
natural affinity for a lot of these heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals but not the so much the anion ones
which would be selenium and arsenic and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just talk about selenium and arsenic
right now but we are able we are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a coating net right now to put on
that biochar and still get that real
[SPEAKER_00]: speedy reaction time but have it attract
the arsenics and so and the anion problem
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really good at oil, oils,
petrochemicals and that has some bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: on restoring fields that have been damaged
by some of this stuff making land usable
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell me a little bit then about
what makes black owl unique what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: your biochar different than say some of
these other ones on the market besides the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that you're fully you know pyrolyzing
the material you have the lab tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: the university research to support what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that really
separates you in your eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we're kind of and working on we've
done several publications where we've
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed out this kinetic thing which is
really really important that also if a
[SPEAKER_00]: biochars got enough how am I going to say
this oh it's understandable it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: charge to it it's a negative charge and
that charge the strength of that charges
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important because the scientists
are theorizing that that's what stimulates
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants growth hormones and why in part
that you're getting fast or maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also get compost to mature faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In stimulating the growth hormones it's
also making the plants larger and the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields larger so it's a standout in the
forces and you know that magnetic charge
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is they're speculating there's more
than one school of thought on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain this but they think it's what's
communicating underneath the soil with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi which like it the beneficial fungi
but the negative molds gray black and
[SPEAKER_00]: white are getting their communication
systems messed up so the plants have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better resistance to those molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how what kind of research have you seen
with biochar and mycorrhizal fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh well quite a bit and actually I brought
one picture down to show how good the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encourages it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seeing a symbiotic relationship
there?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what levels are you recommending for
people to use biochar in potting soils or
[SPEAKER_01]: in fields to see results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay well I just want to say one thing
about potting soils and compost we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of landscapers who come and get the
biochar to put in the compost because
[SPEAKER_00]: people round up and some of these
herbicides and pesticides survive the
[SPEAKER_00]: composting process so they put the biochar
in there and it has a natural affinity to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that so that when they use that
composted product they know that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to inhibit the growth of the
plants that they have just put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds it within the biochar particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't allow it to be uptaken by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same research on E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and enterococcus too by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where does it go exactly then if it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck in the particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know microbes do come and degrade
that stuff in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but at least it doesn't cause a compost
to crash a new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put it in there as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what rates are you seeing people using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so the rate that's why this carbon
number is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we use five percent by volume in a
container and get excellent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond 15 with ours would not be good but
I call our biochar a high efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar because it is holds more water
holds more nutrients works faster and has
[SPEAKER_00]: this high carbon and high surface area
that its orders of magnitude higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: these these other chars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need less of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high efficiency char.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five percent ten percent is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a person wants to go that far with it
and 15 percent is max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell did a really interesting bunch of
studies where they they kept adding salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salts are a problem from synthetic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're residual in the soil and they
impede the growth of plants in future
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Cornell took these plants and they
put our biochar in some of them and not
[SPEAKER_00]: and other biochars and some of them and no
biochar in some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept putting on briny water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt water and you know all the controls
died and the and these were soybeans which
[SPEAKER_00]: are sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soybeans in our biochar went to full
maturity and created new soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they increase the
brininess continuously to try to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: upper level it would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may not be a common situation but
it's fairly common in the California
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a good buffering capacity was
what you're saying for sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people that are say doing you
mentioned synthetic chemicals or ionic
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing that people use are using
biochar with salt based fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we have people using just every
imaginable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that we've been
criticized for is having white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you sell a biochar that it's just
biochar and you're not adding this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the other thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we do do that if somebody wants us to
do it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is is because everybody has
their own unique thing that they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do and products that they like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think just give him a really good
high quality chart to add to whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet have we had anybody say that gave
them a bad result.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using biochar in a living soil
like let's say a raised bed for example
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have it in there at well with
ourselves we're like 8 to 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often would you reamend that bed with
biochar or would you ever re inoculated or
[SPEAKER_01]: would you just assume that for the next
year or two it's probably going to be at
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal levels or what are your thoughts
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it in there at 8 to 10 percent
I don't think you need to do anything more
[SPEAKER_00]: for the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly it should be there and it kind of
it kind of grows and multiplies and also
[SPEAKER_00]: it speeds up the formation of humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had apple growers over in Wenatchee
use it and they called up and they could
[SPEAKER_00]: just put humic acid in that biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because a year later they have
their agronomist doing the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah and nature intended carbon to be
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up an interesting question
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I was getting my soil labels
made I was told that I had to put virgin
[SPEAKER_01]: forest slash on my ingredient list for the
black owl biochar and that sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible to me when I first read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just those three words together
didn't sound like it was a good ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: solution and then you sort of explained to
me a little bit about what that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just review that a little bit
for listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen there are a lot of slash
piles of around even in our neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: now where they've taken down trees because
they're clearing to do more building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well they they let those piles build up
and dry and then they ignite them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the typical slash where you know
harvest tree in the forest or outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burn those things that well in a
commercial tree operation in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: private forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they can get a forest
certification and that means for every
[SPEAKER_00]: tree that's been pulling a lot of carbon
out of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those that they take they have
to plant like five trees to replace it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the growth of those trees they're
pulling more carbon out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would never recommend harvesting trees
for making biochar but there is this waste
[SPEAKER_00]: that's called slash which are the limbs
that they can't turn into two by fours
[SPEAKER_00]: right and the tops that they can't turn
into two by fours and the bases which they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't turn into two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things in most forestry
operations are left in the forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One if they don't end up being tender for
a forest fire what they do do is degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: over a period of time the microbes come in
and they're just releasing all that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide up into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that stuff and convert it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what virgin meaning it's never been
treated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest means came from a forest and slash
means it's otherwise waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so essentially it's a byproduct of
the logging or forestry industry and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a way of sequestering that carbon into a
usable byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking a waste stream and
actually making it more ecological by
[SPEAKER_01]: making this biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful which makes me want to
switch gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as as you know because we've talked
about this my father after retiring was
[SPEAKER_01]: got really into biochar and started he
bought a kontiki kiln or built one and was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking into how to take this technology
into poor countries and villages and as a
[SPEAKER_01]: way of raising soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was looking into China and he took a
few trips over there before getting ill
[SPEAKER_01]: himself and was working with them but then
he was also working with the Oregon some
[SPEAKER_01]: forestry people down in Oregon as a way
for these kilns to be something they could
[SPEAKER_01]: take on to site and then as they're doing
the cuttings or the harvesting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: timber industry they could then take this
slash and put it right into the kilns
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrolyze it right there on site and then
apply that material back onto the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there any do you have any thoughts
on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really good idea however
you know it you've got to manage that
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and you have to you know take
several hours in a kontiki kiln and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's a good idea it would be nice to
have really good pyrolysis units that are
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: However we found that bringing it out of
the forest on the logging trucks
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves didn't add to the pollution so
our way of doing it is to take it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest and then process it and
therefore we can use the energy that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we can create energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I love the idea of taking a byproduct
like this or a waste stream and making it
[SPEAKER_01]: into something that adds fertility and I
know my dad was really excited about that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process in terms of how he could
utilize that in you know recreate this and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some villages out in China and other
places in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in terms I mean I have a kontiki kiln
on our property but I still choose to use
[SPEAKER_01]: your biochar because I can't produce it in
a quantity that makes it cost effective
[SPEAKER_01]: for me and like you said it is a lot of
time but I do love the idea of being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to hopefully encourage the forestry
industry to start considering biochar as a
[SPEAKER_01]: viable option rather than slash and burn
and you know some of these other things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other question I had along those lines
though I know my dad initially when he
[SPEAKER_01]: started looking to biochar he took a class
to make a biochar stove and then he came
[SPEAKER_01]: back and showed it to me and this was he
was first getting into it and and we
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at it or like this isn't actually
pyrolysis material you're making ash
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially you might as well just go put
this in your fireplace for probably what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have any recommendations for
people on a small scale who say wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: try making their own biochar I've seen
people digging pits I've seen a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different designs is there
anything you can recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of stuff there's another
Dr. Teelid whose actual name is Paul
[SPEAKER_00]: Anderson I mean he he makes a cook stove
you put the wood and this is really meant
[SPEAKER_00]: for villagers in there and you really
control how much oxygen is burning that
[SPEAKER_00]: fire they're using the heat to cook on and
then they take that little bit of material
[SPEAKER_00]: out and throw it on their garden and it
works well I've seen these some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have cans that go into their wood-burning
stove and while the wood-burning stove is
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing up gases into the atmosphere at
least what they have in the can is low to
[SPEAKER_00]: no oxygen and so it actually will retain
the carbon and as long as they don't cook
[SPEAKER_00]: it too long you need to look at pyrolysis
a lot like baking you're baking you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to bake it rather than burn it there's a
million different models of product and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they've made some larger units
that they're taking out into the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing that can utilize the heat or
the energy and and unfortunately I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about the Contiki kiln
because that's a basic thing that as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're there to suppress it at the
right time you can get biochar from it it
[SPEAKER_00]: works and I liked your dad's unit because
it could take fairly large limbs and work
[SPEAKER_00]: with them because a lot of people don't
have chipped wood to work with so that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is practical and inexpensive what I
don't like is this mid-tier group of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are put on wheels that don't
use the heat and energy and do create tars
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end so knowing a little bit about
the engineering but this can all be
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated from a lab report so I think
with any big outlay of capital for
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery a person should always use get
their own feedstock that they anticipate
[SPEAKER_00]: using have a load run and and then pay for
a test to see what kind of result they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting yeah I just think we have two
different types of listeners here
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially is a lot of people that want
to make it themselves you know just for
[SPEAKER_01]: their home garden or home grow you know
really small scale just to try it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and it may not be the highest
quality biochar but it's not going to hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants and they want to you know
give it a shot nothing dangerous and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have other people on a commercial
scale that say hey I have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar companies out there and they're
all trying to sell me product and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: make different claims how do I evaluate
them and that's where that lab test I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is really important yeah I was
talking about if you're buying equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: and in you and you're putting some big
dollars into equipment because like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the forest model the Contiki
kiln makes a lot of sense some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery that's been drug out into the
forest is $300,000 machinery okay before
[SPEAKER_00]: you do that get it a lab test is what I my
strong recommendation sure and there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different configurations vertical
horizontal gasification as as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrolysis which just means there may be
some airflow or some people put oxygen in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it depends on you know what
you're trying to achieve in the end but
[SPEAKER_00]: for a home gardener I think a Contiki kiln
is a good thing for a third world country
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a cook stoves a good thing it
depends on how portable you need it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: but with any of these things if you do it
right you can you can end up making some
[SPEAKER_00]: very good carbon even Boy Scouts can do it
with campfires just want it to burn from
[SPEAKER_01]: the top down not the bottom up I'll have
to get some links or resources to put on
[SPEAKER_01]: the page from you after this talk this got
me thinking and this is going to be kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a silly question for you but something
that I know I've seen online is people
[SPEAKER_01]: think of biochar and they go okay well why
can't I just go get some charcoal
[SPEAKER_01]: briquettes and pound those up and add that
to my soil or pulling out of a fireplace
[SPEAKER_01]: or things like that so I know we talked
about a little bit but can you just
[SPEAKER_01]: reiterate again any potential dangers
there what the major difference is besides
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon to ash ratio right okay so
charcoal in a bag is made to be an energy
[SPEAKER_00]: source to cook food its purpose is to be a
source of energy like coal for instance
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's charcoal usually it's made from
wood but it also has binders in it that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives it the shape that it is I and
sometimes they put accelerants in that
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal but in any case it's not a nice
pure carbon product to enhance the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: its whole purpose is different and there's
a lot of unknowns about it that are of
[SPEAKER_01]: concern to agronomists so there could be
other things in that charcoal briquette
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be safe for you you don't
know you don't know what it's made of you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to it's supposedly you don't
need to know but you know there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: some some criticism in the health field
about charred meats cooked on a char coal
[SPEAKER_00]: grill and you know all of this stuff when
you heat something up you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: reformation of chemistry and you can end
up with things like dioxins and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just not good so with the charcoal
briquettes they're not they are not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in substitution for actual biochar
and did we we did go into the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to be at least 60 percent
carbon I don't know if we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: that from the test results but you know
the combustion what you're doing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grill with charcoal too is they're doing
full combustion has all air coming in on
[SPEAKER_00]: it right and what you end up with is a
gray ash you're burning up what carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: in there but it could be wood it could be
torrified wood that serves as that
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal and so that HC ratio would not be
a good number for plants for for optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: stability in the soil so okay so the
hydrogen to carbon ratio is a reflection
[SPEAKER_01]: of how stable that product is as in how
long the the carbon will stay in a form
[SPEAKER_01]: that will allow it to remain in the soil
is what you're saying right and not
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade so you probably find that the
degradation rates of a charcoal that are
[SPEAKER_00]: meant for a barbecue are much faster I
think that you'd find the absorption is
[SPEAKER_01]: much lower and much lower cation exchange
capacity yeah which is its ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: retain nutrients okay well was there
anything else you wanted to cover talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about biochar do you feel like we got a
good foundation there for people to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what biochar is you know I just
want to say this you can't there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of magical thinking around biochar and you
won't believe it till you see it I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you really experience it turns you into a
believer if you end up with a good product
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other hand you know buyer beware
with like just like anything else so
[SPEAKER_01]: source a good high quality biochar and
then try out a plant or five plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: and use scientific methods so make sure
you have a control so the only difference
[SPEAKER_01]: is the addition of biochar versus your
other the rest of your crop and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for yourself is what you're
saying try it out that's right use
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever fertilizer you would use
otherwise and put you know some biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and see if you don't have a better
experience with one plant over another
[SPEAKER_01]: great well thanks for your time today I
