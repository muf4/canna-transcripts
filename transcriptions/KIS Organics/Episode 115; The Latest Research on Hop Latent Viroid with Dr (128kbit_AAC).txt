[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Dr. Jack Munz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Munz has a decade's worth of
experience in the field of plant molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, working on complex gene
regulation, and nutrient metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obtained a Bachelor of Science in
Botany from Colorado State University
[SPEAKER_01]: while working as a lab assistant
facilitating the development of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: markers for invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack then earned a Master of Science from
Illinois State University where he worked
[SPEAKER_01]: towards increasing vegetable oils and
temperate grasses like corn for biodiesel
[SPEAKER_01]: production using targeted gene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: He then earned his PhD in Botany from the
University of British Columbia during
[SPEAKER_01]: which he worked to unravel the genetic
regulation of nitrogen starvation
[SPEAKER_01]: responses in plants with next-gen
sequencing technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Munz is a lead scientist at Genie Labs
and head of pathogen testing, research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could give listeners a little
background into your personal history and
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Rivers biotech, why don't we start
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is plant molecular
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing this for over 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on a number of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working undergrad at Colorado
State Botany and then went into genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: projects working on biodiesel and genetic
engineering of crops for biofuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during that, just a wealth of genetic
techniques that I learned, finished my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: at University of British Columbia and then
took on a job with Three Rivers biotech to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop genetic diagnostic tools for
cannabis pathogens, pathogens in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to sort of genotyping of
cultivars for sort of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: identification purposes for our tissue
culture programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Three Rivers biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been operating now for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lapsed in Canada and Washington
and California for tissue culture and for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lab in Washington just across
the border from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm based out of Canada myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sort of guide and go down there and
do testing for pathogens there as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what pathogens we test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main one's hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we can also test for 11 other
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are generic viruses to just
sort of broad range agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition to that, we do test
for broad range fungal and bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: infections such as pythium, infusarium,
botrytis, sort of those really big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the heavy hitters in the
agriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have a variety of different
testing that we have available for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's been very busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's sort of the where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the tissue culture
goes, we provide storage and cleanup of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten the timelines really down
to a shorter window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're willing, we can get plants back
out in about three months, best case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the price has gone down substantially,
too, because tissue culture is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gotten it to be more amenable to
a market that is fast moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've been working with you and
offering your pathogen testing for over a
[SPEAKER_01]: year now, maybe like a year and a half,
I would guess off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been going really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the feedback we've gotten has been
really positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a good friend of mine, Justin McGill
over at Mako Farms is now doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to clean up some of his genetics
while he does a quick farm reset here with
[SPEAKER_01]: the LCB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be able to offer those
as well through KISS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to being able to
have those things available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's just dive right into this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do want to touch a little bit on some
other viruses that you do test for and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of your other testing protocols and
what folks can look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main point of this podcast was
because I recently attended that webinar
[SPEAKER_01]: that Dr. Poonja put on, Dr. Zameer Poonja,
who's doing really the cutting edge in
[SPEAKER_01]: research, it appears, on hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he worked with you guys in conjunction
with you guys on some of this with the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about that relationship
really quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, I think it's like two and a
half years ago, we connected with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poonja at a conference here in British
Columbia, an agricultural one that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on some hemp and cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been working in the field of
cannabis and hemp for a while now,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly a lot of publications on Fusarium,
Empithium, some of the Botrytis,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he's been out there in the field
with growers, just saw sort of how
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread some of this hoplite and viroid
might actually be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started testing at a few big
cultivations that he collaborates with and
[SPEAKER_00]: just networks that he knows to sort of see
the extent of the problem a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it just sort of snowballed
downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took off as he realized that we know not
enough about this viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how it spreads, don't know
the stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he took it and just ran with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as the academic side goes,
he's just a wonderful resource of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what we've done with him is
really high throughput, large screens to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a handle on spread, which is
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within a big facility, how is it
spreading?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting some big numbers on that
kind of thing, testing different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both working with Dr. Prunja and also a
nursery in Oregon, we were basically
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at different parts of the plant to
see where hoplite and viroid actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: most prevalent and found that it is much,
much higher in the roots than anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the main takeaways is just
that testing leaves and stems is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a lot of false negatives and
testing roots is about four times more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking around 80, 85% of the time,
you can get to detect a positive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, whereas you're only detecting
positives in the leaves and stems about 25
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly when you're talking about
a latent viroid, and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do more than one test to really prove a
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having only a 25 to 30% hit rate in a
known infected plant is just way too low
[SPEAKER_00]: to really get you ahead of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's you're always playing catch
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's one of the main aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, then the spread, we did water
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I've been developing
too, is being able to filter water systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and test viroid in circulating water
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did find that the hoplite and
viroid can be detected in recirculating
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can lead to infections that are
on that same flood table or anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of interesting findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the root thing is relatively new in the
last, what, year or so, would you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that research has shown?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if a grower suspects they may have
hoplite and viroid, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended sampling and testing protocol
to really determine infection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conducted those studies,
both here in Canada and in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was August, I think, is when a lot of
that testing was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sort of released some of those
findings in September-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it is relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, it's strongly,
I always strongly recommend testing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as testing protocols go,
the type of root you need is not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need like a central thick root
that's coming off of the root crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fibrous roots around plant pots
are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small root samples are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as testing protocols go,
if you're able to take a small snip from
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple parts around the plant,
that can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even with roots, there's still
some false negatives where it's just not
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, it's about 85% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always recommend multiple tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Brunjo would recommend three
negative tests in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the constraints of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend a minimum of two and
spread those out, you know, three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spreading them out, what that does is
if it is a latent infection, like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: newer infection, a few weeks is time for
that viral load to sort of increase to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where it's easier to detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, those plants,
if you do suspect an infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: should be quarantined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be sharing water sources with
other plants that you know are negative
[SPEAKER_00]: and certainly not in production rooms
until you know that they're negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you could be spreading it
without knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the testing protocols,
small bits of roots from around the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: if possible, or, you know, multiple tests,
always multiple tests that are negative to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that you're getting a negative and
always roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's just really no point in
testing leaves and stems now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the one other point that I
mentioned is that I have some preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: data in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young plants are also not a great place to
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took cuttings from positive moms,
rooted them, and then tested every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first month, in a positive
cutting even, the detection goes away for
[SPEAKER_00]: that first month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes back two, three months
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that right after cloning is a terrible
time to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to test your old moms before you
do your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And teens, when you're trying to select
new moms, teens before you up pot to big
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two critical moments that you
can get a better representative sample of
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're positive or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much root mass do you need to
actually do a sample or a test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, our testing, we're talking about
a centimeter of fibrous roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual mass, if you were to weigh
it on a scale, about 100 milligrams is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the upper limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very small amount of tissues needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these molecular amplification tests,
too much sample can actually overload it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have too much genetic material
in a reaction, a PCR reaction or a LAMP
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction, it'll actually cause it to fail,
especially in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of junk cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant material is more challenging than
humans or animal material to extract RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: from because of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex mixture of pectins and
carbohydrates and lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goop can really interfere with
PCR and other methods of nucleic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sample size is better if it's in
that smaller range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we need very little amount of
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want it, you know, if you can take
it from the periphery of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: just be as least invasive as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I mean, if you're able to
take samples from around the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get a better sort of
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take like a centimeter from
around the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum we would suggest is maybe five
centimeters of thin roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beyond that, if it's beyond that,
it can cause a reaction to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't like to, but if we have to,
we have to pull some of the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like to pull a sample out,
but preferably not, because we like to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everything in one tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my next question was if we send
you too much in a sample, you will adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: it appropriately for a better result,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, sometimes I'll flag it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's a, you know, it's it's
really, really a headache to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the sample volume because we have
to do it in a controlled fashion that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, you know, I can't risk it
contaminating anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to take it to a separate bench
and it's a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we receive samples, we can turn
around results to you within 24 to 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours during business days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that timeline can get really thrown
off if I have to adjust samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, you know, one time I can do
it, but it's it's not something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would basically just say,
I'll send you new test kits and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have to send you samples because it's it
really throws a monkey wrench into the
[SPEAKER_00]: works to have samples that are too large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the sample, like I said,
it can cause failure in the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that were to happen, I can then
dilute the sample and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the small I mean, we're talking a
small sample of a centimeter is millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those cells presumably has
millions of copies of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really, really, really sensitive
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's in the sample, we will find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sampling from around the plant is more
if it's a newer infection and it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: present in one side of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have plants that are
sharing or touching at all, then perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: one side may have a viral load in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've tried pooling samples and I
usually don't see an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not I don't miss results because of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss it more from biological reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not in the sample yet,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we recommend multiple tests
spaced three weeks apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a better way to go than pooling
samples because comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it when we did the full study of
all testing, all the different root types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also compared pooling versus single
samples and increase percent of positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe one out of hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a pooled sample that tested
positive that missed maybe a single sample
[SPEAKER_00]: would have missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's more one of those things I
suggest that people are really worried and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to send, you know, a
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to if you just send a
single sample, you're not going to miss it
[SPEAKER_00]: really either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more important is multiple tests spaced
out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more important than a pooled
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had mentioned mother plants and
fresh clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at a slide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I I screenshot a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slides from the presentation from the
webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have notes to go off of with
you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first slides in the
presentation says symptoms on mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, with the note being that most
mother plants are asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the man, this viroid is such a pain in
the neck because oftentimes it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reasons we don't have an exact
trigger for why symptoms sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: manifest or why disease is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an area that Dr. Poonja is
actively researching as to why there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger between latent symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So asymptomatic and a disease dotted
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The some of the possibilities would be
changes in photoperiod might trigger a
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental stresses might trigger a
proliferation in the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most facilities are, you know,
the growers have been growing for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really great at grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their plants are super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have some reasons as why it's
asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times is that the plants are
super healthy and so they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: manifesting symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until we know what that trigger is,
I can't say for sure why some are diseased
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there does appear to be a combination
of genotype and environmental conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that when together can cause a
manifestation of dudding, loss of potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological changes, you know,
stunting, all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear that environment plus
genotype play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some genopiotypes may be more
susceptible to that trigger, that switch,
[SPEAKER_00]: which stands to reason, especially if it
does end up being a photoperiod response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, different cultivars have
different, you know, different genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: have different responses to flowering and
photoperiod So, yeah, we're still trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to find more answers on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is certainly most a lot of the time
there are a lot of asymptomatic
[SPEAKER_00]: infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of an eye opening moment
when we were doing these early studies
[SPEAKER_00]: with large scale facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, oh, wow, there's a lot
more here than we realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anecdotally, I would say from the
facilities that we work with that have
[SPEAKER_01]: done testing that have known infections
and because a lot of our guys are running
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're reusing the soil, which creates
more challenges around this viroid for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're able to have a really good run
where they don't have a lot of abiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses, you know, just healthy plants
that they're able to keep happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't see it really express itself as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would fit sort of with what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question around that is,
so if we have, say, a positive infection
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have a plant in a room that we know
is infected, what are the chances then
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can't assume that the rest of the
plants in the room are clean because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not expressing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, unfortunately, it's no different
than any other, you know, viral outbreak
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you think there's been close
contact and those plants have to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: go into a quarantine mode where you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to know is molecular testing,
especially when it's asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with symptoms expressing to rule
out, you know, any other cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular testing is the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no way to walk into a
facility, look at a plant, say that's for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, without a doubt, you know,
hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to know is testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in that situation where you have
a positive plant and you have other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really anywhere in that room
facility, you know, grow just in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they were cloned, same cutting
table, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of, you know, you have to contact
trace essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, the only way to know is
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of, yeah, it's pernicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's and it's a very stable
viroid, too, so it actually can last on
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another area of study that Dr.
Poonj has been working on is just how
[SPEAKER_00]: stable is this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not uncommon for viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just by their nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these small RNAs that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single stranded circular RNA,
but it forms a complex where it binds with
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically is this really tight
organization that it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade both by all the normal things that
degrade viruses and DNA in general and RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surprisingly stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the unfortunate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unfortunate reality of viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's touch on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the recent research shows that
heat is not a treatment option with this
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, so we're still working through
that on hoplite and viroids specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of, you know, what I look to when
I get sort of rough numbers, is something
[SPEAKER_00]: like potato spindle tuber viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, potato tuber spindle viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get those two mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the well-known viroids that
has had a lot of studies on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think, the first one that was
identified back in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't until molecular genetics
techniques caught up that they were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to detect what a viroid actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So viroids in general, we're finding more
now that we have more genetics tools to
[SPEAKER_00]: find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that viroid, potato tuber spindle
viroid, they have shown they have x-grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: like really, really high resolution
electron micrographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microscopes that can see at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you heat up the viroid, that tight
structure it forms, it does start to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a circle at around 70 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some opportunities to make it
more susceptible to degradation at really
[SPEAKER_00]: high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to actually just degrade it,
just bar none, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer infectious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, heat is not looking to be super
applicable, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I mean, like, you know,
at certain temperatures it can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose its form.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of us stuck with an imperial
system, 70 Celsius converts to 158 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, which is a really tough
temperature to reach in a lot of grow
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safely and with HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just want to throw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more it's more applicable to
like recirculating water systems where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could heat that water up to a really high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, some of it still might get
through because it's not it's maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: losing its structure temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it cools back down,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was more of a when we were
thinking about that with some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, it was more directed towards
recirculating water and how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize it coming back through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's going to be it's going to be
a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other other options are 20 percent
bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 percent bleach, Vercon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How well do you oxidizers work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrogen peroxide based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so again, working through this stuff
and Dr. Punja has more probably hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and specific information that he's going
to release when he's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, what I can tell you is,
is he knows that Vercon S, so 2 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: Vercon S is the most effective and that
tracks with other viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2 percent Vercon S is the most
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up would probably be 10 percent
bleach for three to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, obviously bleach stinks and
it corrodes your your your pruning tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend bleach because it's just
something that everybody knows and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically, you know,
it's pretty standard to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleach 10 percent at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's, you know, Dr. Punja's
recommendation, then, yeah, it might it
[SPEAKER_00]: might take 20 percent to really be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the top two.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 percent Vercon S and then 10 percent
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sort of hydrogen peroxide based
and ethanol based alcohol based stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, those are less effective for or
less effective for viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, going back to potato,
tuber, spindle, viroid, they didn't find
[SPEAKER_00]: that those to be particularly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that would probably track
with hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structurally, all the viroids have a
similar structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just naked RNA that forms a little
circular structure that forms a little
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary sequence that has bumps in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But structurally, they're all very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the effect of the efficacy
of some of those oxidizers and hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide based, you know, Sanidate kind of
things, ethanol based ones, the efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be lower than Vercon S and
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that data will probably be out later
this year from from Dr. Punja's lab so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can actually have like numbers on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to mention just quickly is
bleach, even if you so so in potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: tuber, spindle, viroid, if you bleach for
30 seconds, it's no longer infectious,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were still able to detect it with
with PCR techniques from those swabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can make it no longer infectious,
but on surfaces, you could still probably
[SPEAKER_00]: detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, all we care about is,
is it infecting more plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, those would be the top two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using things like Sanidate and
stuff, they may help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not going to be 100%
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, I mean, some of
these other ones like bleach probably
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to be 100% effective on
sterilizing seeds either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to get stuff come
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how transmissible is this viroid with
pruning tools, handling of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, onto clothing, things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of things as small,
I just assume it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do we move through a facility as
safely as possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to feel like it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too worried about it as far as
like gentle touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clothes and walking through facilities
and handling of plants, the
[SPEAKER_00]: transmissibility is going to be low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airborne, there's no evidence of it being
airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main ones is sap contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have if you're if you're being
rough with the plants and something breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's there's sort of that contact,
that's highly transmissible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just gentle touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're if you're sterilizing your
pruning tools, if you're switching pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: tools between cultivars or genotypes,
that is low level of transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the main areas to focus on
is just the infected clones from infected
[SPEAKER_00]: moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a mom's infected, you should just
assume all the clones are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I had mentioned, the roots are the
best place to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found some in the very large scale
study, we had six positive moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took a bunch of clones from those
and we tested the cuttings of those clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cuttings came back negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now leaves and stems having less thyroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we rooted those and tested those
for six months every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them did stay negative for
those six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't necessarily mean they
won't come back positive eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm trying to get at here is that
you can suppress, you know, if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from a mom that will appear
negative at first and then perhaps many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many months later, you can probably get a
harvest through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe, you know, maybe the next
generation of clones, it comes up positive
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main methods is just
positive clone or clones from a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds, there is seed transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I used to when I was when we
were first sort of trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: the transmissibility, we were looking at
hops and hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also seed transmissible levels are
very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seemed like it might be a viable
option to get away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seed transmission in cannabis is
somewhere between five to 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big, you know, that's still an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, the infected sap on
contaminated pruning tools is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're if you're doing trimming,
if you're doing active work with those
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, you got to sterilize between
preferably if you had a separate set,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could sterilize sort of
longer instead of just a dunk and then
[SPEAKER_00]: move to the next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just sort of the gentle touching is
not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other main transmissible way is,
you know, like I said, the water
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're sharing the same table and
those roots are in the same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, nutrient medium, that is
definitely a way that you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess really an area that
should be very sterile is your cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: tables and benches like wherever you're
working on those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have infected clones from an
infected mom and you're doing work on that
[SPEAKER_00]: bench, that whole surface could be a
potential place that you could transmit to
[SPEAKER_00]: another another set of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an area just to be really
careful of is is cracks between tables
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working on for anything where
you're cutting plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm understanding correctly,
I could buy seeds or get seeds in to my
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could look the mother plant could
look clean, that plant, those seeds could
[SPEAKER_01]: look clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second cycle, I can't make it
all the way through flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I clone off that plant down
the road, I could still get hop late in my
[SPEAKER_01]: road potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a tough one we're still
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the long term, those really long
term projects are difficult because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have sterility, like really,
really tight sterility in a lab facility
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long period of time to get like,
this came from this seed, without a doubt,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no horizontal transmission from
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those studies are challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is that seed
transmission is is is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five to 30%, we are getting
transmission through seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try and surface sterilize,
but it's likely transmitted via so in
[SPEAKER_00]: hops, it's transmitted via pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet for cannabis,
if it's just pollen, or if it's pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: egg cells, but it's in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumably, we're still working on those
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the as far as the detection,
so if you take that seed, you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: into your facility, you pop them,
you grow them, definitely should be
[SPEAKER_00]: testing those those those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer they're at least a month
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another area where there might be
we might be missing things when they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: that young seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the hop latent can basically
hide from detection, like we've sampled a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that specific stage of development in
a plant is it seems to be able to suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid and it's not until it's older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then really pivotal would be if you're
cloning, you know, once you have a mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ready to make the next generation
of moms from that, that's a really pivotal
[SPEAKER_00]: place to test those roots of that mom,
I would expect to show I would expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the hop latent at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not, you know, it would show up
in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the data to say that that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would caution people against
thinking that they're in the clear as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as they tested that mom, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they never need a test again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's setting yourself up
for heartbreak later if you if if if stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: starts coming back positive, you know,
in a generation or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a completely different system,
but lettuce, chlorosis virus in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the symptoms don't manifest
until the next generation of that mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in a peer reviewed publication
where they saw more severe symptoms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: following generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the verdict still out on hop latent as
far as does it get more severe?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the more generations you go,
all we can do at this point is test them
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're old enough to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that's about a month to two
months old to that teenage stage before
[SPEAKER_00]: you up to mom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great place to test them and then
test before you know, a week before you
[SPEAKER_00]: clone that mom test the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those are sort of the two benchmark
places that that working with with
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, that sort of seems to be a good
place to check to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very least, you'll know that that
next generation should be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you gave us some numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also looking at another slide from
Dr. Poonj's presentation on some work with
[SPEAKER_01]: Tumi Genomics that showed positive females
crossed with a negative male, meaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: the females had hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the infection rate was 31 out of 71
seedlings, which is about 43, 44 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: infection rate that varied from mother to
mother from 23 to 53 percent with the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid present on the seed coat and inside
the seed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty high transmission rate,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yours was a little bit lower,
but still a fairly high rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's something growers should
be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's teasing apart two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because the seed coat,
that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was talking about transmission,
we're talking about sort of inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, the actual seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sterilize the seed coat,
hopefully you wouldn't get that
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's pretty high for seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're this would be a reason to
sterilize outside of the seed coat as a
[SPEAKER_01]: way of reducing.
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds before you before you pop those
seeds, 10 percent bleach, three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to try and sterilize anything
that's on the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may still I mean, that can't be 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be certain that that's 100
percent effective of getting everything on
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that should at the very least lower
that that transmission rate from just
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are residual from the mom
plant just on the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up another topic I wanted
to discuss with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea of viral load, I know that
just from everything we've been learning
[SPEAKER_01]: with Covid and how viruses work,
I know with this particular viroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're able to lower the load,
the amount of viroid present, is there any
[SPEAKER_01]: research to show that the effects on the
plant may be lower with a lower viral
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid load than, you know, another plant,
for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to say a plant's infected doesn't
really speak to what level of infection we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the level of infection definitely would
correlate with typically correlates with
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, higher viral loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, so this goes back to sort of that
genotype environment thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of where we're trying to
learn more about various genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they more susceptible to higher loads
of virus or viroid and the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What triggers cause that proliferation of
the viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that's present, the more likely
you're going to get symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically the way that this is
likely affecting the plant is the sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: of the viroid is matching a sequence of
genes that are being turned on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those two things match,
it can get targeted for degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically turning off genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more the viroid is present,
the more likely is to turn off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes that result in some of those
symptoms of stunting and reduced potency
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, viral load should correlate with
disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what kind of data we have,
it's somewhat somewhat limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we do our testing,
it's not going to be fully quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get quantitative results,
you have to purify, like highly purify the
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA and then you have to quantify the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things cost money, making it not
really affordable for just the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if you have the viroid,
you have a viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's low, high, it doesn't really
matter as far as what your next steps are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be of getting rid of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quantification of some of these
things, I've sort of left that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more on the academic side of things
rather than robust testing methods for
[SPEAKER_00]: clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, as far as the quantity of the
viroid, it will correlate with disease
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think of it more of viral load or
viroid management because in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these facilities that we work with,
it doesn't necessarily feel realistic to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and completely eradicate it or if
that's even possible, especially because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the growers that we work with are
reusing their media, which adds a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: other layer of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for example, at Mako Farms,
they're growing in these soil beds that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not leaving the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we know it's in that flowering room,
in that soil, in that media, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going anywhere, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's more about management at that
point, unless they want to replace all the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or do something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a lot of growers, that may not be
realistic or practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that led me to what sort of cultural
practices can we adopt to reduce viral
[SPEAKER_01]: load, such things as removing as much root
mass when we go to harvest as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: versus leaving that root mass in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that potentially reduce the amount
of viroid present in that media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using living soil and you want
those nutrients back, in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: most certainly, the more we learn about
management practices, certain genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be more resistant to actually
seeing the disease symptoms, the more we
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about environmental triggers,
those are obviously going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for those grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as trying to maintain the same
media, the same soils, I would agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: you that removing root mass is probably
one of the best steps you can take,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the more root mass there,
the more viroid that's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that is one very practical step
that you could take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate because obviously you'd
like to keep sort of some of that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it's really all you can
do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as those kind of management
practices, removing the infected material
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you know,
I mean, there's not, as far as suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: actual transmission, suppressing actual
proliferation, there's nothing that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: of at this moment that could prevent,
you know, the transmission to a new round
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants in that media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back, you know, the heat
treatment is not applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I don't know how else
you would be able to sterilize that media
[SPEAKER_00]: or just prevent infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as management practices,
I think, yeah, maybe the only practical
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you can do is remove some of that
root mass after those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then starting with clean genetics,
you know, when you reset, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can, if you're able to reset and
just starting things are clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as natural transmission,
we're still working on some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, you know, I mean, so presumably,
insects that have piercing and sucking
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth parts, you know, thrips and aphids
potentially could spread hoplatant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where they would get that from,
if you have a, you know, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, it's all clean stock, that is still
an unknown, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where hoplatant viral would maybe be
introduced naturally or outside is still
[SPEAKER_00]: not something we have data on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you started with a, you know,
if you're doing living soil, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: with clean stock, start with clean media,
and then you'll be, hopefully you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe for a while, because I don't know of
how else you'd introduce it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's- Well, let's just say we know we
get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I keep throwing my buddy Justin
under the bus in this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's been the best case for us of
working through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we know we have clean stock,
because we tested, and we know we have
[SPEAKER_01]: clean mothers, we know we have an infected
flower room where those beds have media
[SPEAKER_01]: that had active, you know, had viroid in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a great way to reduce viral
load on the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing they're coming in clean,
they're only going to have 55 days of
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to this viroid and potentially
less of an impact on our final crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, is where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going back to a previous study that
we had done where we took cuttings off of
[SPEAKER_00]: a positive mom, and those cuttings stayed
positive for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think only one or two came back
positive later after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go in with clean stock,
it'll stay clean for that harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that 55 day harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some get infected, but it would be
minimal as far as what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're going in with clean
stock, even if it's going into that
[SPEAKER_00]: infected soil, while they may get
infected, they may not show symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that viral load is correlated with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as management practices,
if you're able to, yeah, if that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: practical solution for you, yes,
that would help reduce the viral load and
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent symptoms and bad harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would want to be careful then when
we're harvesting not to go back through
[SPEAKER_01]: any vegetative spaces or have any contact
with contaminated vegetative plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: to reduce that potentially circling
around, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that not a huge risk in your eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK, so if you're, I just need to
make sure I understand the question
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're planning on making a new
generation of plants from that set.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so plants coming into the flower room
are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they're in the flower room,
let's say they're now infected or dirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to make sure that that harvest is
going out a separate way, not coming back
[SPEAKER_01]: through our veg space or our cloning
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just people should have SOPs around
that, making sure that we're keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: things as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be good for any viroid or
pathogen or pest in general, just as best
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so keeping that chain moving one
direction, even with cured dried flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it should not ever come back to
those earlier stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we haven't really talked
about in this podcast, I know we've
[SPEAKER_01]: covered it in prior podcasts and most
people are aware of this, but we probably
[SPEAKER_01]: should just go over what some of the more
common symptoms are with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to start it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can add on anything that because
there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the loose buds, OK, so we'll start with
flower because that's really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's sort of one of the
hallmarks is the dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have flower at all,
I mean, that's the worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then loose flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often it's called larpy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not nice tight, not nice tight flowers,
smaller yields often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Dr. Poonja has found that that
apical branch sometimes I have smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and sometimes the secondary branches
will have one that looks more normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it affects the plant earlier and you
get full on stunting, then the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: apical branch will start to basically slow
growth and the side branches will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get sort of a trident looking plant
or candelabra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of lateral growth, brittle stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just walk by and hit one and it
just flops off the plant, that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: serious symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's a hallmark of hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some correlation with leaf
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing some interesting leaf
phenotypes that I had not previously known
[SPEAKER_00]: as associated with hoplatent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have yellow, yellow leaves
towards the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main one is your COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if you have asymptomatic plants,
but your COAs are dropping, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest by harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can also be a sign that
something's going on regarding hoplatent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the potency, the reduction in potency,
it can be severe, you know, it can be like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 percent or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kind of things are all hallmarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some anecdotal ones, some poor rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in clones, if you're getting really
poor rooting, that can actually be a
[SPEAKER_00]: symptom that we've noticed given where
we're finding the viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really too surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of that can actually be seen early
in when you're rooting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those would be probably the main
ones that come to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all the ones that I had from the
presentation I was going to add to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think you nailed them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one other thing would be that you may
also have increased susceptibility if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a hoplatent positive plant to other
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, Dr. Poonj has been in
the field of cannabis and hemp and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: other pathogens, mind you, and different
crops too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specific to his research in cannabis
and hemp, fungal pathogens, he is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide expert on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he has found is that there is an
increased susceptibility to things like
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium and other root pathogens when you
have a hoplatent viral infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sort of can spiral out of control,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is pretty sort of a general
rule that when the plants are diseased
[SPEAKER_00]: with one thing, it kind of leaves them
susceptible to other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just sort of, you know,
it can only fight so many things at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to bring this into it, but there is
some evidence, and we don't have this in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis yet, but there is some evidence
that these viroids, specifically hop-stunt
[SPEAKER_00]: viroids and a few other viroids,
can actually replicate in some fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like fusarium, and then they can
actually horizontally transmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have that as evidence for
cannabis yet, so I really want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that big disclaimer is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some very interesting
research going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, there's 33 viroid species
out in the world that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three of them have been shown to
have horizontal transmission with various
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any data for hoplatent on
that yet, but it is an interesting sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, natural transmission
possibility that these things could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be replicated in a fungi and just
kept alive in a fungi and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transmitted horizontally that way,
which would be not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a fun way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure there's going to be more
research coming out sooner than later,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is such a devastating
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do hope to get Dr. Poonja on the
show eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just been really busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know you're in contact with him,
and you did a virtual introduction for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, while we're,
you know, until we get more research,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you covered that all pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other viruses are you really seeing
or other pathogens as being more prevalent
[SPEAKER_01]: in your lab with the testing that you're
doing in cannabis specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so we do really broad range
pathogen detection as far as viruses are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things that affect a lot of crops,
you know, the mosaics like alfalfa and
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber mosaic and tomato mosaic,
those aren't that common.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find those very rarely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can infect cannabis, but typically I
only recommend those on a case by case
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main ones that are more more prevalent
would be beet curly top virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's more outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Poonja Nachapa at Colorado State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great research on beet curly top
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The southwest is where the natural
transmission vector overwinters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's beet leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically they overwinter in like New
Mexico, and then they travel up into
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's outdoor grows really susceptible
to be curly top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it as far I have seen in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beet sugar beets are affected by beet
curly top in Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beet curly top the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three different strains of beet
curly top and it can range in severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the symptoms can be a little different
depending on what type of strain you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I saw was really twisted
growth, swollen leaf veins and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: pulls down like there's a drawstring in it
and the branches curl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the symptoms can be really stark on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may only affect one part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant it was like one branch was
all curled and then everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can detect beet curly top
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is one to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that one I don't think the
data so far says it's not mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a DNA based plant virus, which is the
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plant viruses are RNA based.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA based plant viruses only account for
about 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that its life cycle needs it
doesn't mechanically transfer well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's not as big of a,
you know, a spread problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoor grows should be worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce chlorosis virus is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, lettuce chlorosis virus was
identified in lettuce in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was found in cannabis facility and
a really well done peer reviewed article,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in 2017 or 2019 from I believe
was Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they have symptoms of chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellow plants produce the yield
stunting typical with most viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stunting is kind of a common theme,
weird morphology things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those would be the two that I think a
lot of people look to test for beet curly
[SPEAKER_00]: top lettuce chlorosis virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, no symptoms have been correlated
with tobacco mosaic virus, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, you might go on online
forums and people might suggest that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the peer reviewed articles and it's an
old one, admittedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the studies where they've infected
cannabis, there's no symptoms for tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic cannabis cryptic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name implies that it actually doesn't
do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cryptic, we give that to viruses that
it's there, but it doesn't actually cause
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people might tell you cannabis cryptic
is an issue, we can test for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there's no strong correlation
with that and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a really good also peer
reviewed article on cannabis cryptic virus
[SPEAKER_00]: done, I want to say 2019 2020,
where they sort of they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out the cause of what appeared to
be hemp streak, I think it was or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic, it was either hemp streak or hemp
mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp streak virus and hemp mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't actually we don't know what
those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just symptoms that have been
seen on plants that have been then given a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease name, but no one's ever figured
out what the disease is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one's figured out the cause for
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went looking for the cause of hemp
streak.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they found was cannabis cryptic virus,
and it didn't correlate like every time
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't correlate with symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they would see it with symptoms,
sometimes without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we know it now, cannabis cryptic
doesn't cause symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say that we won't find some
correlation later, maybe with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one we can test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, no symptoms from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that are really, you know,
hop latent far and away, be curly top if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have symptoms that are reminiscent,
lettuce sclerosis, those would be the main
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one more that I don't want to
get too far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to I don't want to be
alarmist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis mitovirus one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been testing a lot of samples in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a sort of a figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really prevalent, really,
really prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking on the scale of,
you know, it's probably similar prevalence
[SPEAKER_00]: to something as like hop late in the
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is one that we don't think
at this moment, there's no evidence to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it causes symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis mitovirus, it's a virus that
proliferates in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitoviruses in general are sort of an
emerging research area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the research this is one
of those things that we started finding
[SPEAKER_00]: now that we have all these next gen
sequencing technologies and we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: assemble these tiny genomes from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been finding more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research is very early and not just
cannabis like all mitoviruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research is pretty early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that has any sort of
empirical data is one that affects quinoa
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't find symptoms, but they they
have found a correlation with increased
[SPEAKER_00]: immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are more ready to to to
fight off other infections because it
[SPEAKER_00]: primes the immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis mitovirus is probably prevalent
in a lot of cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of now, we don't think it causes
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we correlate some symptom with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of now, it's not something I'm like
going out there and telling people,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, they got a test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the lay of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The generic viruses are less common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, it's hop late and far and
away is the one you need to be worried
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be curly top for outdoor grows,
lettuce, chlorosis, intermittently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis mitovirus one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not something you need to test
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just probably there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Poonja gave some prevalence numbers,
but I don't want to misspeak because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't I didn't write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember seeing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's seen it around 90 percent of the
samples he's looked at have cannabis
mitovirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing more two thirds ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but these are probably differences in
sampling at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking for hot laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I blame prevalence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are so I sort of think of
facilities because once a facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: infected, it's sort of you got to make
sure that your facility is clean and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So facilities are saying it in like 90
percent of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember what Dr. Poonja's
numbers are on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one I don't want to I don't want
to say off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prevalence is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for us, we're seeing it in like 90
percent of facilities and the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not seeing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might just be because they're
not sampling enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a few plants here and it's not
sort of a robust testing strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's highly prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the number on cultivars,
I don't have that off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't remember either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he threw out like the
percentage in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was infected and it was that he
suspected was infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was I remember it was over 50
percent because I was shocked by how high
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to misspeak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it appears to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's see, that's why I like to think
of it as facilities, because, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, but two, it's like if you were to
say, OK, 50 percent of cultivars in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: have it or America or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many facilities is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once it's in a facility,
it can be transmitted to all, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be transmitted to your cultivars
very quickly if you don't have good
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the numbers can be a little
bit outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it is a very large number,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that tracks over 50 tracks,
because once it's in a facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually widespread, especially
considering the data on how it spreads is
[SPEAKER_00]: only just now sort of getting ironed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks may have been unwittingly
knowing, you know, transmitting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed, bringing seed, thinking it's
clean, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably greater than 50
percent of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I wanted to just go back to
was you mentioned with the hemp or campus
[SPEAKER_01]: like the leaf, the streaking, you don't
know what causes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that at all related to irrigation or
are those two totally separate things or
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably separate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably separate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp streak virus and hemp mosaic virus
are things that have been around decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have just sort of called it that
without it basically manifests like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that looks like a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp streak has chevron like check marks
on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typical of something like the
streak viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a name we give to ones that have
sort of a chevron shaped streak in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the main host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tobacco streak virus in tobacco gives a
little chevron streak on the on the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and mosaic typical mosaic symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen if you've looked at,
you know, online forums with people who
[SPEAKER_00]: say they may have tobacco mosaic virus,
that's a mosaic symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of morphologies that were associated
with hemp streak and hemp mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't know what causes those,
whether or not that's actually viral or we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be one of these other
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, they didn't have the
techniques to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sort of just gave it a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as variegation goes, there could be
things that look similar to a mosaic based
[SPEAKER_00]: on a variegation, like sort of a somatic
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then is looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But variegation, when I think of it,
sort of like, you know, if somebody sends
[SPEAKER_00]: me a leaf that's like half white and half
green, like that's a really clear sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: variegated leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not that's just typical sort of
mutation that happens over, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a plant that may have
that kind of split pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not correlated then with any
particular virus or viroid that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the normal genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just a normal genetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to clone off that,
you might actually get clones that look
[SPEAKER_00]: variegated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just a somatic mutation,
which means like a cell that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive cell that has a mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every so often, these things are going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older things are, you know,
the older we get, the more somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations we accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, one of those may cause cancer
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, this is just a normal process,
especially when you're cloning and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in these high growth situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, yeah, there might be a leaf or
even a plant that just doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of those, you know,
I mean, yeah, it's not likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, last question then, since you brought
it up, sort of like mutation over time
[SPEAKER_01]: with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people talk about genetic drift with
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm under the impression that's not really
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about maybe you may get some
small mutations that may manifest over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this idea of moving a plant
outdoors to sort of revitalize the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on both of those really
quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the first one is the phrase genetic
drift has been thrown out a lot and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular contest is not used
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in when I was in grad
school, I was teaching every single
[SPEAKER_00]: semester in first year genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always a tough concept because it
sounds it sounds like it has a it sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like something like genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drifting away from something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift actually refers to natural
populations and random mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by random chance, you may randomly
drift towards one phenotype just by random
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's genetic drift is sort of in in
natural populations where there's no it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not it's not random.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got random mating and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it meets all the criteria of the
natural population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a genetic drift one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not what we're dealing with with
that clonal stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like like let's just say let's let's
give an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we had a population of gorillas and
one gorilla had larger ears, they may that
[SPEAKER_01]: pole population may drift towards having
larger ears just based on random mating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that genetic drift then what you're
saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that one particular trait may
become more prevalent over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On exams, that was always a fun one to
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure I understood it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain assumptions that are met
out in the world that, yeah, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift is actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these sort of artificial scenarios
where we're doing artificial mating and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're cloning and things like that,
it's not applicable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we are talking about is that is
that you have a genetic you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype that had a reliable phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, that phenotype is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of what we're trying to to
discuss when we talk when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about that in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is over time, you may get
mutations that accumulate within that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you clone off that plant,
the next generation may have those slight
[SPEAKER_00]: variations.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's because it's clonal,
everything coming off that plant is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that subsequent generations,
these things are going to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get more and more of these
somatic mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only affects it if you take a clone off
of that mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that mutation happened early in
that next mom's development with every all
[SPEAKER_00]: those cells that grow from it,
are going to have that mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer you go, the more likely
that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer I live, the more mutations I'm
going to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is, especially now,
the other this part, the next part,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stickier part of that is that we our
DNA replication mechanisms get worse over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it introduces more mutations with
clonal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have I don't actually know the
answer is that whether or not those
[SPEAKER_00]: replication mechanisms start to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent generations or not,
I think that they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't actually know the answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the issues is that if you
have over time, if you have mutations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are occurring in the replication DNA,
then you're going to get more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be less able to proofread
those errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The error rate for different organisms,
it's like one in a trillion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare because there's proofreading
mechanisms in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happens because we're dividing
trillions of cells to make a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lots of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's over time how you're
accumulating these these changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part about resetting outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I mean, I should probably preface
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all speculation on my part because
I don't have the data to go off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of this where you have a
genetic that's no longer performing the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people put it outside to try and
see if that resets some of what you used
[SPEAKER_00]: to love about that culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that something epigenetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are modifications that are
triggered by various environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that something like that
could be reintroduced if you put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have any data to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people who take a plant that's
underperforming, grow it outside for a
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, bring it back in or whatever,
and it performs better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to do that, I would recommend
testing and make sure that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: putting something outside, getting a
pathogen, bring it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to quarantine it when it
comes back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that there's nothing
pathogenic that you brought back in from
[SPEAKER_00]: going outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't rule out that being a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no reason to suggest that that
wouldn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if people say it helps,
maybe it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some possible genetic
mechanisms that could potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just so I understand what you're
saying, you're saying it's possible that
[SPEAKER_01]: by moving a plant outside, maybe exposure
to sunlight is something to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: photobiology, something to do with the
microbiology interacting with the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: could potentially unlock something in
those genetics that wasn't being unlocked
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of a dumbing down way of
saying what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's potentially,
I mean, yeah, so different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the light one I think is
interesting because full spectrum light,
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod changes, those, you know,
those, I mean, I know photoperiod changes
[SPEAKER_00]: do involve epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some non-heritable changes in
gene expression that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, is it complicated, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those issues that I just
don't have, you know, the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a complicated phenomenon to begin
with, but then to try and to try and say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know one way or the other,
I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it works for people, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of where I'm at with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, when we put a plant through tissue
culture and it comes back out,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes it is a much healthier version
of what that genetic used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be cleaning up, you know,
just some unknown, you know, some
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying pathogen or cause like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be putting it into tissue
culture, elicits some sort of epigenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: change and it comes back out and it's
healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my own personal experience,
going through TC does help reset that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have said that going outdoors and
coming back can help reset that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no reason to say that that,
I have no evidence to say the contrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exact mechanisms for why,
I don't know, but it could have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with something like a non-heritable
change, like epigenetics, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical modifications of the genome that
makes certain genes more or less likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: be turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of epigenetics in a nutshell,
there are some that are heritable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of them are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, for real, last question then,
because I had one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any known cultivars or genotypes
that are resistant to hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: at this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, I do not have that,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's data to show some level of
resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, across a variety of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and there's also a recent,
there's a white page by Medicinal Genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: end of last year where they looked at the
structure of hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had mentioned earlier that the way
that it causes symptoms or the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we, the leading hypothesis for why it
causes symptoms is that part of the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: is a match for genes in the cannabis
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say a match, it's sort of like
the mirror image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those two things come together,
they form a double-stranded RNA that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can basically change gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Medicinal Genomics then also
looked for is cultivars that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different version of those genes
so that it wasn't such a good match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the disease wouldn't manifest as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound out, it's not resistant to
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still would be infected, but it would
be more resistant to the adverse effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for something like this,
I think that's more likely a path forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with viroids is they're so
darn tiny that once they're in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and they start replicating,
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenge is how does the plant
actually degrade it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some perhaps genetic
engineering methods that you could do to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically have a plant ready to target
that for degradation, but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna find something that's
resistant to the infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we might find is something
that's resistant to the symptoms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably more likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have they done in the hops community
to deal with hoplite and viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up until recently, they didn't think
that hoplite and viroid caused any
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think recent studies have found that it
decreases some of the aromatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we're seeing a decrease in the
cannabinoids, THC, and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think recent studies have found
decreases in those desirable chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds of hop cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But previously, they hadn't really thought
it was a big problem, so they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing a whole heck of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things they do to prevent
having... So when you have the material
[SPEAKER_00]: lying around, you've got facilities full
of hop cones and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and binds, and when you destroy the binds,
some of the things they're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic digestion at high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes back to that, how hot do you
need to go to get viroid to get
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did show degradation of hoplite and
viroid at 70 Celsius, but it took days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also an anaerobic...
[SPEAKER_00]: Digestion, so they have enzymes in there
that are helping degrade some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same things we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more preventative than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting rid of stocks that have
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a different viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're more concerned about
hop-stunt viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that one has been shown to be
transmitted by aphids, goats, a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hop-stunt viroid is probably their
major concern, I think, more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they've learned more about the
cone thing, that maybe hoplite would be
[SPEAKER_00]: more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, testing, clean stocks,
and I guess replacing whenever they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to, because those grow from rhizomes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of having to dig those up
and replace them whenever you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really the same issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, viroids cannot be... There's
nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pesticide or spray you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get rid of a viroid as it stands now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't expect there to be one just
because of how these things operate,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the reality is clean stocks
and preventative measures are your best
[SPEAKER_00]: tool against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on that note, I really appreciate
your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot and I think that was
really helpful to get that information out
[SPEAKER_01]: to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
