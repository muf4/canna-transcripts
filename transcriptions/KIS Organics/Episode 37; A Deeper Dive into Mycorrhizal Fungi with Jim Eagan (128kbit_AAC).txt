[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little while since the last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to let you know that I've been
busy with some other projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also tracking down some new and
exciting guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really great podcasts lined up
in the coming month, including one with
[SPEAKER_01]: Allison Justice of Outco to help dispel
some of the myths that have been floating
[SPEAKER_01]: around the cannabis cultivation industry
for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we've already done some
podcasts discussing mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: including one with Jeff Lowenfels that I
suggest you check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do this interview though,
to get a different perspective on
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi from someone who has
been involved in the industry and selling
[SPEAKER_01]: and using it for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my opinions based on the research
I've seen regarding topics like using a
[SPEAKER_01]: single species versus diverse species of
endomycorrhizal fungi, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of trichoderma to these mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Jim Egan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim has been working for Plant Revolution
for more than a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having been the first company to bring
mycorrhizal inoculants to commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, he and the company have been
spreading the good news of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil to gardeners, landscapers,
and farmers all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: His degree in environmental studies his
work in the permaculture community,
[SPEAKER_01]: and his experience running a small farm
form a background that has given him a
[SPEAKER_01]: deep understanding of the importance of
soil organisms for plant and ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: He continues to learn and explore the
fascinating worlds of food production,
[SPEAKER_01]: native ecosystems, and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks, Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks, Dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start off and dive right in
talking about mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked about it with previous
guests, but can you just give us a brief
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction into what mycorrhizae is for
people that may be new to the subject
[SPEAKER_01]: before we dive into the little tougher
questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, mycorrhizae means fungus
root, and it's a very important grouping
[SPEAKER_04]: of fungus that exists in the natural
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it literally is a fungus that lives on
the roots of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has a really hard time producing its
own food, namely carbohydrates and sugars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually has partnered with plants,
and it did this as far back as we can tell
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plants, when they first came on land
from oceans, had very primitive root
[SPEAKER_04]: systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was this coming together of fungus
and ocean plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can think of it as like a holdfast for
a seaweed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mycorrhizal fungi allowed much more
surface area, so it's much finer than root
[SPEAKER_04]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it basically would cover the arid land
and absorb water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would break down minerals, all the
things we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it covered these root systems and
eventually formed with about 95% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: world's plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes the early nonvascular
plants from hornworts and liverworts and
[SPEAKER_04]: mosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the giant redwoods and conifers and
flowers and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So almost all of the world's plants form
with this soil fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a little bit different from
saprophytic fungi, which sort of exist
[SPEAKER_04]: independently and break things down in the
forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff relies on a host plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a very brief overview.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of those topics we could have spent
many minutes on, but that's just a very
[SPEAKER_04]: brief overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to highlight a couple other
things too for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you that are, I know this
is a cannabis podcast, but we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are growing other plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's many different types of
mycorrhizal fungi, which we can talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main ones being endomycorrhizal
fungus, ectomycorrhizal fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's another one called
aricoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, which I always associate with
azaleas and rhododendrons, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to realize that there are
different types of mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what those
types are and which plants they associate
[SPEAKER_01]: with, as well as the things like brassicas
that don't have that relationship?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you said, there's a couple of
broad groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the endomycorrhizae and the
ectomycorrhizae are probably the two
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have things like aricoid
mycorrhizae and even orchids have their
[SPEAKER_04]: own sort of partnering mycorrhizae,
interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the two main types that
commercially and practically we concern
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves with are these endo and ecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so endomycorrhizae is what we're all
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also called arbuscular mycorrhizae or
VAM, Vesticular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are two structures that it forms,
vesicles and arbuscules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that forms with roughly about 85% of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the type that forms with
cannabis, it forms with vegetables,
[SPEAKER_04]: it forms with fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really that's the main type that we
deal with in commercial uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other type is called ectomycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this forms mainly with your conifers,
your, you know, your oaks, other hardwoods
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that forms with roughly about,
you know, 10 to 12% of the world's plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more ubiquitous in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was on a conference call earlier this
morning, just kind of walking around the
[SPEAKER_04]: garden outside here and I literally found
a giant fruiting body of one of these
[SPEAKER_04]: ectomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably breathing in the spores
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those, yeah, so that forms another big
portion of the mycorrhizal fungi out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like you said, the Iroquois form
with, you know, kind of your acid soils,
[SPEAKER_04]: your acid loving plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, cranberries, huckleberries,
rhododendrons, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also have, which, so those,
they're not as stable and easy to produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also that's a much smaller grouping of
plants that they form with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as I know, those inoculums
aren't very available on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with orchid mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm sure orchid growers probably have
access to that or they culture their own,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But generally those two types really
aren't available on the market,
[SPEAKER_04]: either retail or commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, yeah, the plants that
don't form, which actually are,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a lot of the sort of plants
that thrive in disturbed soils,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're the pioneer plants,
as we call them in permaculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they come in and they don't need a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They can survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can break through concrete.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've seen like a dandelion,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are plants that have evolved and
just really never had a need for this
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal symbiosis, which is a really
interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there are a small grouping of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily for gardeners, a lot of them
are weeds that don't really need a
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, mycorrhizae actually helps
deter these a little bit in one's garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's kind of a broad overview
of all the different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we were growing something though,
like cauliflower or broccoli, which does
[SPEAKER_01]: not have a mycorrhizal relationship,
aren't there studies that show it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: will potentially be detrimental to the
plant if it does form that relationship?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be careful in how we're
applying it into which plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: To my knowledge, they don't form that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not really like a fungal forcing
onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant really chooses which mycorrhizae
to let in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, plants can actually turn off
and change the mycorrhizae that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: forming with throughout a season,
the same plant to get its needs met.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it needs more micronutrients,
there's species that are more adept in
[SPEAKER_04]: getting maybe zinc or something like that
out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plant will actually shift the
mycorrhizae that it's forming with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only thing that I can think of is
that in a heavily mycorrhizal dominated
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, if you have other plants growing
with mycorrhizal fungi, maybe it's out
[SPEAKER_04]: competing the brassicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've never heard of it being
detrimental to brassicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a new one to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd love to learn more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought I had read a study where it
showed that it is possible to form that
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship, but it's actually
detrimental to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a natural association.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago and I could be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't brushed up on it in quite a
while, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, look into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do find anything, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you did bring up though that I
wanted to go back to is you mentioned you
[SPEAKER_01]: saw a fruiting body or a mushroom of an
ectomycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I see with a lot
of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple things out there where
you see photos of roots and people are,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, let's use cannabis in this
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may see a bunch of mycelium and
say, oh, that's my mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll see mushrooms popping up in
their indoor cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say that that's because they
have a mycorrhizal relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I understand it, feel free to
correct me here, the endomycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus, you can't see without special
microscope tools to dye the roots to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're actually infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those particular gloma species
don't necessarily form fruiting bodies or
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they're seeing is probably some
saprophytic fungi that have found its way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's breaking down organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the most common one is the flower pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little yellow mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's it called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget the exact species, lucidium or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, it's just pot culture
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So growing plants and soil in pots is just
the ultimate environment for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it hitchhikes in on a lot of maybe it
was probably in the soil to begin with,
[SPEAKER_04]: or just finds its way in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes up, that's coming up in my
house plants right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we get guys that will send us pictures
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, that has nothing to do with the
endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're correct in that they don't form
fruiting bodies, which is why,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll get into this, there's so little
study.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the studies, it's like two
or three species at tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the estimated numbers at this point is
over 300.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all the ones we don't know
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've only studied a small portion of
them because they don't form fruiting
[SPEAKER_04]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially, yeah, they have to isolate
these spores.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to pull them out of soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can pull some of the mycelium,
which like you said, is smaller than is
[SPEAKER_04]: visible to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see ectomycorrhizae as it forms
these things called rhizomorphs,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like a lot of strains of mycelium
kind of coagulated together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually see that, which is
that famous picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever Googled mycorrhizae,
it's different species of pines,
[SPEAKER_04]: but on their root systems, it's this big
sort of hair net of mycelium radiating out
[SPEAKER_04]: in all directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see that because that's an
ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that these mushrooms are not connected
to the mycelium and growers, you won't
[SPEAKER_04]: really be able to see the mycelium with
the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you will probably see a strong,
healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some things that I can't talk
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't make any claims whatsoever about
our products because we're not registered
[SPEAKER_04]: as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you Google some of these species,
you will see that there are benefits from
[SPEAKER_04]: the fungus that when you pull a root
system out and it's white, there's not,
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be very careful on how I say
this, but there's not certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The color is the color that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: The roots are vibrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That indicates oftentimes that it has a
strong, a mycorrhizal relationship and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything's functioning as it should.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the micronutrients are making it up
and all of the different chemicals that
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant forms with that to protect
itself are all functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so you can't actually see the
mycelium if you were to pull out a root
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's safe to say that plants that
are healthier are less susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases and other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a plant that has a mycorrhizal
association may in theory be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier than a plant that doesn't
because most plants, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: 95% of them want to have this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you talk about some of the
benefits and how they may differ between
[SPEAKER_01]: endo and ecto mycorrhizal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with the ecto, you're on the
outside of the roots, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reaching out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endo is infecting into the root
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the differences in the benefits
of these two types of mycorrhizal fungus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so generally with both types,
you see increased surface area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, the first coming together
of these organisms was because plants'
[SPEAKER_04]: root systems weren't, the purpose wasn't
mineral and nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't to break down minerals and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't to absorb water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came from environments that those
things were in and sort of kind of an
[SPEAKER_04]: aqueous solution in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing you get is you get much more
surface area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mycelium essentially radiates out.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you have right around the root,
it's called the phosphorus depletion zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plants, when they're first given
nutrients, they'll eat up all the
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus and nutrients right around the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what these mycelium do is they sort
of poke out through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they radiate through that and they get
much more surface area able to take up
[SPEAKER_04]: those minerals and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also see they release exudates in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They release enzymes into the soil,
which make nutrients that get locked up,
[SPEAKER_04]: once again, bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they make that available.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're available to the plant,
the phosphorus and the nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's a couple other benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can actually fix nitrogen,
atmospheric nitrogen, just like the
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some bacteria out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even, in our blends, we have bacteria
that do this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the rhizome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rhizobium bacteria, like in a legume,
it's actually free-living bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the mycorrhizal fungi can fix
atmospheric nitrogen, which people don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know, not many people are aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one piece of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So stress on the plant, transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_04]: When a plant's transplanted, it's sending
out chemicals into the soil to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: germinate any mycorrhizal spores around
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When a seed germinates in nature,
it's immediately sending out these signals
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's grown and evolved,
you could say, to have this symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's used to having these ambient
spores around in its soil environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once this germinates, through all these
mechanisms that I've been talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: and ones that we haven't mentioned yet,
it allows the stress tolerance of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant to go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So too little water, too much water,
variances in pH, variances in temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant's actually gonna be able to
withstand that and actually thrive through
[SPEAKER_04]: that a lot better than if you didn't have
the mycorrhizal association.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really one of the benefits of
mycorrhizal fungi and actually one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons that we'll get into diversity
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that these inoculums do is
they allow you to bring your baseline up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your worst performing plant does a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now your best performing plant,
if everything lines up for that plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: your pH is right on, all your nutrients
are right on, everything's perfect and
[SPEAKER_04]: that plant does great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not gonna get a 10% increase in
yield no matter what anyone tells you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not everything's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really what these inoculums do and
what mycorrhizal specialty is,
[SPEAKER_04]: it brings that sort of, almost like the
law of minimums, where it brings your
[SPEAKER_04]: poorest performing plants up to a higher
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So overall, you're getting a more stable
yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting a more consistent yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually one of the reasons,
just briefly, why we included diversity in
[SPEAKER_04]: our blends is because specific mycorrhizal
species perform different functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I'll give you an example,
glomus clarum, one of the glomus species.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps with dealing with excess salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It improves mediation of heavy metals,
heavy metal toxicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glomus deserticola comes from arid
regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better at drought stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see, glomus mossae, it reduces
uptake of arsenic.
[SPEAKER_04]: One interesting example, but they all have
these different sort of specialties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when the plant encounters something
that it's detrimental to its growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: it literally will change directions and
start to utilize whatever species that can
[SPEAKER_04]: perform those functions that it needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in terms of your question about endo
versus ecto, to be honest, I need to
[SPEAKER_04]: research that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have never actually been asked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I'd be really curious to hear
the differences and the different benefits
[SPEAKER_04]: of the different sort of morphologies,
how they work in the root zone,
[SPEAKER_04]: how that translates into the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing you touched on is yeah,
ecto grow kind of between the root cells
[SPEAKER_04]: and endo grow into the root cell and they
form these little structures, which just
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of tell people, this is why it's
called arbuscular mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that they go into the root cell,
form these little structures that look
[SPEAKER_04]: like root systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually where the water and
their own nutrients are traded to the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant through a, there's a small little
membrane around the arbuscule and in
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange for that, it gets sugars and
carbohydrates that, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can't produce itself through that
structure inside the root cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think of it as endo in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, in terms of the difference
between the endo and the ecto in the
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits realm, I'd actually be curious
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the important thing for
people to keep in mind is that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you have the right species for
what you're planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not planting conifers,
do those ecto species have benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and I have talked previously to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been a big proponent of single
species inoculation because all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research that we see out there is
primarily with glomus intradices or
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizophagus intradices now as they're
calling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the glomus mossae or however you
pronounce it, I think that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher that discovered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the two most widely used and
most widely available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious what research you've
seen that would support using more diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: species of mycorrhizae in a mycorrhizal
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the big one is endo versus ecto,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, clearly if you're not growing ecto
plants, there's not a need for the ecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we have a number of products.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a single species endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a four species endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a diverse multiple species endo
and ecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we support all kind of directions that
the market is going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, clearly you don't need ecto if
you're not growing an ecto plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason that we've included it in some
of our blends over the years is it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said, it's ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally almost pennies per pound
for us to include it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in a gram of our popular
product, there's probably about maybe like
[SPEAKER_04]: 250 spores of endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow me now with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one gram of material.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got about two to 300 spores of the
endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a couple million spores of the
ecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're much smaller than the endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're super, super cheap to produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're literally coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We harvest those wilds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We harvest those fruiting bodies wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that did for us was allow our
blends to be used in a diverse array of
[SPEAKER_04]: environments, the specific ones where we
decided to include both.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it really easy for the end
consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was probably 10 years ago we
came out with those products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sort of as people, the market
developed and people were saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: we just want the endo and we just want
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want everything included.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started to broaden our product
offering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we have products that are just
endo and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like I said, we have the just
endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's absolutely no detrimental
effect to having the ecto in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like you said, if you're not
forming with the conifer, it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of my favorite products that
we still do is the great white in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria and endo mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you weren't even considering the
ecto for the value, the value that you
[SPEAKER_04]: get, the concentration of endo and the
bacteria in there is really unrivaled in
[SPEAKER_04]: the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd really have to buy two separate
products at almost double the price to get
[SPEAKER_04]: those concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not growing a conifer,
there's no need for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they still prove to be super
effective products if they do have the
[SPEAKER_04]: blend in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we support one species,
four species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the great white has eight species of
endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, specifically talking about
endodiversity, what our researchers are
[SPEAKER_04]: showing and what the research is kind of
beginning to reveal, because in the past,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically this stuff is very little
studied.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, we have the Glomis
irregularis, Glomis inneradise.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Glomis macei, Glomis aggregatum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a few species that have been
studied.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, they've only been studied for
a very limited kind of set of parameters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not testing for it's tough to test
for all the conditions that are out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the reasons people might be using
these inoculums in the actual field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sort of the thinking, this has been
passed on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the researcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been passed on from sort of our
research department and our scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're continuing actually to isolate
different species and begin to test those
[SPEAKER_04]: for their viability in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was passed on to me is that
having diversity, first of all,
[SPEAKER_04]: my ethos is diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So permaculture and ecology sort of
dictate that as a principle, diversity is
[SPEAKER_04]: more resilient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how that works out into the mycorrhizal
sphere is just like I said, all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal species have different
specialty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Glomis inneradise is known as a broad
former.
[SPEAKER_04]: It forms early and it's great at uptaking
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not the only sort of problem
that growers are facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all sorts of conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have pH problems, you have temperature
problems, you have disease problems,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have sort of micronutrient
deficiencies, you have nutrient sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: lockout, you have all of these things that
the plant needs to, well, either the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: figures out a way to overcome these
problems or it shows up as a reduction in
[SPEAKER_04]: yield or some sort of revolve scene
deficiencies in our leaves and those sorts
[SPEAKER_04]: of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of talks about further the
plant's natural defenses because they
[SPEAKER_04]: actually rely on the ability to get
micronutrients and to get these,
[SPEAKER_04]: just water and all of these other things
to actually form these compounds and form
[SPEAKER_04]: these different chemicals and exudates and
things like that, which can actually keep
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant growing to maximizing its
genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the mycorrhizal fungi,
like I said, what we've seen is the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: is actually able to cut off flow of
nutrients to specific species and
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the season, switch that over to
other species that are actually taking
[SPEAKER_04]: care of and have the ability to solve the
problem that the plant is facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can happen throughout the course
of the season or that can just happen
[SPEAKER_04]: straight out of the gate, especially with
this kind of moving more into broad acre
[SPEAKER_04]: applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different conditions and
environments that growers are facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So different pHs, different soil makeups,
different soil chemistries, different
[SPEAKER_04]: climates, all those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One mycorrhizal species is somewhat
limited in its ability to overcome those
[SPEAKER_04]: various problems that the plant is facing,
whereas the diversity of species does have
[SPEAKER_04]: the tool belt or the tool chest,
if you will, to solve those problems and
[SPEAKER_04]: create those compounds and be able to
adapt to the situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really, like I said,
we offer single species, but we promote a
[SPEAKER_04]: diverse species within those groupings,
endo versus ecto.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how we've built our
inoculums.
[SPEAKER_04]: But any inoculation is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using single species,
multiple species, your plant's really
[SPEAKER_04]: going to see a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that a plant can switch
its mycorrhizal association or infection
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a cannabis cycle, for example,
where you have a plant that may only have
[SPEAKER_01]: 55, 60 days of flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that the plant could start
off with, say, a relationship with Glomus
[SPEAKER_01]: interatices or rhizophagus interatices,
and then switch halfway through to
[SPEAKER_01]: something else, say, if conditions change,
like to the Glomus deserticola,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can it have multiple infections within
the same plant of different species at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time on, say, different root hairs or
root tips?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the information that I've been
passed on, is that both of those scenarios
[SPEAKER_04]: can happen with mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, to my knowledge, that is possible
with both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, all of this stuff needs
to be studied further.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially as cannabis is,
we can actually study it now with labs and
[SPEAKER_04]: universities.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just the mycorrhizal discipline in
general has a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, inoculum, single-species
inoculum is fantastic for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a principle, I think diversity is a
good way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a lot to learn in terms of how
that functions in a root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of challenges around
organic and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about this, I think,
last podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know definitely off air,
I was talking with a friend about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: how a lot of the research being done,
it's very hard to do it with organics
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much we don't know about
the microbial interactions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere that it's very hard to isolate
and make any definitive claims or evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: of claims moving forward based on what
we're seeing, because there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's relationships between different
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's relationships between the plant
and the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to isolate down to
the effect of one particular variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kind of brought me to another
question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the challenges as a consumer is
there's so many different mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: products on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we evaluate them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked just now, you explained your
opinion on diversity versus
[SPEAKER_01]: single-species, which made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we evaluate these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a few different things I
want to look at here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already talked about endo versus
ecto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're applying it to fruit trees,
if we're applying it to our garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to make sure we have endo
mycorrhizal fungus in our mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ecto is probably, it's not going
to hurt anything, but it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're looking for for that
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure we're comparing
endo species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need to look at, do we have a
single species versus a diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: species?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the concentrations,
which, and this is something we should
[SPEAKER_01]: probably go over too, talking about how
labeling works with propagules versus
[SPEAKER_01]: spores and what's most viable for
consumers when they're applying these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you see guys and they'll look at a
label and they say, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this has 2 million propagules per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you break it out, it's actually
maybe 250 propagules per gram of the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual species that could potentially
infect or, you know, benefit the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you just kind of maybe go over some
of those things in a little more detail
[SPEAKER_01]: and explain your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how I think of it is, this isn't going
to sound funny, but we're exiting the age
[SPEAKER_04]: of the wild west microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is, you know,
we've had companies and products just
[SPEAKER_04]: claiming the most outrageous stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't name names, but those products are
somewhat gone from the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the super outrageous ones are
gone, but the reputation of the company,
[SPEAKER_04]: the age of the company is a big deal
because this stuff is microscopic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're essentially buying a car that's,
you know, under a blanket or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to look at the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to inspect the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to see the integrity of
the engine or the wheels or anything like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this stuff is microscopic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the company's reputation in
the industry makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing, so, you know,
when you go and take a look at these
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculants, yeah, the first thing you want
to do is flip it over and start with what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we'll get into that,
whether or not that's reliable in a
[SPEAKER_04]: minute, but start with what they're
claiming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking at, you know,
apples for apples, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're looking for endo, look at the
diversity, and then look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: propagules.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll either say propagules or grams or
propagules or spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a good indicator of how many,
I guess, units of material are in that
[SPEAKER_04]: that will actually germinate and create
this mycorrhizal network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what propagules and spores is,
is that the spores are the, it's like the
[SPEAKER_04]: seed of the apple, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can grow this fungus with a spore
because it has the genetic material,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the term propagule, as we were talking
about earlier, it would be easier with
[SPEAKER_04]: fruiting bodies and mushrooms who produce
much more even spore material.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually spores, but with the
endome mycorrhizae because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think of that, how that functions in an
ecosystem, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have plants that die that their root
system is where these spores were formed
[SPEAKER_04]: and where these spores are going to pass
on that genetic material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So oftentimes the spores don't have the
advantage of, you know, hanging from a cap
[SPEAKER_04]: as a gill wood and a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be blown around by the wind,
or it could be knocked by an animal,
[SPEAKER_04]: or oftentimes squirrels are really
important, especially for truffles with
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: of these organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have these, these mechanical
means of moving these spores around the
[SPEAKER_04]: forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So oftentimes the spores end up in the
roots themselves and the plants just die
[SPEAKER_04]: and that slowly decomposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that root is actually still viable
because it's either filled with spores or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just a fragment that will actually
germinate into when the next plant root
[SPEAKER_04]: finds its way down there, sends out those
chemical messengers we were talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, then that can germinate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're talking about production of
endome mycorrhizae, you're going to end up
[SPEAKER_04]: with both root fragments and spores and
they're both viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a process that you can just kind
of extrapolate to spores, but it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people claim, oh, we've got this
and that, you know, billion spores per
[SPEAKER_04]: gram, it's not accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to have any price that's
somewhat competitive in the marketplace at
[SPEAKER_04]: this point, they probably don't understand
their product because they should.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so usually it's going to say
propagules.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a more accurate description of the
material that's on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, like I said, you want to look at
the concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, two to 300 propagules per
gram is very, very high.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, that's a real concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, around 100 is a good,
is not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what our lawn and garden
mixes are just because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the average person buying a rose or a
tomato plant is not going to go for the
[SPEAKER_04]: higher prices.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because when you add those
concentrations, the price goes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we could sell you a four
ounces of material for $7,000 or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, because you can get these
things really concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so, you know, what you're looking for
is a good two to 300 propagules per gram
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our liquid, however, with milliliters,
it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different volume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're close to, I think, like 60 to 80
propagules per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how that works out is like,
you know, it's the same rate or the same
[SPEAKER_04]: cost per plant to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the numbers are different,
the way that the volume works out,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you were going to treat a
four-inch plant, it would cost the same
[SPEAKER_04]: with our liquid as it would with the Great
White or, you know, our powdered products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can go with the straight
mycorrhizal inoculum.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have products like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our products, like I said,
we pride ourselves on diversity,
[SPEAKER_04]: also carry specific bacteria that have
been well-documented and documented and
[SPEAKER_04]: studied to provide things for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, nitrogen fixation or
phosphorus, solubilization, enzyme
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all these things that work hand-in-hand
with the mycorrhizal fungi and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: other soil organisms for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these secondary metabolites,
as they're called from the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: are super functional and helpful for
plants and mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the inoculums have beneficial soil
bacteria in there, we found that the
[SPEAKER_04]: synergistic effect of mycorrhizal fungi
combined with these bacterial concentrates
[SPEAKER_04]: shows better yield or better results
versus just using one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially as a consumer, what you
want to look at is the concentrations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will most likely be expressed in
propygols per gram, of the particular
[SPEAKER_01]: species which we're looking for,
or type of mycorrhizal, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: endo, and then beyond that, diversity,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, one of the things that
you touched on there that I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: examine a little closer is that there's no
one really doing research or testing of
[SPEAKER_01]: people's claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I understand it, I know with soil,
when I registered my product, I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a guaranteed analysis claim if it's
going to be registered as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever that claim is,
I have to show a lab test supporting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then at that point, the state would be
randomly testing the product, maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling it off the shelf to see if it
actually met those standards down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of in the actual bags themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume it's the same on the microbial
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had one test, for example,
that said you had a thousand propygols per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram, you could put that on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in theory, until the state or
whoever registered body tested it,
[SPEAKER_01]: no one would ever know what was actually
in that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I saying this correctly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's been some tests done by the
Oregon Department of Agriculture that have
[SPEAKER_01]: shown mycorrhizal levels and other
microbial levels from 2016 as being very
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the claims that were on the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that at all or is that
too tricky of a subject?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're actually really happy that
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I said, that gives companies
like us who have been honest and actually
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in what we claim a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Oregon is beginning to test
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we actually, my family's company
sort of helped them develop some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tests for the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mycorrhizal fungi are much different
than bacteria and they were sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: treating them like bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, the testing is beginning to
happen and that's kind of why I said we're
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of the age of the wild wild
west because there were some products out
[SPEAKER_04]: there that just made outrageous claims.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this testing is going to consolidate
and kind of weed out some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: companies and products who aren't being
truthful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, people can put whatever
they want on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're responsible for a guaranteed
analysis in terms of NPK and derived from
[SPEAKER_04]: statements, but with the microbials,
it's kind of been this gray area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oregon's kind of leading the pack,
but a lot of other states will probably
[SPEAKER_04]: adopt some of the testing methodologies
and the regulatory piece of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually, it's a good thing for
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we do, this is kind of how it
works on the microbe side is, so we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: actually, we'll formulate things to
concentrations that we think are adequate
[SPEAKER_04]: for the type of grower that we're making
the product for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll actually get it tested by
an independent lab and they will verify
[SPEAKER_04]: what we've been doing and aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll reduce it by about 20 to
25% when we claim it on the back of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bag to give a window so that when they do,
because the regulators will go through and
[SPEAKER_04]: as you know, just pull product off the
shelf at any licensed retailer and test
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we actually allow, we claim less
than we know is in the bag for the odd
[SPEAKER_04]: batch that doesn't have, didn't get mixed
perfectly or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually claim a lot less than
what's in there that we aim for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fertilizer is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: People do the same thing with fertilizer,
but yeah, that's kind of the state of the
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really good thing for consumers
because these microbials, like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: are invisible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people could claim anything and it
would never be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing for people to do is to
take a look at a label, try and understand
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the best of their ability,
do their own research and then really just
[SPEAKER_01]: see, look at plant response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think use Great White, use some of
these other brands and see what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: results you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's ultimately what we're looking
for anyway, I think is plant response.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's- Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be in touch with your garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really why we've been
successful as a company because people do
[SPEAKER_04]: these side by sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you how many times I go to a
new nursery or we hand out a sample at a
[SPEAKER_04]: trade show and we'll get pictures back
like, wow, look at the difference in the
[SPEAKER_04]: root system because this is an ancient
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants depend on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like going through and bleaching the
inside of a human being.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only lasts about a week or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost how we've been treating
plants is we just destroy the biosphere
[SPEAKER_04]: and expect these plants to perform at a
high level.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we end up, okay, well,
now we need like 90% extra fertilizers
[SPEAKER_04]: because most of it's getting locked up and
the plant roots can't release the exudates
[SPEAKER_04]: to get it unlocked, or we hit them with
fungicides or pesticides because now their
[SPEAKER_04]: immune systems are compromised.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_04]: These microbes work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microisofungi works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a relationship that's, like I said,
as old as land plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, use the stuff and see it for
yourself until you actually try something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try something and see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all hearsay anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't take what I'm saying is the
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to talk about some of the other
bacteria and other ingredients in great
[SPEAKER_01]: white, but before we do, can we talk a
little bit about best practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is best practice around
application of these microbial products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one thing I want to touch on,
because we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling now that I'm thinking of it,
is I see, you'll get a soil bag or a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of fertilizer and they'll say,
with mycorrhizae on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go and look on the back and
it's like 0.008 propagules per gram or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, like just a really,
really small number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I typically tell people that that's
probably not enough for them to get
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're better off applying it directly to
the roots of their plant rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it homogenously throughout the
soil or trying to get it with fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I understand it, because it is a
sporopropagule, it also doesn't move
[SPEAKER_01]: through the soil very effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a physical mechanism of watering
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to apply it directly to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you give what your pointers would
be for people who want to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal product with their plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, direct contact is essential.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant root releases a chemical,
I'm forgetting the name, that triggers the
[SPEAKER_04]: spore to send out a hyphal tip,
which then plugs into the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that physical contact is crucial.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have microbes that are dispersed
a foot away, three feet away from the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, if you're doing a short season
annual crop, most likely it's not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: germinate until late in the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by that time, it really is not
benefiting the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to think of all those spores as
investments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You spent money to get those into your
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best way to use them is to get it
right on the plant root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have powders that you can sprinkle
right on the roots themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also dissolve those powders in
water and water it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send it through your fertigation
system, put it in your reservoir,
[SPEAKER_04]: have it drip down in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any way for it to actually make contact
with the root system is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have granular products that were
designed not to be dissolved in water,
[SPEAKER_04]: just to be sprinkled into the hole at
transplant time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really the most cost-effective
way to inoculate your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to talk about bagged soils and
fertilizers, yeah, I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that people are paying attention to
and soil companies, fertilizer companies
[SPEAKER_04]: are beginning to honor the soil microbes
and include them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with soil is that like you
said, the concentrations are really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really low.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to see a good plant response,
for example, our bare minimum for a
[SPEAKER_04]: four-inch plant is about 10 spores,
if you're talking about endomycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 spores per plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So oftentimes with these bagged soils,
you'd have to use a whole lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: or there's just not enough material in
there to actually make a real difference
[SPEAKER_04]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides that, these bags are often stored
in direct sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this bag sits in the sun for a day,
most likely everything in there is dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: If something does happen to get in there
that you don't want, so once again,
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even talked about this,
but the concept of having a sterile soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem with that is that that is a
ripe environment for an explosion of some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of disease or something that you
don't want in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't, one of the real ways that
these inoculums work is that they create
[SPEAKER_04]: this balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: They create sort of this net that when
something unwanted comes in to the system,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's immediately out-competed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge one with mycorrhizal fungi
is that there's not a lot of ambient
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients or spaces for disease to exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a big one with the soils is that
they often get sterilized in the sun,
[SPEAKER_04]: besides having low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the fertilizer, it's generally
the same thing, really, really low
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive for them to really hit
it with a lot of the sort of microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we recommend is buying straight
fertilizer, buying your straight soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then adding the biology when it makes
it to your grow, your site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another reason is that we as a company
pay a lot of attention to and spend a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of time and effort in maintaining an
environment and shipping our products and
[SPEAKER_04]: educating the stores and the retailers on
how to store these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's printed right on our bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bags are all designed as well as the
jars for sort of maximum stability of
[SPEAKER_04]: these organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So also in the, like, you know,
the supply chain, the delivery,
[SPEAKER_04]: these organisms are taken care of so that
once they make it to you, they're in a
[SPEAKER_04]: prime condition to come out of dormancy
and colonize your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, those are those are key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a fast crop like cannabis,
for example, that may, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 90 days, for example, or even less
in a lot of cases, we want we want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycorrhizal infection to occur as
quickly as possible, which means directly
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the seeds or rooted clones when we
transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is it to re inoculate when
we transplant at least later stages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've always been a big proponent
of doing a really heavy inoculation right
[SPEAKER_01]: at right at the time of planting,
say, your rooted clone or your seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: and then not reapplying when I transplant
at later stages just because it gets so
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive relative to potential benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen have you seen benefit with
later applications of mycorrhizal fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: yet at other stages of transplant?
[SPEAKER_04]: With a pure mycorrhizal inoculum,
I would say that what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one more application.
[SPEAKER_04]: With our products, they also contain huge
diversity and really high concentrations
[SPEAKER_04]: of the beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not talking about our products,
but talking about BT, bacillus
[SPEAKER_04]: thuringiensis, which our products happen
to contain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's a bio pesticide in the
organic world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost so I think of these
inoculums that contain the bacteria as
[SPEAKER_04]: well as the mycorrhizal fungi is basically
instant compost teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm always revolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll just use our straight
powders in water or sometimes I'll brew
[SPEAKER_04]: compost tea with worm castings or compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm constantly adding teas and
biology to my soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of a straight mycorrhizal
inoculum, I think that one heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculation will give you a really good
colonization of your root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing it more, you know, it depends on the
specific growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, people will have to try it
for themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a general rule, with a straight
mycorrhizal inoculum, I don't think you're
[SPEAKER_04]: really going to see a huge return on
investment for a second and a third
[SPEAKER_04]: application.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, our products are a little
more complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have seen people using it every
feeding, every watering, as a
[SPEAKER_04]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, whether that's broad acre or
you're growing in a very, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled environment and growing indoor,
you know, every condition is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll kind of have to assess it for
yourself and see if that prevention is
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary and worth it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, if you're getting along just
fine, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's essentially like taking a
probiotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so people take those ongoing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the mycorrhizae, really what
you're looking for is just to get around,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 75 to 85 percent colonization of
the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it depends on the success of the first
inoculation, which, you know, is different
[SPEAKER_04]: every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're doing it, like you said,
a really heavy inoculation right on the
[SPEAKER_04]: roots, you're probably getting a really
heavy colonization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how long does that time to infection
occur or colonization, as you're calling
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is it takes at least 10
to 14 days under good conditions or even
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate or what are you finding
for infection rates?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see the bacteria in our products go to
work a little quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the great white has glycine,
which is a simple sugar B1 vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see people like, oh, my gosh,
my roots are going nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're super white, you know,
or it helps remediate something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: gone awry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, that's the bacteria and like
the trichoderma, which I think we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: probably talk about next.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are heavy enzyme producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're breaking down organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you've got dead roots on there
that are turning brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got sloughed off roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got excess, you know, organic
matter in the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those bacteria are just really,
really heavy, like I said, enzyme
[SPEAKER_04]: producers, micronutrient solubilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really going to work and just
cleaning up that whole root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So generally, mycorrhizal colonization
takes just under two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bacteria sort of peak and then the
root system returns to a kind of a steady
[SPEAKER_04]: state based on the exudates and the sugars
released by the root system itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacteria peak and then mycorrhizal
colonization takes about 10 to 14 days,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I do want to talk about the bacteria,
but I had a couple more questions before
[SPEAKER_01]: we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, one of the questions is the
persistence of these mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: propagules or spores in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, if someone was running
a living soil indoors or even let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: soil in their greenhouse or outdoors,
they, you know, they pull the plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: even just cut the plant at the stock and
let those roots break down right there in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the persistence of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycorrhizal, those mycorrhizal spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we need to re inoculate every cycle
in, say, a living soil bed or in soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're reusing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, what I generally tell people
is that I haven't seen a ton of studies on
[SPEAKER_04]: carryover of roots and to, you know,
season after season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I guess it's fair to assume if
it's the same species, you will have some
[SPEAKER_04]: carryover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like a lot of these spores or a lot of
these endo mycorrhizal root systems don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some of them take, it depends on
the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it depends on the growing
condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of them can take three years to
produce spores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them can take, you know,
six months, seven months, like one growing
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not an expert in that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's plausible that the roots of,
you know, will stay alive long enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: or the mycelium will stay alive long
enough to colonize the next crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think there's a whole lot of
research done on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't really be confident or
comfortable making a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with the cost of inoculation and
the business that we're in, it's a no
[SPEAKER_04]: brainer for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like if you're going to buy
some fish and some kelp and rock dust,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I advocate you do, you know,
why not buy $20 of material to treat your
[SPEAKER_04]: whole crop with mycorrhizal fungi?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't have to use this stuff
like a, you know, like a flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like a pizza dough or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to throw a ton of this
stuff at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually, you know, dilute it and
use it at the recommended rates as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: which will make it go a lot further.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually recommend that over using a
ton and then hoping it carries over from
[SPEAKER_04]: season to season because of the benefits
of using it on a new seedling for stress
[SPEAKER_04]: and transplant and all the things that
we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, in terms of carryover,
I'd like to see some studies, but I
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't seen any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I'm wondering is if that,
if, for example, we had, let's just take a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by eight raised bed, just to simplify
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a plant, a cannabis plant
growing in there and that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: we go to harvest that plant and let's say
we take out the roots, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the main roots, but don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be root, there's going
to be a bunch of root hairs and leftover
[SPEAKER_01]: root material in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to plant, say a cover crop or
our next cycle of cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: would the mycorrhizal fungus that had
infected the crop before potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: infect the new crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's definitely potentially,
but you know, it all depends on what
[SPEAKER_04]: species colonize the cannabis and what
species of cover crop you're planting and
[SPEAKER_04]: whether or not the two are compatible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the length of time between
the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if it's a day or two,
yeah, it's definitely reasonable and
[SPEAKER_04]: plausible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious if you knew the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I love, I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from the world of permaculture and
sustainability and environmental science.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm all about the least amount of
inputs and, you know, extraction and all
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, phosphorus mining and fish
emulsion that we have to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, drive a thousand miles and put
on our land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm all about growing bioaccumulators
and extracting what we can from the land
[SPEAKER_04]: in a sustainable way and reusing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, let's do those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had mentioned in our email,
you have something about explaining
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques for extending effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that a little bit or what
you meant by that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so like I was talking about with the
bacteria, they kind of peak and then
[SPEAKER_04]: plummet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And same thing with the mycorrhizal fungi
is they, the reason that we include sugars
[SPEAKER_04]: in our blends is that those are the
preferred, that's the food source of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria in the fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That fuels the whole soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've come out with is this
product called MycoChum, which has fish
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrolysate, which as opposed to emulsion,
you had the gentleman from Dram on and I
[SPEAKER_04]: just loved his explanation of how that
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But essentially the hydrolysate is much
better for bacteria and fungi because it
[SPEAKER_04]: contains all of the proteins and fatty
acids and a much more diverse palette of
[SPEAKER_04]: foods for these soil organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well, we have kelp, which has a huge
array of micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have molasses, once again, high in
carbohydrates and micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then your humic acids, which have your
humic substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's feeding the microbes is one thing
that I think is really a beneficial thing
[SPEAKER_04]: to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's adding your compost teas regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's topping off your compost teas after
you're done brewing them with a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of kind of those things that I just talked
about to extend their life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've over the years, the things that
we cultured and grow these mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi with, and we've run the gamut of
foods to feed these things and to see
[SPEAKER_04]: their responses.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what this MycoChum product is.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all of the foods that the soil
food web thrives on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, what I meant by that was just
feeding these organisms, encouraging these
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms, and it's all the same things
that, well, generally that plants like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have good aeration, you have a
stable pH, you have good water content,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not overwatering, you're not
underwatering, and you're providing a food
[SPEAKER_04]: for these organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like biochar that provides a
habitat, if you will, for these organisms
[SPEAKER_04]: is super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really culturing and nurturing these
soil organisms is what I was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a healthy population of
bacteria that doesn't plummet and then
[SPEAKER_04]: rely solely on the plant exudates,
is you can kind of keep it running at a
[SPEAKER_04]: peak of solubilizing any nutrients in the
soil, making available to the plant so
[SPEAKER_04]: there's like excess of these enzymes and
micronutrients available to the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of sort of letting them die back
and then there's a bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just the same logic as,
like I said, the adding compost heaths to
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil is you're just kind of maxing
out that soil biology so that when the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant needs it, the soil food web
delivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a copy, I mean, I got a sample of
the mycochum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep wanting to call it chum food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mycochum, so the mycochum does not
have mycorrhizal fungus in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but rather it's this combination of fish,
kelp, humic, at a very good price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next round of microscope testing,
it's at the top of my list of things to
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment with to see how it works with
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what its effect is on soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and I have an order coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any listeners that want to try
it out, they can reach out to me via
[SPEAKER_01]: email, but it's not available on our
website yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can definitely help get some into
your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm sending some to my buddy Nelson
down in California to do some experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm excited to hear what's going
on with that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's go ahead and jump in and talk
about the bacteria now and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: other microbes in your soil, because you
and I talked off air about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some questions that you addressed
when we had earlier discussions,
[SPEAKER_01]: because one of the things that I've seen
is there's a lot of mixed opinions around
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma and mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at some of the research,
and there's a variety of research out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was a study at the University
of Florida showing that trichoderma
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibited mycorrhizal infection in plants,
along with high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's fairly well established because
one of the main benefits of mycorrhizae is
[SPEAKER_01]: that phosphorus relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the plant's already getting plenty
of phosphorus, it thinks, oh, I don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: this mycorrhizal relationship,
even though the mycorrhizae has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other benefits that you already mentioned
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to avoid high P early on before
the plant has time to get that infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with trichoderma, there's a lot of
different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: of trichodermis, which is, I think,
important to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in addition to that, it's been
shown to inhibit spore germination and
[SPEAKER_01]: colonization of mycorrhizal fungi,
particularly the endospecies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that it definitely has been
documented that trichoderma can consume
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizal spores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it can also sort of inhibit the
mycelium growth to a degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot more testing that
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also other studies that show
there's absolutely no effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a study out of Spain that I can't
see the university, but I'm actually
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they used trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somewhere in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Glamis Masse, Glamis deserticola.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they showed, I can't find the
trichoderma species, but they showed zero
[SPEAKER_04]: effect on colonization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this study was done in 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think there's more research
yet to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've seen in the studies that we
did and in the research that we
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulated before we made the products is
that there's actually a symbiotic,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a beneficial effect to using both
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's certain benefits that the
trichoderma provide, and then there's
[SPEAKER_04]: certain benefits that the mycorrhizal
fungi provide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think when they're used in
combination, you actually get a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's a black and white
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, like you said, there's so many
different soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half of our products don't have
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, we have a gamut of
products, if you're interested in having
[SPEAKER_04]: one with or without.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like our famous, one of our products,
the Orca, the liquid version of Great
[SPEAKER_04]: White, doesn't have trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have products without it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that being said, Great White is still
my favorite product, which has the
[SPEAKER_04]: trichoderma in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the benefits of the
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of them is just really,
really high enzyme release.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one's breaking down organic matter
at a really fast rate compared to other
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, like I said, there's benefits
that I can't make any claims about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you Google trichoderma,
there's some biopesticide research about
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some people stagger their inoculations,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll inoculate with the mycorrhizae,
and then they'll inoculate with
[SPEAKER_04]: trichoderma a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things that I like to point
out is that lab conditions are so
[SPEAKER_04]: drastically different from field
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of these studies documented,
oh, hey, this is possible, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the trichoderma can become antagonistic
towards the mycorrhizal fungi in a petri
[SPEAKER_04]: dish, not necessarily in a growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing about trichoderma is it's
absolutely everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ever try and culture like
mushrooms indoors, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: oysters or shiitakes or anything like
that, one of the main things that infects
[SPEAKER_04]: your medium is actually trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're breathing it in right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely everywhere, and it's
ubiquitous in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question is, how do these things
interact in a soil environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as we can tell, there's a big
benefit to actually having it in your
[SPEAKER_04]: medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether or not you stagger the
inoculations, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been doing this for 15 years
with the Great White, and that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: product that has it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And growers just have tremendous results.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've seen a benefit in using both
in combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if there is a situation where it's
becoming antagonistic to the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like people are sometimes splitting
hairs over this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, using a product like Great White
with trichoderma outperforms
[SPEAKER_04]: non-inoculation every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even when compared with, for example,
a single species mycorrhizal versus a
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple species mycorrhizae with multiple
species bacteria and trichoderma,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just performs fairly well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's a lot more research yet
to be done, and I don't think it's black
[SPEAKER_04]: and white.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Elaine Ingham is a really amazing
researcher, and a lot of her actual field
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge of how this stuff performs in
actual soil conditions is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from the testing that we've done and
the feedback that we've gotten from our
[SPEAKER_04]: friends and growers is that it works
really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think the jury's in on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, I have access to all of
the products here at the company,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I consistently... Great White for me
is the pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up a few different points I
want to touch on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty well established that
trichoderma attacks mycorrhizae and plate
[SPEAKER_01]: assays, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soils, like I've seen some studies
that show it does cause damage to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal infection rates, but there's
also other ones that show that maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: spatial distribution in soils allow both
to function normally or to have
[SPEAKER_01]: synergistic positive interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you really need to experiment
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately, you might be right
that, yes, if it is the trichoderma that
[SPEAKER_01]: is providing the benefit, like that's
something that Tim Wilson, the
[SPEAKER_01]: micro-organic has speculated for years,
at the end of the day, does it really
[SPEAKER_01]: matter if you're getting a plant growth
response or plant health response that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, does it matter if it was the
trichoderma or the mycorrhizal infection
[SPEAKER_01]: that's providing these benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've always wondered about,
though, is really... So like you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, trichoderma is ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aggressive microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're putting in, say, 187,000 CFUs
per gram, how does endomycorrhizae at a
[SPEAKER_01]: mere 200 spores per gram or propygill's
per gram really compete in that space?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one question I've always had about
the difference in concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know trichoderma is a lot more
affordable to add into these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: but why the discrepancy in the rates,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so one thing is that the great white
in testing has shown great mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_04]: colonization of the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an effective product, and the
mycorrhizae is still infecting the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: at a successful rate in terms of,
yeah, the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to ask the researchers on that or
our tech guys, because I don't know the
[SPEAKER_04]: answer of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said, that research of the
spatial distribution is important to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: each to sort of function and not
cannibalize the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's a good question about the
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like I said, at this point,
the product is successful and works and
[SPEAKER_04]: has a high colonization rate, but I don't
know how that actually plays out with the
[SPEAKER_04]: ratio there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one I'll have to...
[SPEAKER_04]: Do more research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and to touch on some of these other
bacteria that you have in the product that
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognize, like Bacillus subtilis,
that's in Serenade and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, particular species of Bacillus
subtilis, but that's another one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been shown to have a lot of different
plant benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bacillus thuringiensis, I can never
pronounce it, the BT, the Israelis
[SPEAKER_01]: species, is the one that's super useful
when trying to control fungus gnats and
[SPEAKER_01]: other issues like that, or caterpillars,
it's something you'd spray on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed you have Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, which is brewer's yeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are taking barley seeds and
grinding those up as something also from
[SPEAKER_01]: the brewing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've read some really wonderful books
on that particular fungus, but do you
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to know much more about what
benefits that has in the soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that species specifically, I am not...
Well, I'm not a bacteria expert,
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that to get go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have actually a ton of
research on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[SPEAKER_04]: besides the beer that I brew.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably actually are more of an
expert on that than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, but bacteria in general,
you kind of already cover it, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: them do a lot of the same things,
just kind of from a different species,
[SPEAKER_04]: different angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in general, you're getting nitrogen
fixation, phosphorus solubilization,
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrient solubilization, and enzyme
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also to create organic glues,
like high carbon glues that help with soil
[SPEAKER_04]: structure over the long term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, those are the big benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really works in synthesis or in
combination with the mycorrhizal fungi and
[SPEAKER_04]: help with their needs and their sort of
ability to extract these micronutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we include them, we're more
specialized, we cut our teeth and we
[SPEAKER_04]: started in the mycorrhizal space and
slowly included bacteria in our products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, I'm not an expert on the
bacteria, but those are just sort of an
[SPEAKER_04]: overview of what they do and what they add
to our micro products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I know there's a lot we don't know
as a...
[SPEAKER_01]: As a species about all of these things,
like humans are still learning so much
[SPEAKER_01]: about all of these different microbes and
how they interact and discovering new
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't expect you to have all the
answers by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are seeing with all this research
that diversity really is one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important things when it comes to soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see why you would wanna be
applying a diversity of microbes when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're...
[SPEAKER_00]: Inoculating your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one thing that blows my mind is like
the microscope has only been around for
[SPEAKER_04]: like 100 years and popular use for less
than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this whole world of microbes is just
coming into focus for us as a species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's hundreds of thousands of
species out there that aren't tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your average compost bin is like,
talk about diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just the species that we've
isolated and actually ran through the
[SPEAKER_04]: gamut of expensive testing to see their
benefits on agriculture and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much diversity out there that
we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in general, like you said,
it's about diversity and it's about sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of doing those things like composting and
compost teas and all those practices that
[SPEAKER_04]: in my mind, they mimic natural systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: The forest is one of the most productive
ecosystems on the planet and it's all
[SPEAKER_04]: passive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything leads into something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's wasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of what we're doing in my mind,
we're learning more about how these
[SPEAKER_04]: systems function.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of what I do and what we do as a
company is really just trying to mimic the
[SPEAKER_04]: best of these natural systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there's a lot left to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the idea of trying to just
balance or recreate these ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, like you said, that we know are
highly functional and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else that I'm out of
questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else you wanted to
touch on, though, before we go?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that that pretty much covers
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, I really appreciate your time
today.
