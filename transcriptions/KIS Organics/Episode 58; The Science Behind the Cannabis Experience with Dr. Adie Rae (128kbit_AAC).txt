[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ray is an NIH-funded neuroscientist
who has been studying cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids, and their interaction for her
entire career.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a strong publication record in
chronic pain, addiction, and harm
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ray is currently an assistant
scientist at Legacy Research Institute in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, Oregon and holds a joint faculty
appointment at Washington State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her multifaceted work ranges from synaptic
physiology to clinical pain management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ray's long-term academic research goal
is to define the harm reduction potential
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis in the opioid overdose
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a co-founder of Smart Cannabis,
A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: leverages her knowledge of pharmacology to
enhance consumer well-being and support
[SPEAKER_00]: craft cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart Cannabis is a Portland-based
consulting and research firm that
[SPEAKER_00]: empirically identifies the world's most
enjoyable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me,
Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had such a great time meeting
Steph finally in person down at Photo X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said you'd be the best one to talk
to on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a brief background on your
research and how you got to the place that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are today?
[SPEAKER_02]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've been studying cannabis
and cannabinoids my entire adult life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote my first grant to study
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the laboratory in 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hypothesis in my academic work is
that we can use cannabis and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: to reduce our reliance upon prescription
opioid drugs for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've studied this problem from a number
of different angles, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way zoomed way in down to how the
neurons in the brain function in the
[SPEAKER_02]: presence of these drugs all the way out
to, you know, now we're clinically
[SPEAKER_02]: managing people's pain using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and a lot of other things in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where where I sit right now,
I still have a very large or not large,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, but I have a very active academic
research program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you're aware, the federal
constraints for studying cannabis are
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to get creative in how we're
answering some of the most burning
[SPEAKER_02]: questions that we have about cannabis and
its effects in people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the one of the projects that I'm
the most excited about in pretty much all
[SPEAKER_02]: of my life is the work that I do outside
of academia with our company, Smart
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, the the the cool thing about
this project is that we get to answer some
[SPEAKER_02]: really fundamental questions about what
does cannabis do in human beings,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy human beings, and the way that
we've structured it, we can answer these
[SPEAKER_02]: really exciting questions in a way that
doesn't violate any laws and doesn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of academic
researchers in the cannabis field have had
[SPEAKER_02]: to get very creative in how they do their
work in order to answer the kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for instance, I have a colleague at
Washington State University, Carrie
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutler, and she does essentially
psychometric testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gives people, you know, computer tests
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over Zoom, because that way she can have
this person do a dab over Zoom instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: illegally doing a dab inside her
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is this is what I mean with being
creative and how we're answering these
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, yeah, at the moment, you know,
I've built my academic work up over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years, NIH grant by NIH grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and now I do sort of tandem projects
both inside and outside of academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what drew you to cannabis in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more just out of personal
curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of your focus
initially was on the medical side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now you're looking at sort of its
effects both medically and recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that my draw initially,
like really, really early in my career as
[SPEAKER_02]: as an undergrad was pure scientific
curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was looking at these two
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Opioids and cannabinoids, both of which
were used as pain relievers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew that if you use two drugs
together at the same time, often they
[SPEAKER_02]: amplify one another's effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was true and continues to be true
for both of these drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I came into it as a
skeptic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was a straight edge,
hardcore punk rock kid and I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: super anti drugs and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I was really interested in
addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I saw all the
literature for myself and produced some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that evidence myself that was like,
huh, there's really something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, sure enough, you keep
following the evidence over decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very compelling story that this
is this is clearly a safer drug compared
[SPEAKER_02]: to opioids when it comes to pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and even, you know, if we're talking
about from a pure altered state of
[SPEAKER_02]: consciousness perspective, altering your
consciousness with cannabis is arguably
[SPEAKER_02]: more safe than doing so with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, yeah, over the years, I came to
follow the evidence to understand both the
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic value and the harm reduction
value that cannabis poses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where that's where I sit
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the relative safety of
cannabis compared to other things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: put into our body, both for a therapeutic
purpose and for a purely personal reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really is true that this is a
relatively safe, innocuous substance that
[SPEAKER_02]: that most healthy adults can use for a
variety of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the way that you ask the
question kind of pits medical use against
[SPEAKER_02]: adult use as a binary choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I do see this as a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one individual can fall anywhere on
that spectrum, even multiple times a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can fall in different places on that
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the the ability of this
plant to produce such wide different kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of chemistry matches up with the ability
of the human to use many different kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants for many different kinds of
purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I I do I do very much see it as
a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where all of my work is
is based on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a really good point
you brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the legislation that has
created this medical versus recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of binary path.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when you're right, there are all
these outcomes and effects that people
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with cannabis that that it's
not really accurate to to split it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just going to say that's even
been recently reflected in the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've seen that if you go into a
dispensary in Colorado, a recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary and you ask people why they're
there, 60 or 70 percent of them will say
[SPEAKER_02]: either I'm here to get something to help
me sleep or relieve my pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like it's we see it also
played out in Oregon where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time, we had the OMMP,
the the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers of participants in that
program have been dwindling over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that those patients are going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not using the medical program
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the other thing about cannabis
is that it is a very self empowering tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and we we tend to find that
with any kind of patient, when they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they are responsible for or at least
they're they're in control of their own
[SPEAKER_02]: health, that that tends to be a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ability of people to take this
medical tool into their own hands and use
[SPEAKER_02]: it to the degree that suits them,
you know, that's kind of a win win.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have empowerment and you have a
personalized approach to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're kind of on opposite sides of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting because I
came to cannabis sort of like you did in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that I wasn't I wasn't a big
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never even tried cannabis till I was
33, I think, for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was I was so afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went hiking in the woods and took one
little puff and I didn't know what what
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of experiences I would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was just I was a control freak
and I didn't like the idea of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting that like
Michael Pollan highlights the the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all every society, every culture,
human culture attempts to alter their
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness in one way or another
through the use of plant based medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that interests me most most
about your research from a personal level
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I have I find that I have very
different effects with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of my friends and other people
in the industry, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons my focus has always been on like
cultivation and providing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, clean flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that to me is the most interesting
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, like I know these
effects are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like for me with effects, I I would if
I smoke most flowers, I will get I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: sleepy, but I won't fail to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain will just race a million miles an
hour and then I'll just eat everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I seem to have that effect across
across a variety of different cultivars to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not as appealing to me as,
you know, maybe other other things like
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned, alcohol, which I agree
is way worse than than cannabis in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that everyone has different
sort of effects when they consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of one of the things that
you guys are discovering and researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you start to share a little bit about
some of that research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be delighted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I want to recognize,
you know, like, thank you for sharing your
[SPEAKER_02]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it is extremely common
amongst people and very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I and exactly our process
through the cultivation classic is
[SPEAKER_02]: designed to support exactly this thing
that you're describing, which is that
[SPEAKER_02]: engaging with cannabis is a risky
behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is that you are
taking a gamble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily know what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can follow your budtender's
recommendations and you can go based on
[SPEAKER_02]: your previous experiences or maybe you
have a friend who is well versed in
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're making a buying decision
at the dispensary counter, for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part, you are not really guaranteed
whatever kind of experience, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you think you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's exactly what our process is
designed to support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make it a less, you know,
less of a gamble, you know, maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyment at minimum risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the wonderful thing
about the cultivation classic is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not only are we really focusing
on organic, like regenerative kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, which we know is best practice,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We the cannabis industry isn't going to
exist 20 years from now if we burn out the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet or if we burn out the people who
are using the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's why, you know,
this this particular cup has always been
[SPEAKER_02]: so focused on, you know, plants that don't
use salt and mineral fertilizers that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we really reward cultivators
who are, you know, minimizing their carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint and producing sustainable
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Oregon, what what the competition
looks like is that, you know, we accept
[SPEAKER_02]: entries from throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, we had roughly 50 cultivators
and a total of 150 flowers, which we then
[SPEAKER_02]: put through a very rigorous analytical
chemistry panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, use one laboratory,
the best laboratory we can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, it was Cascadia, who
unfortunately is no longer in the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: market, but they're doing great work in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a nice list of all the
cannabinoids and all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we take that flower and we distribute
it to our consumer ambassadors,
[SPEAKER_02]: our judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do this in a double blind,
randomized fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is that I don't know
what flowers my judges are getting and
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't know what flowers they're
getting either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just in, you know, jars with a
four digit number.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next level of that process is that,
first of all, they take a tolerance break
[SPEAKER_02]: 48 hours before they start engaging with
the plants in their kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our judges get about 10 flowers per kit
and they've got 30 days to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, you know, that this is a
key distinguishing factor from other kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of widely known that
other, you know, competitions,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to call them that,
you know, there's a bunch of flowers that
[SPEAKER_02]: get consumed around a conference table and
it's not exactly an objective evaluation
[SPEAKER_02]: of which flower was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an extremely rigorous process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that our judges have
the time to mindfully complete an
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment of the flowers that are in
their kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we give them a nice long
period of time to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of that, what we've got
is a very valuable data set in that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got high fidelity plan information,
double blinded assessment, and
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically the feedback tool that we've
designed, you know, that our judges log in
[SPEAKER_02]: to our tool and they provide their answers
to, you know, a survey digitally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can really delve into questions,
not just like, you know, on a scale of one
[SPEAKER_02]: to 10, how much did you like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: But was the experience desirable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the aroma desirable?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are your tasting notes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it make your body and your
emotions and your cognition feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: We delve into all of those deeper
questions so that we can really get a more
[SPEAKER_02]: granular idea of exactly what affects
these kinds of flowers had in healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: human beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this is this kind of process
takes a lot of effort and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's, you know,
that kind of investment is uncommon in a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of those other events that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I just I want to start off by
saying I've been to the Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic twice now, maybe three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you guys are doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get more involved with it
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking with Steph about that,
hopefully for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great program and a great cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think you are doing the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can at sort of controlling as many
variables as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had around that,
though, was, do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for people consuming at
the same time of day or same day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, you know, I assume people would
have a different effect if they had just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, won the lottery and then smoked
one of the flowers versus if they had just
[SPEAKER_00]: broken up with their girlfriend and smoked
one of the flowers, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any way to account for those
sorts of fluctuations as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just it's a little too hard to
control?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, those are those are excellent
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a bench scientist, those are all
the exact kinds of variables I would love
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have learned that this is the
reality we live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: People consume at different times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they consume for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different kinds of, you know,
schedules and they have different
[SPEAKER_02]: routines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is going to be the case no matter
how small or how large, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry is or our sample
size is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want is to capture naturalistic
behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there we do ask a few things
to try and standardize, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the best of our ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some important questions,
you know, when our judges first register
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and level the playing field a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, you know, like there it is
a fact that people's experiences and
[SPEAKER_02]: routines are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their expectations are different and we
have to capture the reality out there in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I do agree that under ideal
laboratory kinds of conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: we might have, you know, smaller noise in
the data and might be able to detect
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns a little bit more easily if that
noise is less prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, you know, we we have to we
have to live in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just to be clear, this isn't a
problem that just exists in measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This exists across all health research or
anything involving a human subject where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't put them in a vacuum and expect
and test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you just it's a it's a
matter of collecting so much data that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, a good standard deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create a good mean effect and then
throw out all that data that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that noise that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a skews thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can you can get nice graphs down
the time over time if you collect enough
[SPEAKER_00]: information, I guess, is what I would say
around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of your findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I thought this was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start talking about THC in
general or would you like to cover some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the findings more specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk about this whole
Indica versus sativa thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot we could we could
start off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, let's let's start off with
what I think is probably the most
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful finding that we came across last
year was that, you know, so when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: assessing, we're digging through all the
data that we get at the end of our data
[SPEAKER_02]: collection period and we can make a
composite, you know, sort of enjoyment
[SPEAKER_02]: score, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if we if we look at how
enjoyable a flower is and then we rank
[SPEAKER_02]: them all from the most desirable,
you know, all the way down to 150th place,
[SPEAKER_02]: least desirable and zoom in on the top 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the top 10 most enjoyable flowers in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we notice immediately is that only
three of those 10 had more than 20 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that tells us that when you take the,
you know, the label off of a jar and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just give a human an ability, an
opportunity to enjoy the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: they tend to report that they like the
moderate potency flowers the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even our number four or number six
best performing flower only had six
[SPEAKER_02]: percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this this is incredibly
important because it highlights the legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: of prohibition, namely potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, you know, from the retail
intake manager to the consumer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: producer, there is this like perpetuation
of potency as the number one value in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I don't I don't blame people
for chasing this because historically,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the only information that we had
that, you know, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dank was always related directly to
THC potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what this data shows us is that
enjoyment and intoxication are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we we know that THC potency
is correlated with intoxication,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been demonstrated in the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's common knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can go home yourself and do
an experiment on yourself and know that
[SPEAKER_02]: more potent flowers mean more
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, more intoxication doesn't
necessarily mean more enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this, you know, mythology that
the more potent flowers are the most
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable flowers, that the more potent
flowers are the most enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this data shows that they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think about potency from
the perspective of an addiction researcher
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we see in all illicit drug
markets, whether it is opioids or alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, in the days of prohibition
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition promotes potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because smugglers are trying to
pack as much of their stuff into the
[SPEAKER_02]: smallest package possible because they
have to move it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where potency comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite the fact that we have beautiful
legal markets and somewhat functional
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis economies, we're still dragging
around this legacy, which is completely
[SPEAKER_02]: irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A really nice comparison is with
moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, yeah, moonshine is
incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was easier to move
around than other kinds of alcohol because
[SPEAKER_02]: it had so much alcohol, you know,
in the smallest package possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not in the moonshine days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're as, you know, as a consumer
going to a dispensary counter,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could make the moonshine decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if I were given the opportunity,
if those products existed, I could choose,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a nice glass of cabsaws or a
fine, hazy IPA or a farmhouse ale or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a barrel aged whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are so many other experiences
that are possible if we go, if we dip
[SPEAKER_02]: below the intoxication level that
moonshine provides us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple of questions,
but I want to start with the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this enjoyment score.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, does that taking into account,
like when we talked about medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the therapeutic benefits,
is that sort of factored into that
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyment score as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of things look at that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we steer very, very clear of any
medically relevant questions other than
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe asking about, you know, undesirable
side effects, which you, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: could argue that a racing cart is a,
you know, an adverse outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we're really trying to see,
you know, like what is enjoyable and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's least likely to produce,
you know, something undesirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, we're steering clear from medical
utility because if you're doing a double
[SPEAKER_02]: blind randomized, you know, if you're
assigning products to people in a double
[SPEAKER_02]: blind randomized fashion and you're asking
them medically relevant questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're conducting a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently that is not legal in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it seems like you could down the
road look at this and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular flower, you know,
reduced my pain on a pain scale by this
[SPEAKER_00]: much versus this other flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, that makes a lot of sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a pain researcher, there is
absolutely nothing that I would be more
[SPEAKER_02]: delighted to do than ask that very
question of these two products,
[SPEAKER_02]: which of them made your pain better?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that, that is, that's something
that myself and my colleagues would,
[SPEAKER_02]: would our longing to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm understanding correctly,
basically what I'm hearing is that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this idea of THC being sort of a
marker for evaluating cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we should, hopefully as a,
as a society we'll stop, stop doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we need a better tools for
evaluating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what smart cannabis and
your, your company is looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish for people as a way for them to
better evaluate the effects of these
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, um, before they, before
purchasing based on the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: available data, is that, does that sound
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to empower the consumer to be able
to make choices that promote enjoyment and
[SPEAKER_02]: that are, and we know at least from this
data that enjoyment and THC don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the other really interesting
data points from this year, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually we've seen this for a couple
of years in a row now is the importance of
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw, you know, we have really nice
correlation between the aroma of a flower
[SPEAKER_02]: and the effects that are produced by that
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I mean by that is,
you know, if we look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, um, how, how much a person enjoys a
particular flower, um, then that is likely
[SPEAKER_02]: to be correlated with how good that flower
smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the better a flower smells,
the more likely it is that a consumer is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to enjoy the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we also saw a correlation
between the aroma and euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So euphoria and enjoyment are,
are two different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different things from our perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Euphoria is a mood state.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel emotionally happy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is a preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it kind of makes sense that if
you're happy, you're going to like it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we, we find that that is related to
the aroma of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in the cultivation community
and your listeners will probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: this will ring very true to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that old saying, the nose knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, at, at our, at our award
ceremony in May, we have the nose nose
[SPEAKER_02]: award for an exemplary cultivar that
smells great, that produces a really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: psychological state in our people and
makes them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about more of your
findings, but I, a question popped in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head while you were talking about this,
that I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along with the challenges of sort of
identifying, uh, these variables and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and creating this, these graphs,
around these flowers, how do you account
[SPEAKER_00]: for variability among a given cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, when we talk about like a chemo,
our expression, something that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy plum is really passionate about and
talk and go dives into, do you see this
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming like the wine industry where the
2017 OG Kush that was grown outdoors on
[SPEAKER_00]: this farm was sort of that, you know,
created this one experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next year, it may be a different
experience altogether, because they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have changed something in the soil
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've received more water,
more sunlight, you know, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a tricky question,
which I think will, a we're working on it
[SPEAKER_02]: and B we'll take some time to really fully
develop and it'll need some consensus
[SPEAKER_02]: among the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, from my perspective,
like the most conservative thing is to say
[SPEAKER_02]: that you always have a novel cultivar,
no matter if you put the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not, you know, it is even under very
tightly controlled growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, artificial intelligence
controlled greenhouse stuff, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even under those tightly
controlled conditions with genetics that
[SPEAKER_02]: are identical harvest to harvest,
we have genetic drift, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have environmental changes that very
profoundly affect phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from my perspective, every single
time we produce a certificate of analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: for cultivar, it's a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a totally new thing every single
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think, you know, unlike wine,
I think it'll be much more difficult to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, routinely produce the exact same
chemistry time after time after time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're getting closer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think that, you know,
Jeremy's a prime example of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the level of rigor it takes to get those
harvest to harvest really, really
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducible outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm again, like, I'm OK with this,
you know, this is the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of variability in this plant
because it is crazy sensitive to its
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the case, then great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that there is work to be
done in creating rough categories of
[SPEAKER_02]: chemovars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is, you know, we have our types
one, two and three are THC dominant and
[SPEAKER_02]: then hemp like, you know, flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then within those, there probably is
some further, you know, chemotaxonomy
[SPEAKER_02]: that's related to the terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even, you know, we're looking at hops
and we're looking at other, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that a lot of the aroma from
hops doesn't necessarily come from
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from other molecules that don't
currently appear on anyone's certificate
[SPEAKER_02]: of analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally not on the radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this is this is something
that, you know, I think that it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be this is what's the most exciting thing
to me about cannabis is that it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary on a trench, both in terms of the
chemicals it produces, as well as what
[SPEAKER_02]: those chemicals do in the people that are
consuming the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have many, many decades of discovery
ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, we're currently working on a
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using this data set from the
Cultivation Classic in partnership with
[SPEAKER_02]: some colleagues in California to see,
like, OK, if we can model different chemo
[SPEAKER_02]: types, you know, what kinds of buckets of
cannabis are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then can we create a predictive model
which will then, you know, fit these new,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cultivars that are coming out
and put those into those different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, chemotaxonomic buckets?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you mentioned smell and
we talked a little bit about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have some terpene data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I learned I
wasn't aware of was that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for a long time was mercy,
mercy dominant primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're starting over the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing more variability in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what
you're what you're seeing in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability now in terpenes and what
effects people are reporting related to
[SPEAKER_00]: that data?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the effect thing is tricky
because our data set would tell us that
[SPEAKER_02]: the mindset of the person is the most
predictive thing, the mindset and the
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma are the most predictive thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this person expects it to have an
indica like response, then it's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's going to do for them,
which is not that surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at cannabis essentially or THC
being a mild classic psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at all the other classic
psychedelic drugs, the mindset prior to
[SPEAKER_02]: ingesting the drug is a huge component in
the ultimate outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an expectation that this
product is going to do this for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, with the data that we
currently have, it's not sufficiently
[SPEAKER_02]: large enough to detect these patterns,
not to mention the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not just looking at the effect of
Mircein.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at the effect of Mircein in
combination with all of this other huge
[SPEAKER_02]: host of chemicals that, you know,
polypharmacy is a completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: ballgame than, you know, just taking
Mircein on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if we look at what we've
seen in the data this year compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: last year, one of the things that's
unfortunate is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see a lot of plants that tend to be
more similar to one another compared to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, different from one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would really like to see all the
freaks we would love for people to submit
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers that are very unique and very
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have seen is that,
you know, compared to last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have way more turpinoline-dominant
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this is, you know,
for some of the old school folks out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, Dutch treat, the smell of Dutch
treat, that's a turpinoline-dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tends to be also a very potent aroma,
intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like a lot of people can
detect, oh, I don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different types of weed from one
another, but I can smell turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very distinct aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something has a citrus aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tends to be really distinct in
people's minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like five out of seven
judges can easily detect a citrus aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they don't have to be trained in
sensory evaluation to go, yep,
[SPEAKER_02]: this smells like citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, and I think that that speaks to,
you know, trends, you know, just like
[SPEAKER_02]: perfume.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have, you know, a number of years
ago, sandalwood was really popular and
[SPEAKER_02]: there are all these perfumes on the market
that smelled like sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then oud was really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oud oil was very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many perfumes out there that had
oud as their, you know, primary aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I can suspect that if we
allow the market to be driven by the
[SPEAKER_02]: sensory experience of cannabis,
that we would see very similar trends that
[SPEAKER_02]: things would wax and wane over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpinoline might, you know, turpinoline
might have been hot this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe next year we'll have
pining-dominant, you know, cultivars as
[SPEAKER_02]: our front runners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you also found research around gender
too, if that's right, what I remember from
[SPEAKER_00]: the presentation with Steph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to touch on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so gender is a social construct
and specifically the question we asked was
[SPEAKER_02]: biological sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we asked the question that
way is because we know from the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: literature that cannabis affects
biological males and biological females
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are different rates of the
development of tolerance to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different effects on our
hormonal systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was important for us to see,
you know, can we actually detect a sex
[SPEAKER_02]: difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And are there kinds of cannabis that are
biologically better suited for men and
[SPEAKER_02]: women or biological men and women?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we were able to,
you know, use all of the data to find,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a cultivar, you know,
we found cultivars that were liked equally
[SPEAKER_02]: amongst men and women.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are like outstanding flowers that
won for whatever other reason that they
[SPEAKER_02]: won.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were able to find, you know,
one standout flower that produced a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice effect and a very desirable aroma for
women.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the men were kind of like,
meh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one that we deemed that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Ladies' Choice Award.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just so happens to be my personal
favorite as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a type two with, you know,
roughly six percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lovely, lovely cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for correcting me on the
biological versus gender differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize the way that came across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally for myself, the one flower
that I really enjoyed happened to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: type two flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called Kava that was grown by up here by a
company called Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, these type twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the type twos have very,
I think that this is where we have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of promise in the future of the industry
is with these type twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like like you were saying,
your personal experience with cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, yeah, like you might feel sleepy,
but your mind is going crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's very endearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, you know, what's the best way
to kind of control that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I'd say a lot of people
are addicted of, frankly, a THC overdose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's possible below that threshold of
intoxication?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you know, there's two ways you can
do that, you can slowly dial back from 20
[SPEAKER_02]: and 30 percent flowers and see what you
feel, or you could work your way up from
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, starting with a heady hemp
product and then, you know, especially for
[SPEAKER_02]: a new consumer who has an The easiest way
to not have a bad time is to not consume
[SPEAKER_02]: too much THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is where I think those type
two flowers are really valuable because
[SPEAKER_02]: one, they're balanced with CBD,
which has experimentally been shown to
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce the paranoia and anxiety that's
produced by THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're consuming them in roughly
equal amounts, great, you're protecting
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself from that paranoia to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got enough THC on board to get
yourself into the therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is if we look in
medicine, every drug has a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: window where you have to take a certain
dose or the patient feels it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take too high of a dose,
then negative side effects start to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is exactly the same with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take it out of the context of
medicine and just look at enjoyment,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to get up into the therapeutic
window so that you can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't take so much that now you
have racing thoughts, racing heart,
[SPEAKER_02]: dry eyes, dry mouth, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these type two flowers have an immense
potential to have wide appeal across many
[SPEAKER_02]: different kinds of people for many
different kinds of purposes because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just less risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fits with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things Jeff Lowenfeld said,
he was asked, you know, what's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: potent flower you've ever tried and things
like that and all these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what he what he said around
it, which I thought was a good point,
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, hey, we don't need to go
stronger and stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's that's not the that's not the
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you can always, you know,
take another hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can always have a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop trying to get this,
you know, like you said, like these 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 percent THC dominant flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, it sounds like your research is
sort of supporting that concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually have some data to support
that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'm wondering is how how
does this impact growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, how can I use this
information to better cultivate and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: my product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this I love this question so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for asking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start with the answer with an
anecdote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of our judges is also a cultivator
in the cultivation classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and he's been involved in this process
since the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always submitted flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he's always been a judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have missed the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in one of his early years,
you know, we gave him his feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: We revealed at the end, hey, these are all
the flowers that you like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: To find that some of his most favorable
responses were to flowers that had a
[SPEAKER_02]: really high CBD content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was kind of bummed because he had
absolutely zero CBD in his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did he do?
[SPEAKER_02]: He went back and he introduced some CBD
and some more balanced phytochemistry into
[SPEAKER_02]: his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, their business is doing
really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got wonderful, wonderful products on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not all that surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you ask these cultivators,
like, what is your what is your most
[SPEAKER_02]: treasured flower that you're producing?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them will say, oh, man,
I've got this purple girl who's like 14 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smells like, you know, Flintstone
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just the most beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's transcendental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't sell it because it's less than 20
percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cultivators already know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the consumers, if they're if they ever
have an opportunity to try and get a
[SPEAKER_02]: moderate potency flower, they often will
also say, yeah, I can only take one hit or
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't it be nice if I could take two
hits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, because I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, those potent flowers,
just it's not fun for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the customer often knows that sometimes
they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's still a ton of THC
hunting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the customer, you know, is starting to
realize that, you know, potency is not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cultivator knows it and the
consumer sometimes knows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a really critical sort of
choke point at the intake level at retail
[SPEAKER_02]: intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've talked to retail intake managers
in Washington who literally tell me my
[SPEAKER_02]: boss won't let me buy any flowers that has
less than 17 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those flowers have literally been cut out
of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those ones that fit so beautifully in
the therapeutic window that are so
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderfully produced in the full sun with
a rich terpene profile and moderate
[SPEAKER_02]: potency, those flowers that are the most
enjoyable are ironically the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: least likely to be found on the dispensary
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we address that as a society?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we educate consumers to select
flowers that are going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable?
[SPEAKER_00]: For them over time, how do we move away
from this sort of THC dominant thought
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that it requires this is a
big problem that doesn't have one
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to address the problem
from multiple angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we clearly need widespread PSA
level information like, hey, you're too
[SPEAKER_02]: high on a billboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need, you know, bud tenders
and intake managers who have the education
[SPEAKER_02]: as well to be able to pass on that
knowledge directly at the counter where
[SPEAKER_02]: when they have a consumer who comes in and
says, what's the most THC I can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for my six dollars a gram,
then the bud tender can say, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you you could take that moonshine route.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't you also try this other
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, like, yeah,
that'll get you messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have this other thing which might
actually be more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it is a multimodal
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have bud tenders who really not
only get this information, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: experience it for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the intake managers are open to
producing higher values, monetary values
[SPEAKER_02]: for type two flowers and flowers with
moderate potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, like a wide
spread public education campaign about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like THC ain't always cracked up
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I hope you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern is, is it from a growing
perspective as a cultivator?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's risky to try and cultivate
a flower that's under 17 percent that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not sell sell on the on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to use this data as a
consumer facing approach to where this
[SPEAKER_00]: could be near the flower or out by the
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can say, hey, we're seeing these
responses on this flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the huge benefits from
our process is that we're able to take
[SPEAKER_02]: this data and feed it back to the
cultivator and feed it back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our judges at the end, you know,
they get access to all of their you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we unblind them and tell them what they
like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, wow, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, that cultivator
anecdote that I told you earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I would love to see that
deployed at a larger scale level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some projects that we're
working on that are moving toward that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really enabling the consumer to
have a personalized experience that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is is based on their own
experience with different cultivars of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you're absolutely right that
this is a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to all of the the,
you know, decisions at whole scale and
[SPEAKER_02]: retail level are currently being made on
historical data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking backwards to see what sold
last quarter and a quarter before that and
[SPEAKER_02]: a quarter before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we're assuming that the
future is 100 percent dependent upon the
[SPEAKER_02]: path when really what we need is to not
ask, you know, what do people think they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to buy?
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, what do people actually need?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's less looking backward to see what
sold previously and more looking forward
[SPEAKER_02]: about what people will be buying in the
future because it's a more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's precisely what this what this
project is aimed at doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see for the future of this
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've kind of touched on it a
little bit, but was there anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted to add to that in terms of what
you're seeing or how you what direction
[SPEAKER_00]: you see is going?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that what we have
learned from other agricultural products
[SPEAKER_02]: is that, you know, as things happen with
corporate consolidation, there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: trend toward monocropping and producing an
agricultural product for yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: producing a product for yield at scale is
like the entirely opposite thing that our
[SPEAKER_02]: data reveals, which is that these,
you know, craft types of artisan flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: are the ones that tend to be the most
diverse and terpenes, the most interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: and and desirable smelling and the ones
that produce the most enjoyable
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would hope that this
industry would take an evidence based
[SPEAKER_02]: approach as well as a practical one in
that we need to have sustainable products
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't, you know, pulling resources
out of this earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be putting products into
our bodies that don't burn out our
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid systems and put us at risk
for cannabis use disorder and hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the other health risks that are
associated with potent THC products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely understand where how we got
to the place we are, where everyone is
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to push their certificates of
analysis up to that 30 percent mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is that when you give
people a chance to consume cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_02]: blinded fashion, that's just not what they
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to take some growing
pains and I think it's going to take some
[SPEAKER_02]: leaps of faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take, you know, a small part
of the garden dedicated to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice moderate potency flower and just
kind of cross your fingers and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens with that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that there is a moderate path
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think it makes sense to
completely just like flip the market
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight where all of a sudden,
you know, nobody is growing 25 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the slow introduction of, you know,
more diverse products is wise because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have more diverse people than ever before
using cannabis for more diverse reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: than ever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you think about your
Fourth of July barbecue, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got kids in the pool and the
barbecue is on and every adult in the yard
[SPEAKER_02]: is standing there with a beer in their
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at any point, something happens with
one of the kids in the pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, any adult can drop the beer,
put the kid in the car and get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: emergency room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is the equivalent of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what what kind of cannabis is the I
can still drive and I can take my kids to
[SPEAKER_02]: the emergency room kind of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the, you know, Sunday afternoon
hype?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: yoga before I have to go to work and be at
my desk at 9 a.m.?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there there are lots of
different kinds of people using cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for more reasons than ever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would make sense to produce lots of
diverse products, which would fit all of
[SPEAKER_02]: those diverse needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one question I forgot to ask you
that I was thinking of is, did you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between outdoor versus indoor
grown flour on these scales or is that
[SPEAKER_00]: something you tracked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know you haven't looked at
organic versus conventionally grown
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that on the radar at all either?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, we don't really have any
interest in looking at conventionally
[SPEAKER_02]: grown cannabis because we believe that
organically grown cannabis is the right
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that, you know, this is better
for the Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better for the human.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't foresee that we're going to be
looking at conventionally grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have definitely looked at light type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I go back to those that the top 10,
you know, the most enjoyable to least
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyable, I believe the majority of those
were cultivated with supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that we ask the question is,
you know, like this could be any
[SPEAKER_02]: supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be in a greenhouse with some
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, with a greenhouse,
we also or a hoop house, you often still
[SPEAKER_02]: get the full spectrum that, you know,
a sun only flower would get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how that's how we differ things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I mean, people like both indoor
and outdoor ones, you know, equally it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you from a phytochemical level,
we see the most diverse, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we tend to see the widest array of
terpenes expressed by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers that are produced in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that just based on the
spectrum analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned cannabis and I'm going to
mispronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you say that word?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hyper emesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any research to support what
is causing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people correlate it supposedly
with azadirachtin and neem and a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people blame it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a variety of things and
theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any actual research on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very active field and I can tell
you 100 percent it comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: overstimulating the endogenous cannabinoid
system with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not related to toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not related to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a side effect of neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that theory, you know,
kind of went viral and it was very widely
[SPEAKER_02]: adopted for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in looking at, you know,
both zooming in to the receptors where
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids bind, you know, at the
molecular level, as well as everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's reported by physicians in the
emergency departments who are treating
[SPEAKER_02]: these people who have hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the evidence is pointing toward
this is a cannabinoid mediated effect
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with the endogenous
cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be causing people that are
extremely heavy users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something that it builds up over
time and then it can hit at any point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there are there things that are
triggering it for certain users?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it's not cultivar specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are related in any way or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these are all excellent
questions that I think we have some
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence to support that, yes,
you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This this tends to happen in heavy users,
you know, people who use very frequently
[SPEAKER_02]: for very long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know exactly which molecules may
be contributing or that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which chemo bars or cultivars of cannabis
are contributing to this effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it it makes it makes sense
that a lot of these heavy users are using
[SPEAKER_02]: very potent products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very, very likely that it is a
THC mediated effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what how you could balance
that risk with, you know, a more diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar, a type two cultivar that had
more CBD, totally unknown at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, it's going to be a long time
before we understand that, because we need
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal guidelines to turn around so
that we can do that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of research and collect that data,
you know, in a controlled manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad we got to touch on that,
too, because it's something that's been in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of my brain for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to hear some real information
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I really appreciate you coming
on the show today and sharing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, because I think that I hope this is
the direction of cannabis consumption in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need these science based
tools to really make informed decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know here in Washington, we're not
allowed to even smell the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make that correlation between
smell and enjoyment, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, was there anything else you
wanted to share with listeners before
[SPEAKER_00]: before I let you go for the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, like I, you know,
briefly, I think that what you've just
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned is a huge problem for consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here we have data telling us
that this is the most important indicator
[SPEAKER_02]: of an enjoyable experience and aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet you're completely depriving the
consumer of the ability to make an
[SPEAKER_02]: informed decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're forcing them to make a decision
based on potency, which we know is bad
[SPEAKER_02]: because potency promotes all of the health
risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would love if your
regulators in Washington and in California
[SPEAKER_02]: and in all those other markets where,
you know, consumers aren't allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: smell the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we need to be able to pass this
information on and say, hey, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a really important biological
decision making factor that it's not fair
[SPEAKER_02]: to deprive the consumers of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't be the first time regulation got
in the way of things that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you mentioned odor and odor
is another a whole nother topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, because it is so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned that there are even
terpenes that we aren't even measuring at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, potentially, or understanding,
like with your allusion to hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even necessarily terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are other aromatic
compounds that produce aromas that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so we have aldehydes and ketones
and other molecules that are present in
[SPEAKER_02]: hops and in grapes and in roses and in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have those other molecules
that produce aromas that are not terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: or terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody is nobody's looking for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and you're absolutely right that,
you know, the sensory component is a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: other, you know, 60 minute episode in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like what smells are there and
in what intensity and who can who can
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiate between them and who is
sensitive to these smells and who isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is what is that more rigorous
relationship between the aroma and the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is yeah, it's a huge area of
opportunity for exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm super grateful to have you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope maybe I can get you guys back
on as more research, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out in what you guys are studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot more projects planned for
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be a pleasure to come back and
share our updated findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I will see you guys at the
Cultivation Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least, I plan on attending
have we have you set a date for 2020 yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the last weekend in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's after Memorial Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and people can go to
CultivationClassic.cc to check out that
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put all the information
relating to this website and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the data if you're open to sharing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put that on the website podcast
page, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will look forward to talking again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
