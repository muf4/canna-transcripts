[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Tad Hussey with Kiss Organics and
I'm here today with Suzanne Wade Wright
[SPEAKER_01]: Evans of Bug Lady Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are here to talk a little bit about
different tools for scouting and bug
[SPEAKER_01]: identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things you might want to consider when
looking at bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne, do you want to start off and talk
about some of the tools you use when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, the most important thing,
and I always tell everybody I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a Nerda bag that you can put all your
tools in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan of the Fanny pack because
you can snap it on and it leaves your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands free to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sure enough, if you don't have the
tool with you, you're going to need it and
[SPEAKER_00]: this way you can carry everything with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: REI does not make this bag anymore,
but you can find it on eBay occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is about the perfect size
for carrying almost everything you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this probably 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all kinds of stuff in it,
which the different tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think first and foremost,
the number one most basic scouting tool
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have is a 10x hand lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, which I really like,
has a built-in LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's especially helpful for if you're in a
darker situation, for either like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at plants in the interior
scape or if you're in a darker grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as you get older, having more
light for your eyes is really super
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are really inexpensive to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone on your team should probably
carry one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always put them on a lanyard because if
not, they're really easy to get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this can give you that quick first
initial look at something to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision on do I need to collect a sample,
then to use with my microscope or your
[SPEAKER_00]: other USB microscopes or your other tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the 10x there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they come in a variety of different
magnifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any advantage to having other
magnifications or do you just find
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself using the 10x?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any insects you're not going to
be able to see, let's say with a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, for example, with a 10x lens where
you need something better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also have a 20x and I have a 30x and
I always come back to the 10x.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get to the 20 and 30,
the lenses are a bit smaller and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have as big as field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to make sure you have
enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though my eyes are pretty bad at
this point, I can see hemp russet mites
[SPEAKER_00]: with this 10x hand lens on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about as small as you're going
to need to see from an insect or a mite
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have another thing here that a grower
recommended that I thought I'd get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it's from Carson.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another tool for looking at
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk about the pros and
cons of something like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've never used this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just showed it to you five minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you had a stationary leaf,
maybe if you want to look at how we mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: or something and you wanted to come down
over top of it, that would work well to
[SPEAKER_00]: look down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's good that it has a built-in
LED light and you can focus and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to hold leaf samples
out in the greenhouse, I think it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little more challenging to work
with from that standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know it does have significantly
higher magnification, but this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'd more use at a desk with
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what's challenging too is if you
have small leaves and you try to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: over top of them, because sometimes it can
be challenging with the Dynalite to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the field of view in here wasn't super
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, would I buy one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably because I collect all this kind
of stuff, but I don't know how much I
[SPEAKER_00]: would use it from an insect and my
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I want to talk about when it
comes to stuff like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was under $20.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about buying something
for magnification, a lot of it comes down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The objective, correct me if you disagree
with anything I say here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the amount of light that you need
relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go to higher magnifications,
you need more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to keep in mind too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk a little more about
microscopes, but the quality objective on
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this with a, with a cheap
$20 tool is not going to be that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not, you're not, this is not
going to replace a higher quality option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to really look closely at an
insect or even take a picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't going to function for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like, like you said,
Suzanne, you've been using these loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your go-to things, you know,
having, like you said, a graveyard of
[SPEAKER_01]: these back home and ending up still using
the loop every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need all of these gadgets,
but they're kind of fun to play around
[SPEAKER_01]: with too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on to the next, let's talk
about what's in your bag besides just
[SPEAKER_01]: these microscope related scouting tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you had a few other things that you
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that before we talk about
the dynamite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is definitely a critical part of
my tool bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is I get these vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can order these from bioquip,
which is an insect supply company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, if anybody ever wants to
send me a gift card to bioquip,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love shopping because they've got all
the entomology tools you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just ordered these vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I preload them with alcohol and then,
um, these cards I absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what alcohol are you using in
these and where do you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do these things cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the vials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what type of alcohol do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now with COVID, any alcohol I can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been a real issue trying to
get alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your alcohol is way too high,
um, it can evaporate really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you don't get Nalgene caps,
alcohol does evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally for what I'm doing where I'm
just collecting samples, ferrying them
[SPEAKER_00]: back home, going to put them under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not storing these for years for museum
specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to store them for a long time,
you need the Nalgene caps, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: from, um, to, to do that, to keep it from
evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of, in a way kind of goes
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are actually white balance cards
from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually up to $9 now a package,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they used to be like five and in this
you get three of these cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what these are used for is,
um, white balancing your camera and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, if anybody's ever taken pictures
under LED lights, you know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you white balance,
uh, your camera so that your colors are
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found is these make a great
tool for sampling and scouting for
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hold this under a plant and then I
just bang the plant and then aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, thrips, mites, things like that can
fall on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the pack you do get gray,
black and white cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use white all the time,
but now I use black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it just, it works better for my
eyes to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if like an aphid falls on here,
you can take a paint brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I buy these by the 50 pack on
Amazon and you just dip the, the paint
[SPEAKER_00]: brush in alcohol and then you can go on
this plastic board and you can pick up the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect and then dip it back in the
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got your thrips,
your mites, your aphids in the alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't damage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can collect the insects off the
board and put them in the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your samples that then
you can either, um, put under your
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope for identification or send off
to extension or someone to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: identification on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this also is a great way just to
scout, even if you're not collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens, just walking by and knocking
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a video on my Instagram
account where we were doing this in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental greenhouse and you could just
see the thrips raining out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you looked at the plants,
they looked good, but we didn't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips were there until we knocked the
plants and they fell on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could see them very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help speed up your scouting and
make you more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite, favorite
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I always carry them with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say though, I've got tons of
the gray cards left because I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving these with growers all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have like this morgue of gray
cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray cards are the worst out of the
pack to see insects on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like because people say,
Oh, you can just do it on a white sheet of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like this because you can clean
this with alcohol at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no sticky on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this particular size I like too,
because it fits in most cargo pants
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these cards in like eight by
10 too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which might be more effective for some
people with larger plants to collect a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I absolutely love these cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's an essential part of
your, your scouting toolbox that you
[SPEAKER_00]: should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything else that you have in there,
uh, that you want to talk about before we
[SPEAKER_01]: go dive into, you know, more microscope
related?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I always carry tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have Sharpie markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, chapstick of course, but, um,
Zot's Ziploc baggies, um, binder clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually have a tiny screwdriver in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the stray gray card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, I also have a notebook
in case I need to write anything down in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes I have petri dishes in here
too, because if you take leaf samples and
[SPEAKER_00]: you put them in a Ziploc baggie,
you can get a lot of condensation buildup
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you put them back in your pouch,
they can get smushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So petri dishes will, um, not smush your
leaf and they're not sealed tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a little more breathability in
there with them, but they do take up more
[SPEAKER_00]: space, um, in your bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you were working at a facility
versus coming into consult, you may also
[SPEAKER_01]: have, um, a way of writing stuff down like
charting where you're seeing, where you
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where you're seeing this plant issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you've talked in the past about
using some sort of marker identification,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's like a colored plant stake
or, um, some way to note where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the color red means thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation flags are the best because
they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order them in lots of colors and
they're easy to see and you can just stand
[SPEAKER_00]: them in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we use those regularly in
ornamental production and you'll see where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll have PVC holders for each of the
different color flags on a little cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it could be, there's an
insect problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a disease problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an irrigation problem,
but you have to come up with your own
[SPEAKER_00]: system for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as record keeping, um,
there's actually more scouting software
[SPEAKER_00]: and companies that are becoming available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that really have got my interest
because it's going to give people the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to really map out their
greenhouse or map out their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then identify and keep good records on
population densities and what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if I'm home in Pennsylvania,
my growers in Colorado, I can go in to
[SPEAKER_00]: their daily scouting information and I can
see what's going on from remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things, um,
cause I have been going through
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations with all these companies
that provide scouting software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said it's important to have
remote access for the consultants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get in and view things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see if there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they have ways that you can take
pictures and then fold them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this summer at the Cultivate Show in
Columbus, Ohio, I'm actually teaching a
[SPEAKER_00]: full day scouting workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go out into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use these different
scouting tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have demos of different
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're actually going to have,
um, a setup where we're going to have lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of pest insects in a classroom setting to
work on identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have like a, um, essentially
in the software, I'm picturing somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have a zone, like zone A,
for example, and you could, you could mark
[SPEAKER_01]: that with mites and then you could post a
photo of that mite and then remotely
[SPEAKER_01]: someone like yourself could go in and
confirm the identification and then work
[SPEAKER_01]: with that scouting team to come up with a
plan for releases or sprays or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's interesting too,
because over time with these, some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these programs, you can build heat maps
and you can be like, Hey, why do we always
[SPEAKER_00]: end up with spider mites in that back
corner?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why over there, you know, after two
years, do we always have pattern mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start to see trends in pest
management and help you figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate those problems to prevent it from
happening next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're getting off topic like,
like we always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, let's talk about, um, the next
series of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you identify something with the loop
and you want to get a closer look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a tool to take a photo,
some way to capture the image.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows you to, or, or even just take
a closer look yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, for that you've recommended dino
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so you know, dino light does not
pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love dino light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I, yes, I, I own four of them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my dino light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mid tier option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this one was around $400, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we do carry them on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a $200 option that also works with
the slightly lower megapixel account.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have one of those here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has the fancier one and there's
even fancier than this one, she was
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in terms of scouting, um,
this is more than enough for the average
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the $200 one, I think we could safely
say would work for facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't need these unless you'd want
to do like real insect photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, and I will say this one,
this does disconnect and you can make this
[SPEAKER_00]: wireless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you dino light, but I don't like
that on this because anytime something is
[SPEAKER_00]: wireless, there's a little more of a delay
in taking photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see instantaneously the
picture I just took.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically, I mean, if,
if you needed to, if you were going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics and you're crawling through an
air conditioning shaft, I could see where
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it wireless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what we're doing, I don't think
that that extra expense is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plug into tablets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They plug and you can, so mine,
this is an adapter so I can run it into my
[SPEAKER_01]: Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Suzanne uses it with her windows
laptop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to show you, um, an over the
shoulder look next, uh, connected to this
[SPEAKER_01]: video where we'll show this and some other
microscope options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to talk about these
before we really dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's other brands that make lights
that look a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the big, the big deal here is the
quality of the objective and the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, the build itself to know that it's
going to last, that they have support for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have good software for capturing,
um, the image and, uh, anything else you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say about, I think that they have
the best photo capturing software for this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff, um, on the market and you
can put notes with the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the, so it's like in the metadata in
there, because I think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to make sure you track when you
take an insect image, what's the host
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, where you took it and all that kind
of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you take macro photos,
if you go back and look in the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to tell where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landscape images, yeah, you know where you
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macro stuff and you think you're going to
remember the plant cultivar, you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as you said, the tech support I
found extremely helpful, um, on these and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can connect these to your smartphones
too with, um, an adapter on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I, I actually use this through my
laptop often, and then I even love it more
[SPEAKER_00]: when I hook it up to my flat screen TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you can see it super big on the
screen because I like seeing big bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well let's pause this and come back with,
uh, it actually hooked up to a computer so
[SPEAKER_01]: we can show how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Suzanne, Suzanne, you have the fancy
dino light there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about the, can you want,
you want to talk a little about like what
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's buying just in a less
expensive, you know, middle of the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're not middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still fancy pants road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I like about the dino lights is
you have your magnification and focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: one wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll show you that in a second
where you can zoom in and focus right on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one wheel, but they also have this
soft touch button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you kind of, I've learned if I
angle it just right when I'm holding it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I hit it with my skin, just by brushing
this, it takes the photo in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to manually take the photo
on your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd get it held and you'd have to go
hit and it can jerk things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this soft touch button was one
of the biggest advancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I found having this on these units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, I don't know, maybe Tad will
show you a close up later, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: all the LED lights inside of there through
the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn the lights off and on and you
can control how much light you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you sometimes can see the LEDs
reflecting if you have very glossy
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, but they actually do make
diffusers that pop into there that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really worried about seeing the
individual lights, which sometimes I am
[SPEAKER_00]: for a photography purposes, but not
necessarily for identification purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's, there's two levels of
focus too with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can zoom in and then there's a
further zoom too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find with mine, or if I want to really
zoom in where it'll kind of come into
[SPEAKER_01]: focus at two different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me, so you're kind of moving
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to zoom in on your screen so
people can kind of see what's showing up
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a boy and that's a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now you have two spotted spider
mites on your screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a boy, two spotted spider mite,
and that's a female over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see there's an egg right
up there, but that glow you're getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the egg is actually the LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights reflecting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me zoom in a bit over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I need to look at my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what she's doing right here is just
kind of holding it either right on or at a
[SPEAKER_01]: slight angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with her thumb adjusting the
magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see right there, those spider
mite eggs right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see that weird lighting
ring in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a diffuser can stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, for scouting purposes,
now we know they're spider mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a leaf like this that has several of
these, um, mite eggs, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, very near future in a day
or two with an explosion of spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: on this cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here you can see the spider
mites walking through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can get her sitting right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see her distinctive,
you know, two spots on her back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how she gets her names,
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't always cooperate, but as long
as you can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now she's running away, but you could take
it one of these and drop it in alcohol or
[SPEAKER_01]: drop a drop of alcohol and then take a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is closer if you really want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were also saying just since we're
talking about two spotted on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, they can't have different
coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking today about aphids in
particular, but that you cannot use color
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way of identification with some of
these insects, um, which is important to
[SPEAKER_01]: note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can even see, it doesn't show so
much on your screen, but how this is way
[SPEAKER_00]: more green and darker than actually this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an adult male sitting right up
here, sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are skinnier and pointier on the
backside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the, the male sitting right
there, the male two spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the one above it,
if you count, it's a very young spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only has six legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're first born, they only have
six legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they grow up, then they'll
have eight legs like an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an immature two spot spider mite
back there with it's six legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the molting remains down below
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the cast skins off a two spot
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost, they almost crack in the middle
and then they come out of the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the front and the back half,
their mold left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one down here, um, is getting
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: To mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was telling you earlier,
they get this weird kind of sheen to them
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of do this rusting things before
they shed their skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since we, this is on the cannabis
leaf, by the way, uh, I also have this
[SPEAKER_01]: stand here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I bought it and Suzanne has one,
uh, neither of us particularly like to use
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm missing a part on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed just now that actually
comes out of fork that holds the light
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this, this lever here
that allows you to raise it up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, we both much, much more prefer to
just to use it in our hand, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than using the stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do decide to get something like
this, I would hold off on buying the stand
[SPEAKER_01]: until, uh, you know, for sure it's
something you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today we were looking a little bit at
some soil, trying to find, see if I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could find any mites in some soil I had
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pulled a bunch of leaves out of the
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we found some caterpillars,
stink bug, two spotted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surf and fly, which I posted a video of
and, uh, anything else about this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, the dino light before we move
on to other microscopes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the one thing about this is it comes
in like a plastic little sleeve in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always put it back in its plastic sleeve
and bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this one's yours and you do not have
the plastic insert in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just keep it clean in there
because you don't want to get you up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm captain anal.
[SPEAKER_00]: About keeping my lenses clean because
when, you know, when you're taking macro
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, a tiny little spec becomes a huge
spec on your screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a very important to keep all
your equipment clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always keep it in the little slip on
sleeve and then keep it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I fly with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that I'm back traveling again
every week and I just, I have them in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backpack and it travels with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never broken a dino light with all
the flying and throwing an overhead bin
[SPEAKER_00]: and every thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have a dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think microscope here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's back at Suzanne's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll add a video to that here on
the end, possibly when she gets back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to show you guys,
uh, just the more traditional compound
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, uh, my microscopes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a phase contrast microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's made by Meiji.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out of Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I use for looking at,
uh, compost tea or soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Samples in a lot of cases, um,
not great for looking at insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this design, but my Meiji dissecting
scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Meiji too, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great for looking at anything
bigger than an aphid, anything smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost have to slide them out and use
a compound microscope like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a phase contrast microscope,
um, which allows you to see things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are similar to fraction and water,
which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about something like
compost tea, cause we're, it's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: in a liquid, liquid water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you don't need this necessarily
though, if we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, someone who wanted just a
hobby grower who wants to look at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, look at microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne, you mentioned one from Celestron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Celestron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Celestron that you really liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put a link to that model up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she said, you said it was around
$350.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great option for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about quality of
microscopes, the things to consider,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, first and foremost is the quality of
the objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's these things down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, these are the lenses essentially that
are, that are magnifying what you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see through the image here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you're going to take your
objective and multiply it by your
[SPEAKER_01]: eyepiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tells you your total
magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most eyepieces are 10X.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get things like a Barlow lens
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to give you a smaller field
of view, but like this will multiply it
[SPEAKER_01]: another three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I rarely use this in here,
but it can slide into the eyepiece too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, having a trinocular microscope is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not buy a microscope unless it was
triocular anymore today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, if it didn't have this,
it would just be a binocular or they have
[SPEAKER_01]: a monocular one lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some microscopes have built-in cameras
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: This setup that I have here was pretty
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably about six or $7,000 at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, this little adapter here
allows me to hook up a Canon, a digital
[SPEAKER_01]: camera so I could do photos and video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, that comes down to the
quality of the, of the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some of them are built-in cameras
and I've seen the quality really vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and oftentimes, well, built-in
cameras, you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your camera over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never get a built-in one because
photography is, is greatly improving
[SPEAKER_00]: fastly, you know, going mirrorless now and
a lot of the DSLRs, um, on that also,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was researching microscope cameras,
um, you kind of have to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want really good video quality,
which has a lower frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A higher frame rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more seamless, but you do that and
you give up quality on the still pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want better still pictures,
you're going to get jerky videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I really struggled to find a good
camera that does both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of make a decision on your
camera on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some other things, this isn't so
much on how to use a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some of the other parts that come with
a microscope to consider, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's different filters, filter lenses
that may make it easier or harder to see
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep this blue one on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it makes it easier for me to see
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I think one thing I hadn't
talked about was the, the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: the wattage of the light or intensity of
the light is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a 30 watt light versus a lot
of them are 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, it pushes that more like,
cause as you go to a higher, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnification, you need more light at the
same time, being able like to dim the
[SPEAKER_01]: light, which is the switch right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm looking at a compost tea sample
and I want to keep things from drying out
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to look at it longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dim the light to the lowest
level, but that still allows me to see my
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in this case here, I just,
you know, since you're talking about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: slide cover slip, I cheat and do two
person slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a bad thing,
but it saves me a little time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also, you know, you're gonna need
cover slips, um, pipettes are handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the, uh, immersion oil,
which allows you to use the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in this case, it's a, a hundred X,
which, which translates to a thousand X by
[SPEAKER_01]: the time you look through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for me, like you mentioned earlier,
you spend most of your time at 10 X with
[SPEAKER_01]: the jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend most of my time at, uh,
20 X and um, what's this other way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 10 X.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a hundred and 200 times magnification
is where I spend 90% of my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only when I want to really look at
like some bacteria or something really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really close that I ever even go up to 400
times magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you certainly, I never even use the
hundred X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've never needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you, what do you have to say
about microchips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, when I was researching,
cause I had my media dissecting a scope
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I wanted to get, um, uh,
a similar setup to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went and talked to a lot of the
microscope companies because I don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: this setup nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my dissecting a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that came back over and
over again is eye strain and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality glass you have in your
scope is going to have less eye strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for researchers who spend like eight
hours a day to scope, that's why they have
[SPEAKER_00]: these, you know, 50, $60,000 microscopes
because it greatly reduces eye strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, you know, if I'm looking at,
let's say a thrift sample, I may spend 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't as concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I feel I didn't have to be
as in a high price range, but having the
[SPEAKER_00]: moving stage was really important for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I actually spent, I still have
my, um, microscope from when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at that thing and you know,
that you had just two little clips that
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to slide this slide around with
your hands and it was a binocular and my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad actually installed a dimmer switch on
the light so I could adjust my light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I found it the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept it all these years, but,
um, the moving stage really makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: life so much easier to be able to do the
fine adjustments on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's what, with that
Celestron scope, I really liked it had
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmable lights, the adjustable stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go all the way up and do the oil
immersion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes as a triocular, um, which you
can, it comes just with a cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop it off and then you can attach
whether you want to do, you can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Microsoft cameras that almost look
like Dynalight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tube that just drops in DSLR,
um, or you're going to use one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of the, the digicams, um,
that you can get adapters, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: right that the adapter tubes, since they
often have to be custom made, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: run three to $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every time I had to get a new
camera because, you know, if I had more
[SPEAKER_00]: megapixels, one had a better camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another three to $500 investment
every time you upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does, um, get expensive and the
quality of the metal is important and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to knock any microscope
companies, Amscope, but I bought just a
[SPEAKER_00]: stand from Amscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the third time I'm using it,
I went to twist one of the piece of metals
[SPEAKER_00]: and it snapped right in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from what I call Chineseium and
it's like, that plastic metal hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it is and there's
like no fixing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when you have to drill it
out and try to fix it for me, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have some very jewelry rigged,
um, equipment at home for doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the macro insect photography
work I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other thing that's really,
really important is to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope covered and keep it cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get your microscope
serviced, um, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good to do like every 10 years,
they clean it, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's about $300 to get your microscope
serviced.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's due.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a lot of things that I
shouldn't be seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I don't have here that
I left over my actual microscope stand is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Kim wipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are wonderful because they allow
you to clean surfaces without damaging the
[SPEAKER_01]: lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause you have to have special cleaner
for that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess the one big takeaway I want
from people that think about is that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no perfect microscope for any
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, because my interest was
soil-based microbes and for looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: like bacteria, fungal hyphae, looking at
compost teas, this was a setup that made
[SPEAKER_01]: the most sense for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I was more into insects like
Suzanne, then a dissecting microscope
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a more useful tool beyond,
you know, what you can see with dino
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, with the dissecting scopes
too, you can get more magnification by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy extra magnification that
screws on underneath so you can get higher
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically where these microscopes
have the ocular is all built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rotate, you just unscrew them and
add them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, um, improve your magnification
and you know, you can easily see spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and things like that with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the dissecting scope,
you can put like a branch, you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, you can put three dimensional
objects with this, you have to slide mount
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of compound microscopes at
facilities, but people are trying to wedge
[SPEAKER_00]: a leaf under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to look at leads and
things like that, you really need the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do because the light's coming from
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that light's not getting through,
it's going to be pitch black looking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you brought up one thing I have
cheated before when I needed to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: scope and I didn't have like a dino light
at the time, you can't take a flashlight
[SPEAKER_01]: or even your phone light and shine light
from above to allow you to get enough
[SPEAKER_01]: light to see what's on, what's on the
slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a leaf or something,
like I was trying to see a broad light at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and I didn't have any other
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this allowed me to, it was really
hard and a pain in the butt, but just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little like tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing I will say is if
you're spending a sizable amount of money
[SPEAKER_01]: on a microscope, talk to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me, they let me borrow this
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I had a time period where I could
try it out and see if it worked for my use
[SPEAKER_01]: because I wanted to make sure,
you know, that was a chunk of money I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be spending.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in my case, this is a lifetime
investment that I'm going to use for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know, um, the quality of it and
what it actually looks like when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at what I'm going to be looking at
in this case, you know, compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, am I going to be able to see
everything I want to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's absolutely an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are sales reps out there that will
bring one out and let you use it prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I want to share that tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was fortunate because I go to the
Entomological Society of America
[SPEAKER_00]: conference each year and they have the
microscope vendors there and I went around
[SPEAKER_00]: and talked to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because when I was going to buy a
compound scope, I was expecting to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: several thousand dollars and this
restaurant guy is like, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like it, you know,
you can always, you know, return it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I've been, I've had it now,
I think two years and um, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't spend hours a day at it,
but for what it is, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, having an adjustable eyepiece too is
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because you need to be able to adjust
these until it's almost like looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: those old 3d things where you stare at an
image and now it's like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those popular photos where the image would
pop out if you let your eyes like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not everyone could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I kind of equate to like
these pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost have to relax your eyes and
then get them to fit perfectly in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a really good image.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having this be adjustable is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to buy a microscope,
get the triocular and stop holding your
[SPEAKER_00]: camera right here and trying to get those
janky pictures through your cell phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and get a camera that mounts on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get better images because it's
really hard to identify those half out of
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in focus, holding my cell phone over
the holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the dino light solves all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be taking insect photos with
this anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want to look at the fungal
hyphae and you want to look at bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you wouldn't be sending to Suzanne
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then you would use this type of
microscope, but you can save money,
[SPEAKER_01]: $200 for a dino light and then get a high
quality image where you're not using
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phone that allows you to actually catch an
insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good enough to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so do you want to do a quick summary
here before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must have tools in the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10X hand lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I show up at your facility and you do
not have a 10X hand lens, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a very disappointing look for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 10X hand lens, um, some board or some
way to, to identify and identify insects
[SPEAKER_01]: and knock them off of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to collect them with vials,
vials, bags, alcohol, some type of marking
[SPEAKER_00]: tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to flag plants, I think it's
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, the dino light,
you can hook up and use while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have challenges with that actually at
the facility sometime with having the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone, having bright light, trying to flat
surface because you can't really use a
[SPEAKER_00]: dino light like with loose plant leaves,

[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're better at collecting your
leaf samples and taking them back to your
[SPEAKER_00]: little setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rarely would I ever recommend anyone
buy an actual microscope like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or even a dissecting scope,
unless it's something that you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about or really interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think most facilities need to have
a microscope for what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just want to, I think there's,
there's other things you could spend money
[SPEAKER_01]: on within the IPM world or the scouting
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a dino light that would be much more
useful than something like this.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Okay.
