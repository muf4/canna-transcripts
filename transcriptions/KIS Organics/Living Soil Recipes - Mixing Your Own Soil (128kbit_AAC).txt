[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, so I probably spend an
inordinate amount of time thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and potting soils and soilless
recipes and things like that and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in a conversation thread with
some really smart individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Diver, Steve Solomon and some other
folks talking about some recipes because
[SPEAKER_00]: one gentleman reached out wanting to try a
recipe that he saw online and it just it
[SPEAKER_00]: made me think a little bit more about this
and I wanted to share some considerations
[SPEAKER_00]: that people should have when creating
their own soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, I believe that soil
should be formulated around your compost
[SPEAKER_00]: because most people, you know,
whether it's coop mix or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes, it just says, you know,
peat moss or coco coir, pumice or some
[SPEAKER_00]: form of aeration and then compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your compost is a huge factor in
determining your overall fertility and it
[SPEAKER_00]: can change dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be high in nitrates, the C to N
ratio, could be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be very high in potassium or
phosphorus or potentially even a trace
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be high in chlorides or salts and
that could be an issue too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quality of your compost is
important but not only just the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: but the balance of those minerals will
affect what you want to add to it because
[SPEAKER_00]: if I take a compost that's already high in
let's say potassium and then I add a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch more potassium to it, I'm going to
be creating some nutrient imbalances,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially some antagonisms and my plants
aren't going to be as healthy as I may
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, now when I go to
formulate a soil, it'll take me a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two before I'm really comfortable
releasing a recipe internally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of one of our own soil
mixes because I want to mix that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to test the soil multiple times and
then once I feel good about the test
[SPEAKER_00]: results, I want to run plant trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this before I would ever release
a mix to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably overkill, you know,
and if you're a home grower and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to mix your own recipe, you don't
need to go to that extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a soil test is really the only
actionable information that we data that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can collect to allow us to make
improvements on our soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do it optimally,
then plan on budgeting the $60 for a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete test at least once so you can at
least say, okay, oh, wow, this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly have the nitrates that I thought I
did or ammonium is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to let this cycle for a while
before I plant into it or I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all considerations and in some cases we
find you may even need to flush because
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have added too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these online recipes that I'm
seeing, wow, one of them, Steve Diver
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated out the pounds of amendments
that they were recommending in four cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of soil and it was it was almost 54
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is way too much fertilizer or
amendments for essentially 30 gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have created a nutrient pack and I
created this years ago as sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: similar kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, what if, you know, shipping
soil is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if someone wants like the nutrient
mineral portion of what we put in our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So ours weighs about 14 pounds,
four cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to have one here with me,
so I'll just show it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this is our nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's about 14 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's just my best guess at what
you would need if you were using a low
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility soil mix initially, like let's
say like happy frog or pro mix would be
[SPEAKER_00]: good starting points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're mixing your own using high
quality compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know what that compost
fraction is that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your results can vary widely,
you know, very widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Q would always say, like no one's
actually growing a coots mix, but him,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't have his vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really important point
when we're thinking about mixing our own
[SPEAKER_00]: soils is, you know, that compost fraction
is the most important, the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction from a biological perspective,
but also from a nutrient perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to either be bringing
in or not bringing in quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility that you'll want to account for
with the amendments that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to discourage anyone from
mixing your own soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware that you may have a lot more
variability than you realize in your final
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best advice I was ever given,
and I'm going to pass on is less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, always undershoot your targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always add more nutrients during
the cycle, but it's really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with issues if you have toxicities or
too much of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then test your EC, test your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to give you some more
actionable data to decide, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added enough fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not know what that fertility is,
but I know that I've got approximately how
[SPEAKER_00]: much I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my pH is within the range that I'm
aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all good tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just to show you guys,
I just finished trellising this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned this off because I didn't want a
bunch of noise in the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am setting up here some under canopy
airflow that I'm pretty excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hope everyone has a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking out the video.
