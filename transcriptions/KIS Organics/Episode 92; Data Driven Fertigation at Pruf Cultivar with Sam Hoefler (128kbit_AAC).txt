[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, I had the pleasure of chatting
with Samuel Hofler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam is a 10-year cannabis industry
professional and current head grower of
[SPEAKER_02]: Proof Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam is finishing an agronomy degree at
Oregon State University and focuses
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily on nutrient management,
irrigation techniques, and cannabis crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam has created a novel cultivation model
at Proof Cultivar while building one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most advanced and informative data
sets on cannabis nutrient values to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam's long-term goals include establishing
optimal nutrient ranges for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: creating an open platform for industry
professionals to share knowledge,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to continue pursuing a lifelong
passion for researching cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm excited to get a chance to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got to come down and visit your
facility a few months ago now and see you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys in production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's go ahead and give listeners a
little background into who you are and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you do over at Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Sam Hofler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently head grower at Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proof Cultivar in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a pretty large indoor organic
cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my background with cannabis is a
little over 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Pennsylvania and was
introduced to cannabis pretty early on and
[SPEAKER_00]: started to grow it almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've kind of bounced around the
country and operating a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different facilities from working with
Penn State and tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses there to Southern Oregon and
large 50-acre cannabis and hemp operations
[SPEAKER_00]: and mushroom cultivation down in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bounced around and ended up at Proof
a little over a year and a half ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working ever since to try to
revolutionize and overhaul the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: model that was going on there and have
since landed on a new program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it due to Kiss Organic Soil,
which we're super happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, now in Portland, Oregon and
having a blast and operating one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest facilities I've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this facility is quite
technologically advanced in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet you guys are also facing some
other challenges because of the way the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility was originally laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get into this later,
but since you mentioned the technological
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect, let's just you want to kind of
describe some of those things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have at Proof and how they've been either
useful or not as useful as you would have
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were originally installed years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proof kind of started out with this really
grand ideal of being able to take cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation to the next level of
scientific production and technological
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a lot of automation early
on back in the day from custom built
[SPEAKER_00]: robots that lift trays up and down and
move them along transfer line systems to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto pot washers and auto dirt fillers,
auto planters kind of the whole purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: was to be able to stage plants,
get them in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the automation kind of takes care
of the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the ambition, I think most
cannabis growers that have grown for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years know that it's really hard
to automate a human touch when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation and being able to
produce really great craft quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis automated just isn't something
that's always worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've slowly and quite painfully
over the year, kind of ripped out all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the initial automation and gone back to
just hands on labor and hands on process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point in the grow,
everything is done by hand, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from propagation to about half of our
watering to transplanting and pruning and
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, harvesting, weighing,
packaging, trimming, everything is done by
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not a lot of automation
that goes on at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the little bit of technology that
we do utilize now is more for data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection and trying to control
everything around the plants rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work really hard to use some custom
operating systems and software for our
[SPEAKER_00]: climate control to deliver accurate
climates and set points to the rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and then to collect some really
high end data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding irrigation and try to bring some
of these new crop theory principles and
[SPEAKER_00]: merge them into an organic methodology and
make them work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this really interesting blend of
starting out at high technology and then
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of working our way backwards to
really where the basics are at and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to utilize some of the basic agronomic
technology that's been around for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like tensiometers is super
important in the program that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just automated irrigation as much as
possible through trip lines and climate
[SPEAKER_00]: control and being able to track those
trends has been really impactful versus
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I haven't found to be worth
the money are the auto fillers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto pots, things that try to automate
the labor aspect of it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult to eliminate that
from your program I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're one of the few facilities
I've seen that's kind of gone the other
[SPEAKER_02]: way where you started like highly
technologically advanced and actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: moved the other direction as you guys have
tried to pursue better craft cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that I would possibly
highlight is a lot of the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: used horticulturally as technological
tools don't necessarily translate as well
[SPEAKER_02]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like some of the plants,
and you can correct me on this if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, cannabis seems to be a little bit
more sensitive in terms of how it's
[SPEAKER_02]: handled versus some of these other
ornamental crops that we're mass producing
[SPEAKER_02]: in these greenhouses and industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your experiences with it?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more difficult to uniformly
take technology and just apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With ornamentals and these mass produced
crops in greenhouses, there's kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: one size fits all method to technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come in and you just create a uniform
environment across the entire space and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to do all of your processes
without really having to change much
[SPEAKER_00]: versus cannabis is very, every plant is
unique and alive and growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: individual and the way you shape it and
form it and work with it over its life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle really impacts the product on the
end and it's actively changing in its
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the climate change from
propagation to veg to flower to mid,
[SPEAKER_00]: late and early flowers, just it's really
different all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot that you can take from
maybe these mass produced industries that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been around for much longer and try
to adopt that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, it makes it a bit of a
challenge because these days most large
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, whether it be ornamentals or
other mass produced farms, they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to focus on the money side of it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to be as economical as
possible and it's really hard to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: and apply it to an organic setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run into this issue with trying to
adopt volumetric water content
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and things of that nature to
kind of a container grown, soilless media
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't always work out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of adoption and
adaption that has to happen whenever you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to take something from another
industry and apply it to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and let's be clear, your yields are
still quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you guys are the top producer in
Oregon and I think is what Jeremy was
[SPEAKER_02]: telling me, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an up and down roller coaster
for 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the largest indoor producer by
volume, like how much we produce for the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets a little difficult late season
when all these outdoor farms start coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and mass producing crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took a long while, maybe a little
bit of history about the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't start out organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out as a mineral, two part
fertilizer, you know, 52 gallon pots on a
[SPEAKER_00]: single tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jeremy brought in a wonderful
cultivation design, Jeremy Plumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: for those wondering, and created a really
awesome organic program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took about two years to just to
reach this point where it was extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in and record breaking and hitting
just massive number output from our rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of diving into another
topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went through some pretty massive
changes in 2021 that were forced upon us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is inevitably how we ended up in this
new program to to really have to work our
[SPEAKER_00]: way backwards and try to reach those
numbers again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been extremely difficult,
but really happy with where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields are are doing really well and happy
to kind of walk through that transition
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had to go through if you want to
dive down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to come back and talk to you
about what technological tools you found
[SPEAKER_02]: most useful in your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to shelve that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember Jeremy reached out to me
towards the end of last year, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: panicked, like we need soil right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fortunately able to get you guys
what you needed at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, and I'm not going to name
any names here, but you had been working
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bottled nutrient line and
apparently they changed their formulation
[SPEAKER_02]: during covid without telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I understand that created very high
levels of chlorides.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the in the soil or in your in your
solution and that you want to talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about what effects that had on
the plants for people who aren't familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with chloride toxicities or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really interesting situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, we have been using the same
program for about two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using basically an inert media
that was cocoa and pea based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were using bottled nutrients
and at the same time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: peak demand was just through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the really big producers in
Canada had a bog fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pea supply was just massively low and
they're scraping the bottom of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product we were getting in was
just like cake flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just nothing to it that was
allowing good growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put it in order and they basically
canceled it and said, sorry, we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: supply you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only had eight weeks of supply
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil media kind of being the foundation
of the program, it was really really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to take them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we have to build something new within
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really scary endeavor,
which I think is, you know, when we gave
[SPEAKER_00]: you a call and we started to really pursue
all those options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, at the same time, I had been
tracking for about six months before this
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just necrotic tissue starting to
form, yellowing leaves that just died
[SPEAKER_00]: back, just rapid burning, browning of the
leaves that get super crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I'm taking tests and I'm
doing soil tests and sap analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was seeing PPM levels of chloride up
in the six, seven, eight thousand PPMs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants were just dying back
massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was terrifying to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tested everything from our nutrients
to our supply lines, our recipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: our soil, every single cultivar,
our plants, sap, soil solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste, our M3 tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down a rabbit hole of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even tested the piping between our
rooms to see what is being scraped away
[SPEAKER_00]: from potentially metallic pipes and stuff
and circle back around and conclusively
[SPEAKER_00]: prove that the issue was with this
fertilizer that we were buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I reached out and they just flat out
denied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six to nine months later, come back
around spring of twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of faced with this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeremy and I ended up meeting with
some of the executives of that company and
[SPEAKER_00]: showed them like, hey, this is a really
big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they confided to us that they did,
in fact, change their recipe and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really think it was going to affect
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it had a massive effect
on our output and the value of the company
[SPEAKER_00]: and and how everything was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up in this position of of
having to completely change our program
[SPEAKER_00]: from soil to nutrient and fertilizer and
do all of it in about two months time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were coming off our biggest year
ever, just a record breaking year from
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty twenty and having, you know,
incredible output, really happy with where
[SPEAKER_00]: we were positioned in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now suddenly our whole program just
like crumbled in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we kind of took a step back,
Jeremy and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a I remember one day we were
sitting in the office and we had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great conversation about what is the
future of proof and where do we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take this brand and and what are our core
values?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we agreed upon that we wanted to stay
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this day and age, I think Jeremy
and I both agree that organic is never
[SPEAKER_00]: really enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to move in a more sustainable
model, a more advanced method.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many brands that just tack
organic onto their their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't really mean much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's ecologically what's
best for the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we we definitely decided upon early
on that we wanted to go with living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked to a number of different
people and we called you and had great
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really happy with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the biggest issues that
came up is, you know, the first challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: was container sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our facility was designed for two gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the program that we had been running
for three years was three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're forced with this issue of
living soil, which we're being told should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be grown in 20, 30, 30 gallon
pots or beds, ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a really difficult
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we just kind of had to trust our
ability to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're curious about that
container pot issue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've we settled in 10 gallon pots
with a really interesting method of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of using traditional fertilizers still
through drip injection and how they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of match the depletion of the soil with
what we're putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a very fascinating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can you want to talk about that or if
you want me to go back and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think we can go right into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just add that normally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so let me give a little more context
here just from and correct me if I get
[SPEAKER_02]: this wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the one of Jeremy Plum's big goals
with proof it was to create consistent,
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent chemo type expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were a medical patient walking
into a store and you wanted to and you
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say you had really good results from
this particular cultivar that proof
[SPEAKER_02]: produced, you know, Jeremy would be able
to confidently say that he is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the exact same result every batch
after batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that tends to push you away from
living soils and towards, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a bottled nutrient or program where you
can control every aspect of the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with living soils, we're giving up
a little bit of that control and counting
[SPEAKER_02]: on the microbes in nature to sort of
handle that for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's a little context as to
why proof was growing the way they were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And normally, too, you know, Jeremy and I
talked about this and Sam, you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about how, you know, this wasn't
the ideal way to make a switch over into
[SPEAKER_02]: another production system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally you'd run trials, you know,
you run one room and see how it performed
[SPEAKER_02]: and collect all that data and then look to
improve it and make sure the workflows
[SPEAKER_02]: make sense and SOPs for your current
staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you weren't able to do all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of had to make the make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did we jumped right off the deep
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even really have time to do many
trials or really any trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of we initially tried to sneak a
couple into some production crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: a tray here, a tray there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just like, yeah, this isn't
really working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, we have one crop
left of our old soil of our old program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make a decision now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jeremy, his vision with proof was
always have a very consistent product for
[SPEAKER_00]: the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still really important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say we're still able to hit
that even in the new program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been one of probably the most
difficult things to really target is just
[SPEAKER_00]: to balance those minerals and that
nutrition for the plants so that the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're getting is really,
really accurate with with what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it is and just the consistency
there every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it was a big leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: But happily, we've we've worked through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went from an old inner three
gallon pot, highly liquid injected inline
[SPEAKER_00]: injection drip system where there's a lot
of organic liquid feed to using a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we ran the first crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We threw the plants in and we're like,
OK, you know, a 10 gallon pot as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to do water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's probably not going to last on
nutrients for the size of our plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at what point does it start to
deplete?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at what point do we have to kind of
lift it and pick it up with these
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really big question for us
that we just didn't have the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of crossed our fingers
through a whole crop into the pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately the plants love the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they just started out looking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started taking data and collecting
tissue and soil samples and just recording
[SPEAKER_00]: this all and plotting it all and crafts
and and really keeping an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about that same time frame,
we reached out and we're talking to Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason, soil doctor, and had really great
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of triangulating between you,
Jeremy and I and him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of just established that let's
get away from the bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of go go way back to just the
basis of fertilizers from organic products
[SPEAKER_00]: and just and using powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single one of these bottled
products come from these raw sources
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just skip the whole liquid
injection and shipping this massive weight
[SPEAKER_00]: around the country, this massive freight,
you know, shipping carbon footprint around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country and just go back to the basis
and use this fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and now we use pretty much
everything attached to the sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gypsum, epsom salt, just really
basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we switched to this new
program with the living soil, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing 10 gallon pots and it's working
phenomenally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that's really
unique and rare for an indoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in an organic setting,
to use a 10 gallon pot in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With minimal fertilizer inputs and have it
work as well as it's working for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really started by just observing where
our depletion was at on specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: on specific time frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my program, I track and trace every
single analyte, you know, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and nitrogen or potassium,
phosphorus, manganese, iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I track every single element in every
cultivar in every room, basically every
[SPEAKER_00]: single week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I plot those on a graph and I
have rolling averages that I track and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace in a dashboard to see how we trend
on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I've grabbed what
sufficiency ranges exist out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and I've kind of adapted them to
cannabis and then set some of our own to
[SPEAKER_00]: really establish where we want to be at
for those ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hardest part was,
you know, how much do we put in to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: either step these nutrients up or step
them down based on the trends of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs in its specific life cycle
phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as the plant goes through
flower, you know, it may start to need
[SPEAKER_00]: less and less nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may want to use more mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may uptake more mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we not only balance what we're
putting in and our concentrations and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much is going into the soil, but how do we
balance what's being depleted out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kits already?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a pretty big challenge for me
and a massive learning curve as I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: worked through those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're about nine months into the
program now and about 5% lower on yields
[SPEAKER_00]: than we were on the old one after three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extremely happy with where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product quality is just three to roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our THC scores have gone up from 19% to
27% on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new genetics that we're working
with, just really happy with the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is entirely novel and new,
in my opinion, what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot at work that we've kind of just
grabbed from so many other methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and made it work in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of getting back to the technology
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really easy to focus on
technology when you're doing hydro and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're doing cocoa, you know,
mineral fertilizers going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a number of companies out
there these days that are just focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: volumetric water content and crop steering
as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just watching your EC and your drive
back and doing all these really accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started looking into
that, you know, I was like, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does this even work in organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I found, the principles of
it do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sensors and the data that you need
to actually drive and make those decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So piggybacking off of kind of some of the
initial stuff that Brian introduced to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went way back to just original around
tensiometers and we use those to really
[SPEAKER_00]: match our attention to our drive backs
rather than volumetric water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with our soil, we have to pay
attention to our matrix potential and
[SPEAKER_00]: really play a, you know, keep an eye on
that data and play a pivotal role in when
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to trigger certain developments in
the crop cycle, when we want to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: them to flower, when we want them to bulk,
when we want them to finish and the
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation, the morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control a lot of these things based
off of our attention alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, how much water we have
to put in in order to hit those specific
[SPEAKER_00]: drive backs with tension rather than
volumetric water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of had this original
automated facility that we switched to a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil that's all handcrafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using, you know, outdoor,
quote unquote, technologies like
[SPEAKER_00]: tensiometers indoor with small containers,
10 gallons and using classic powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers with a batch tank mixing
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this very crazy model that we've
been able to build and work and not only
[SPEAKER_00]: just get to work, but hit record breaking
yields again, hit record breaking THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, just greatly improve our quality
from a program that was so well defined
[SPEAKER_00]: before and do it all within about six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Sam, take me back a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about using a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're measuring the moisture tension
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're utilizing that data as a
way of intentionally stressing the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: at certain stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of explain that a little bit
more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of tension is matrix
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the soil particles are
essentially holding onto their water and
[SPEAKER_00]: roots want that water and they have to
overcome a certain level of tension in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to take that water away from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a tensiometer essentially measures
how hard those roots are having to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to take that water away from the
soil particles and uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really, you know,
very nondescriptive method of what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening from a scientific
standpoint, but essentially that's what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic principles of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about stress,
there's been this idea in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation for a very long time that,
you know, there's good stress and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously nobody wants bad stress on
their plants, but there is ways to use
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on a plant to influence how you
want that plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these principles have been
adopted from crop steering and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them we've just kind of had to create on
our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as using the tensiometers,
I think what's really important for us is
[SPEAKER_00]: to limit that stress and have almost no
stress in vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during flower, there's a few
different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kind of tend to go two different
paths when it comes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to stress early in flower
at the flip to kind of initiate budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go back to low stress during
bulk to really put the weight onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they stress again, late flower to
finish out the maturation period and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to really finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I kind of adhere to,
that methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's other people that kind of
do the opposite and they want low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: when you flip to flower and then stress
mid flower and then no stress late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of the inverse of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've found to be true is that if
we can hit a specific tension before we
[SPEAKER_00]: water every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, vegetatively in our soil,
and this is going to change depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what soil you're at and kind of how you
want to grow your plants and at what rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let my veg plants get above 10
kPa and then not any higher than 15 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sweet spot right around 12 is
where I want my vegetative moms water
[SPEAKER_00]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it gives them enough dry back that
oxygen is getting into those pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting around those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping that plant to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you water again and you're
replacing that oxygen with more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wait too long, you're stressing
that plant because it's starting to think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not going to have enough water
to continue growing at the rate it's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and starts to limit its own
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus if you water it too early,
not enough oxygen is replacing the water
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pores and you're not getting enough
aeration in your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to time it at this perfect
interval has been really important for me
[SPEAKER_00]: in how we drive plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for vegetative, we try to hit
between 10 and 15 kPa, and that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: really big for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for flower, we kind of do the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principle behind that is that when you
flip the flower, you want that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: have just a little bit of stress,
just a tiny bit of stress so that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: knows that now I'm not supposed to be
growing at max potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supposed to be putting energy into bud
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a little bit of stress right when
we flip the flower by letting that dry
[SPEAKER_00]: back or that tension increase a little bit
higher, maybe to 20, 25 before we water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that stretch period of an
early flower and they're done stretching
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bud sites are already there,
it's not going to be flipping back to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that plant to start bulking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around week two and week three,
we start going back to kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative irrigation where we're letting
that tension stay pretty low in that 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're letting that plant get just
enough dry back that the roots get oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's happy with that dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're hitting it with water
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing that every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trick is to give it just enough
water to get you through to that point so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the next time you need to water the
following day, you're at the proper amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will change based on climate
factors, how big your pots or soil types,
[SPEAKER_00]: how vigorous your plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything kind of goes into this,
but we found it really impactful to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hit these specific times when we're
watering, do multiple irrigations a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit very specific tension measurements
from those tensiometers and hit it
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately and consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have inconsistent watering,
you're going to have inconsistent flower
[SPEAKER_00]: as just a very loose correlation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tensiometers have been really impactful
for us in how we shape the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to limit stretch and limit
growth, you can increase tension between
[SPEAKER_00]: waterings to limit how much they're able
to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have that water available to
the plant, they're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: put a ton of energy into growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be focused on reserving
that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you give them low stress,
low tension, and you give them just
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate amounts of oxygen replacement in
between those waterings and that plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason to stop growing, you're going to
see incredible growth from your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: both veg and even early flower or bulking
if you really want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other factors like lighting
that come into it when you want to design
[SPEAKER_00]: the height of your plant and how you
really control that from a light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and your intranodal density in
the overall stretch of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, tension has been really
important for us in soil-less mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start looking at hydro,
it's something that you just, nobody uses
[SPEAKER_00]: tensiometers really in rockwool or even
cocoa that much because the matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: potential just, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you really have to
worry about too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for listeners to save you the time
from looking things up, if you're familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with millibar ratings, the kilopascal is
just a tenth of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a 10 kPa would be 100 millibar,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, you and I haven't
talked about this previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a little bit new to me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the people that we work with
like Justin, for example, runs much lower
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, so much wetter soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll run in that 60 to 80 range or six to
eight kPa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you're letting things get a lot
drier and in general running things a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one component of that we have
to look at too is also your environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: controls, how you're running temperature
and humidity in the room and what your VPD
[SPEAKER_02]: is as a relationship to all of these other
numbers in terms of how fast your plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This morning, I was down at the Willamette
Research Center talking with Dr. Knackley
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the conversations we love
having when we're talking about hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: just like in a research trial,
you try to control everything you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want one variable that we can
focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's never just one variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to designing a program,
there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to try to control
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of try to control as much
as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the numbers I throw out are not
going to be directly able to be taken and
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to another system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the trials I've done over
the past two months is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a soil that's high organic media,
you can't exactly send it off to a lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: get your water depletion curve calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not just sand silt and clay
making up your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to have that depletion
curve, one of the things I did was just to
[SPEAKER_00]: physically map it with data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a tensiometer that's digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just takes measurements every 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took two volumetric water
content probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put them at very specific levels
within the pot, three inches from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and then five inches from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that two inch ceramic tip on the
tensiometer at that same range,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of it is at that three inch and
the top of it is at that five inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I charted our own water depletion
curves on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did this with, you know,
KISS soil straight out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this with KISS soil that's been used
for two months after a plant we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, had called and it's just
completely compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so root bound and there's just
like no pores left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting to be able to,
you know, read something in a textbook
[SPEAKER_00]: about how pore size changes, you know,
your water holding capacity and field
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity and your tension and things like
this, and then go physically measure it
[SPEAKER_00]: with sensors and to have that data
correlate exactly to what you're reading
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely, you know, for Justin,
I don't know him personally and I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been up there yet, but I know that they
reuse their KISS, they amend it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time, that media is going to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your porosity is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pore size is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect them to be running
different numbers because even in our
[SPEAKER_00]: system, just the difference of two months
in a pot changes kind of those target set
[SPEAKER_00]: points, so to speak, of tension that we're
trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The available water, your volumetric water
content at a specific tension is way
[SPEAKER_00]: higher in the KISS when it's fresh because
of the large aggregates, the porosity is
[SPEAKER_00]: really sloppy than it is when it's more
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we start getting into that
stuff, that's more root bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower pore space, more root density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes really hard to accurately water
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this great presentation I gave
to my watering team about this to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: drill it into their heads is, you know,
when you have this fresh soil and a low
[SPEAKER_00]: root density plant, the water,
the soil can hold so much water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can also hold oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your window for irrigation,
you know, maybe 12 hours, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you accidentally miss and you wait
eight hours, you water that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably not feeling a ton of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, I measured about a 30%
volumetric water content difference before
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a 3 kPa difference in that soil
when the KISS is fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can go from 45 VWC down to 25 VWC
and it'll only move from about 6 kPa to 9
[SPEAKER_00]: kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have a ton of water there,
like it's a really slow curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start looking at things
that are highly compacted, low pore space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really high root density,
that soil is starting to break down and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just not a ton of water holding
capacity after it's been used for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may drop 5%, you know, from 30 down to
25 volumetric water content, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a 10 to 15 kPa difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, it's really about just
trying to see how much stress your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are having to utilize to get the water
they need, and then what their water
[SPEAKER_00]: reserves are and how long they have before
it runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that, you know, the biggest factor
I tried to drill into the heads of the
[SPEAKER_00]: watering team is that when you have an old
compacted plant, like a mom that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for two or three months,
you know, you may start to water it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting to see these overwatering
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily because you're
giving it too much water, it's because the
[SPEAKER_00]: water holding capacity is so low that the
only time it has enough water to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the tension high enough so that the
plant can take it in is at the same level
[SPEAKER_00]: when all the oxygen is displaced from the
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this change that happens to a
point where you can no longer give enough
[SPEAKER_00]: water to the plant without completely
displacing oxygen from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes really difficult to water
plants after a specific point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So container size is not only important
for available nutrients, but how dense
[SPEAKER_00]: your roots are gonna get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say we're right on that threshold
with our flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after eight weeks of being in
that 10 gallon pot, they're pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't quite say roots, root bound,
but root dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't really go back past that,
you know, eight to nine week maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle without running into some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thankfully we, you know, we phenol
hunt and we select cultivars and we kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of build our program to be designed
around, you know, an eight week to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half to maybe nine week maturation
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you brought up a lot of good points
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for folks that wanna start
playing around with this in their
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, I think this is definitely
something that people should be looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of figuring out based on the
media that they're using what works in
[SPEAKER_02]: their rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, watering cannot be
understated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I see over and over
again as the biggest variable in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times the deficiencies that I
see people are dealing with is a lot of it
[SPEAKER_02]: relates back to improper watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dialing in your watering is just
critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that you brought up
that is a similarity across both of your
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and we'll get you up to
Justin's here sooner or later to check it
[SPEAKER_02]: out, but you know, consistent watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're using blue mats,
so they're getting water all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this idea of increased water
frequency, like what you mentioned is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's very consistent across
both facilities and then staying within a
[SPEAKER_02]: given range, you know, whatever that
defined range of watering is so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not getting those big wet and dry
cycles that you might be more likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: see in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, like you said, irrigation,
it can't be understated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually just a couple of days ago,
cause I didn't mention this in the bio,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do go to Oregon State for agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking in one of my classes
with faculty and the question came up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like what is the most important
climatic factor in crop reduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really difficult question,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's just so much that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have your, your temperature
and your light and, you know, pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and available nutrients and all these
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, you know, I settled on,
I was like, well, it's water, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's to me, water is always going to
be the most important factor when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to crop production and cannabis test those
limits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's just so much else that
goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water to me is always kind of the
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with your media, you start with
your nutrients, you start with your water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then everything else kind of comes,
comes behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you work on your climate,
your temperature, your RH, and then at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very end, you kind of focus on light
intensity is like the last lever to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that Jeremy has
helped to instill into me is every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go pull a lever for light
intensity, we, we have to circle around
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that, you know, everything
else is going good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't run, you know, we,
we have LEDs that we put in this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost entirely LED in our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the really big efforts we
undertook this past year, but we don't run
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, as high as the hydro guys
or other facilities, we keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively lower than I would say most
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of that is just because
we, we don't see a need for luxury
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of light in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's just so many factors,
but irrigation just, it can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: understated and, and super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I want to make sure I covered
all those technology topics you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: circle around upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think tensiometers is probably the most
important thing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were wondering, I know I've
talked to you in the past, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: why we don't use EC sensors or media
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it is we just, we don't,
we, I've, I've calculated what goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the media well enough that I don't really
worry about how it's sitting in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: staying over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit backwards to how
some people work with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in cocoa or, or hydro, and you're
actually getting leachate, but in our new
[SPEAKER_00]: program, we don't have any runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what we put in water and mineral
life, it stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have anything that comes out the
bottom of the pot, which has been a really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome thing to happen when we think
about, you know, wastewater and waste
[SPEAKER_00]: streams and, you know, pollution that
happens from really big cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities using liquid waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid injection fertilizers and whether
it's organic or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we really try to give them
just enough so that they're hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of what they need without crazy
luxury consumption of these nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the perfect amount of water so that it
evenly saturates and has the right amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really tough balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tough balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, uh, real quickly, what PPFD levels
that canopy are you guys currently using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we had, so we're between 900 and a
thousand you most typically, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not, there's a lot of people with
the new LEDs that want to push higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen stuff as high as 1700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot of people average in that 12
to 1400 range is, is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we run our lights pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we get up to that range of
that 900 to 1000 pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it, it kind of stays there on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not running any higher, um,
you moles in our LEDs than we are with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the couple of rooms that we
still have on HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're relatively the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we get is dimming control,
um, better, significantly better
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, um, and just better spectrum
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, do you think you, you will start
to turn the dial on lighting and
[SPEAKER_02]: uplighting intensity or do you feel low?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, like you mentioned,
not offering luxury levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's the level sort of
where you guys are comfortable in your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility in terms of your yields and
output and pushing the plant any harder
[SPEAKER_02]: won't necessarily, uh, offer enough
benefit to offset the amount of wattage or
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical consumption that you'd be
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I think if there's
potential for increased yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there's always that drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To want to push for it and something
that's been ingrained through,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, my education with agronomy is that
just because it's higher yield doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's always worth, but worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, sometimes your inputs just
creep up higher than that extra little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of yield will get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's, there's definitely
room to go higher, but I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: room to go higher at specific intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher light intensity at specific
times to control morphology, to control
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch, to increase no density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I would say on average,
I don't really see us going above 1100 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1150, you know, even when we're doing
peak, um, yeah, like peak absolute best
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is just facility design,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons people run higher
light intensities is because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing trays like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have like an even canopy through the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get side lighting on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, you know, we have one really
even canopy across the entire room versus
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the people running hydro or rock
wall or things, you know, greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing like benches, like,
uh, rows, table rows, where they only have
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant on each row going, you know,
maybe a hundred plants long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their light intensity has to be
good enough, not only to hit the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, but also down the sides of the
plants and try to get those lower buds at
[SPEAKER_00]: all as well versus our cultivation model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much strip everything back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we go very heavy on our prune
and then we just get a really big,
[SPEAKER_00]: even canopy all the way across the top,
which is one of those ways that we also
[SPEAKER_00]: control consistency at proof is just to
try to avoid the vertical growth as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible from, you know, top to bottom
and just having an even canopy that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of on one level all the way throughout the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask a little bit about like what
your printing schedule is or philosophies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, I'll try to give as much info as I
can without divulging too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so we, we do two prunes and we do them
pretty early on in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to do one pretty much at the flip
and then a couple of weeks into flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is kind of just to get
rid of some of those lower growth top of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, kind of shape them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, we don't do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one we cut out,
and this is really specific for facility
[SPEAKER_00]: design, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would not recommend our printing
style to someone that's growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel or greenhouse or doing hydro that,
you know, has side lighting and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're, they're going to want to
leave all these lower branches on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we strip a ton back kind of in the
second to third week of flower and leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much only the top 20 to 25% of the
buds on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not less and just really create
an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want just great airflow through
that bottom of the canopy and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of being pulled up through the,
through the canopy as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, yeah, I think that's
probably as much as I can really dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: it without giving an actual class on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And describing pruning is a tough thing to
do on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well let's, let's change topics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get over cause, um, when I came
to the facility, one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys were doing was this, uh,
tank mixing and application of various
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, I mean, you guys are doing
more testing than any other facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know when I first saw all your
tests, I was like, do we need this many
[SPEAKER_02]: tests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and, and, you know,
we kind of went back and forth on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think it'd be, you know,
you're so collecting data for the sake of
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting data is pointless, but
collecting data that then you can use to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow you to make good decisions is
priceless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I think,
um, Jeremy's told me about you is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're very good at taking that data and
then using it and, um, creating a program
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's where I think would be
interesting for listeners is sort of one,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what, you know, you, you touched on
briefly some of the tests that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking, but then how are you taking all of
these tests and then creating a program
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows you to target these different,
you know, trace trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause one thing, you know, just as
background, like for me, and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that Bryant and I have
philosophically, like it's a minor
[SPEAKER_02]: difference on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, um, Bryant's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I tend to focus more just on the
macros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as long as I feel like the micro,
the, the, the micro or trace minerals are
[SPEAKER_02]: there, then I feel like we're,
we're probably good unless they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so my ranges, they're a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I tend to not fiddle with it,
but you guys, you and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and from working with Bryant, you guys are
really targeting those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, just talk to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, uh, first just kind of give it
a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give you a little
context around this is going to be super
[SPEAKER_00]: important because I don't want to,
I don't want to give advice for people and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they take it and run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely agree for your situation
when you're building soil that is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline for so many different types grows
and people and situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to focus on kind of like
these wide ranges, getting enough of those
[SPEAKER_00]: macros and then micros are pretty easy to
supplement on like the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, scale, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my situation, absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably do more testing than anyone
else or any other facility I've come
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've put a lot of faith and
time, money, and effort into testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it kind of just evolved naturally
when we're, when we were building this
[SPEAKER_00]: program, I, there was a lot of feedback
internally and externally from people that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the old method of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say old method of growing for
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you just kind of observe the
plan to keep an eye out for quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptoms showing up in the
leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of just like
self-diagnose and then add more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's never been my preferred
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very much a numbers guy and I want to
quantify everything and I want it to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: within this certain bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we were building, um,
the program from scratch, we always knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were going to start out with just
a ton of testing and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly back off of that over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here we are, you know,
six to nine months, nine months is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably from when we ran like the first
crop and we had no idea how it was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn out versus six months from when we
probably ran the first crop with a actual
[SPEAKER_00]: new fertilizer program that we were like
running for the first time to see how it
[SPEAKER_00]: went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so a little ways out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I only test a couple of times a
month and I still probably test every room
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe two cultivars from every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I still probably send out 30
to 45 tests a month that includes both
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and soil versus before I was
sending out 30 a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a large difference there and
that will continue to dwindle over time to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where we may only send out at
key intervals in the maturation period,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're, you're absolutely the right
data for the sake of data is really fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not very practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in a production environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started taking the data,
I did not have the knowledge I knew now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was relying heavily on Brian and the
lab and another consultant at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, and like, how do I even
take this and interpret it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a situation that a lot
of cultivators and farmers really end up
[SPEAKER_00]: in and my education around agronomy and
just working with this day in and day out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really helps you kind of evolve my
understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started taking these tests,
you know, I got the first test and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I have some very rough
sufficiency ranges that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: published from various universities around
the world on hemp at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the week before flower that I'm going to
try to correlate to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you take that and correlate it
to vetch and the, you know, the pre flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and then early flower, mid flower,
late flower, you know, how do I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: track this over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those trends, I just kind of had to
learn and graph over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first get the first data set,
you know, I'm like, well, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this point in time that this is
where my plants are at and now I can take
[SPEAKER_00]: this and I can make changes up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning of a nutrient
program, you can kind of make pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're just like bottomed out
on nitrogen, right, you can up your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen or know if your calcium is at
like 1%, it's pretty easy to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: change and add more calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as your program goes on,
it's harder to make changes almost because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to move them really minute
ways, you know, really, really small ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of nutrient interaction
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first test comes in, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, great point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second test comes in,
you know, I only have two papers side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side, but then I get the third and the
fourth and the fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm in my month into this,
you know, I've got like 100 data sample
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, like all spread out around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I have no idea how to take
this information and like, try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of it and watch the trends of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I developed a tracking model,
kind of just out of necessity where I take
[SPEAKER_00]: all that data and I put it into a sample
form in Excel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do these really basic graphs,
you know, to kind of track stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was tracking information like
strains and data samples and plant health,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where all those values of the
analytes are at and then using graphs to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of track that on a day of maturation
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even still, that was good,
but it got convoluted when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting up into having, you know,
six to 10,000 different data points in a
[SPEAKER_00]: single data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like for my soil, I think I have
like 10,000 data points at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for tissue, probably a little bit more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after time, you know, I ended up having
a hundred different tiny little graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: that only attract individual cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to a point where there's a
couple of different things you need from
[SPEAKER_00]: your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know what an individual crop
in an individual cultivar in an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: room is doing when you have multiple
rooms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take that one room and try to
apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need both the macro and the
micro picture of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so recently about right before
Christmas vacation, I've filled out this
[SPEAKER_00]: new dashboard, which I don't think I've
had a chance to show you, but you'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes all of those data points and all
those data sets and has them in singular
[SPEAKER_00]: tables and then queries them into this
dashboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see and observe any specific
data points that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the specific analyte I want on a
single dashboard over an average week of
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation for any specific cultivar,
any specific crop, any specific room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can visually just see how those
analytes move over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see where we start with calcium
at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I know that's a combination
of what's already in the kids versus what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see that trend line rise and
fall from week zero to week one,
[SPEAKER_00]: to week two, to week three, and have a
trend line that actually maps that average
[SPEAKER_00]: across that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time on that graph,
I can, I have the sufficiency ranges that
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, there's not great
publication data on sufficiency range for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some out there that is the best
that we have, but I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusive at all yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I took those and I ran with them and
I've kind of moved them based on what I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought is best and what I've observed
from a plant health and recorded from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have this dashboard that,
like, you said, it has to be practical,
[SPEAKER_00]: that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I study that data daily and weekly now
to the point where every single time I add
[SPEAKER_00]: a new data set, it's this self-learning
data model that just continues to evolve
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see how we went from having a ton of
our nutrients, you know, deficient or
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic or out of whack during week five,
initially with the program to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say pretty much all except maybe
one or two elements are just exactly where
[SPEAKER_00]: we want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are dialed in and I even had
a call last week with client where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just, I call them up and we're like,
well, you know, at this point it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, maybe you adjust something
here, maybe you adjust something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been really fascinating the
past six months to just dive into this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient program, take all this data,
you know, convert it to something useful,
[SPEAKER_00]: go apply it back to the plant and then see
positive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a massive learning experience
and undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say, you know, my goal is that by
the end of January here, that the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: program is finished and stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is basically automated to the point
where I can go and focus on other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can start focusing on dialing and on
pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can dial in our lighting, I can dial in
our VPD and all these other variables,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you have on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the past year, nutrients have been
the, you know, the biggest limiting factor
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully we're pretty much over that
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back to hitting record breaking
yields and we'll just, we'll keep moving
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like, there's no great training
manual on how to build a facility specific
[SPEAKER_00]: data set and how to take these,
you know, everyone recommends,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, go get a soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, get a tissue sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: But short of having a full-time
consultant, how do you take that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, as a cultivator, you know,
whether you're home or a large commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And collect that data and correlate that
to yield, correlate that to plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: and to influence your decisions and have
proof of why you're doing this throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: those changes and guide your program along
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I think is easily
understood in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I want to highlight that you
mentioned is this idea of waiting until
[SPEAKER_02]: you see a deficiency in your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at that point, really it's too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already stressed your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I'll be the first to admit I need
to learn a lot more about tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't something that was traditionally
available to cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's something that I need to
educate myself on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're able to, you're able to work with,
with that data and a lab to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, what sorts of trends did
you find with our soil for people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: listening and maybe use our soil in terms
of things to watch for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being in containers that you found that
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I don't, we, we kind of touched
on it, but the whole premise behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: container thing is like living soil will
work in any container, but obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger you go, the less additional
fertilizer you have to put in because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bigger reserve, there's a bigger
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you do a 30 gallon or 40
gallon or whatever size you go up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you can do a water only program.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, and not really have to
put anything in, but for a 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: container, it wasn't a question of if we
would, or we wouldn't run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more a question of when we would
and what ones we would do running out at
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you mentioned, you know,
as a, as a soil builder, your focus is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of on those macros and most of the
micros are kind of just there naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: from some of the inputs that you utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But micros is important, really important
in media that buffers high pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that was really
beneficial is we brought a close associate
[SPEAKER_00]: in not too long ago because we were seeing
like manganese uptake, like really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were using just like a tiny bit of
manganese, but not anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would, you know, bat an eye at,
and I was really confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, and like, I pulled all the
manganese out of the program and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, I'm just, I just won't put it
in anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were still getting this,
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, I'm just like
scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turns out that it's it's one of those
things where you wouldn't be able to just
[SPEAKER_00]: like look at a leaf and know what is going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant is showing manganese
toxicity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And manganese toxicity is this very
interesting, like camouflage, purplish,
[SPEAKER_00]: reddish brown, like very, very unique
coloration that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of this distorting whirling of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening is that with the soil
kind of buffering around a 7.0 pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.8 to like a 7.1, it's pretty high,
but a good range in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But iron oxidizes at that point,
it precipitates out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it essentially becomes rust in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not readily available to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever that plant runs out of iron
availability, it starts taking up that
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese in replacement of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just getting a huge flush of
manganese into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like running into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the ways I changed that is
we just we added iron to our weekly feed
[SPEAKER_00]: program before I was adding microbes at
the beginning of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hoping that they would just like
there would be a reserve of them to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of last throughout that whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But iron was just precipitating out
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And manganese was becoming hyper available
and just getting taken into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I push iron weekly two times a week
and just low concentrations like in the 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 15 ppm range in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just it keeps it available to the
plant at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see any iron issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manganese issue has gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, specifically with your
soil, I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can take a plant, put it into it
and it's immediately happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some small optimization
you can do from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great amount of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people are trying to take
your soil and then throw calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably probably not the right path
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But calcium is great in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It buffers kind of on the higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things that do have limited
availability at high pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a peek at those and kind of see
how your plant is holding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really don't have to supplement a
ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those first three, four weeks of
flower, we do input some stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's mostly a luxury feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's putting it into the soil so that
by the time what's available and the kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: runs out around week four, the stuff we've
been putting in for the past few weeks is
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming available and it's starting to be
taken into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this kind of handoff from what
is in the kiss to what we're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to happen about halfway through
flower and it's such a pivotal point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But iron, iron is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other micros, I don't have to worry
about too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't really put much of
anything in other than iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium is something that when you have
super high calcium in the soil and we also
[SPEAKER_00]: add, you know, sulfate and potash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're adding in potassium as well that
mag can kind of become a little
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen really great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just pushing either magnesium
poliers and veg or just by adding a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of mag into that feeding program and
kind of boosting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about this until on air
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to show you the dashboard and some
of the data I've been collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I mean, like for someone that
wants the soil that they can use a large
[SPEAKER_00]: pot or a large container or even a bed or
something like that and just put a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and it does 95% of the work for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just organic all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our facility is in this really unique
position where we're just restricted by
[SPEAKER_00]: container size and we kind of have to pick
up a little of the work halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great to work with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The iron thing is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The magnesium thing is not unexpected to
me because of the high calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see where magnesium could be
potentially optimized by adding a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be careful with magnesium
because it will raise your pH if you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the ways that people are adding
it because it is a cation too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an interesting, all the dynamics
and the way these minerals work together
[SPEAKER_02]: with biology and the physical properties
of the soil to optimize plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope people will start looking at
this and utilizing testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you brought up that
I think is important is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people get stuck because they're like,
okay, well, I can go get a soil test,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then what the heck do I do with this
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do I have to pay someone else to
look at it and give me results?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a lot of people
doing that with varying abilities and
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I are both, you know, friends with
and fans of Bryant Mason over at Hill
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor Consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does have a course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get him back on the podcast,
but he does have a course where he teaches
[SPEAKER_02]: you how to evaluate a soil test that you
can sign up for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's actually a coupon
code.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put in the Kiss Organics,
you can save a hundred bucks or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 bucks off the test, off the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I completely stand behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, both Jeremy and I have gone
through that course and looked at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a ton of conversations with
Bryant and, you know, for anyone that is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of in that position of like,
okay, you know, I do get a soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely utilize his course and also
utilize his, you know, consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been immensely helpful in just kind
of building a foundation for us and then
[SPEAKER_00]: circling back around and just kind of
giving, it's really difficult to like
[SPEAKER_00]: build a program almost by myself and then
be like, okay, you know, I should probably
[SPEAKER_00]: get a second opinion on this and talk to
someone else and verify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single time we talk,
it's just, like really confirming for the
[SPEAKER_00]: work we're doing and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can't say enough about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an awesome person and highly
recommended to anyone listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get a test through Logan Labs,
send it off to Bryant and he'll give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: result.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great option for people who
don't have the time or energy to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, want to learn all of it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want this to turn into a,
you know, shameless plug for Kiss,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you are using our soil,
we will customize a nutrient pack for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: For free, if you send us a Logan test of
your soil and if it's our soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: we offer that as a service.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not doing outside testing just
due to I don't have the time to do it and
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryant's already doing a better job than I
could at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't need to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting back to this testing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do want to ask you, you mentioned
you're adding iron, you mentioned you're
[SPEAKER_02]: adding magnesium, you mentioned doing a
lot of these in sulfate form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about how you,
you know, what products or I guess not
[SPEAKER_02]: products, but like what amendments are you
using to raise these particular nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's been, it's been really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just kind of taken like a,
I don't know, a 30 year step back because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously when you go to any other farm
production, right, I mean, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go to outdoor ag or, you know,
any kind of vegetable or produce or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, people amend their fertilizers
with, you know, raw products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They amend their fields and stuff with raw
products versus cannabis has this very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting hierarchy of nutrients where
it's like, you know, cannabis nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's over a hundred different brands of
cannabis nutrients and they all pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much come from the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they all use the same raw
ingredients, the same base ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that I definitely
adopted from Brian and completely agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with is like, just stop paying to ship
water and to have someone else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, build this nutrient for you when
you have so much more control using those
[SPEAKER_00]: raw products yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much everything I use other than
two products is going to be attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, you know, just, just base
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much everything other than
nitrogen and phosphorus is coming from a
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, calcium, we're using
Chipsum, calcium sulfate, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using Epsom salt, iron sulfate,
sulfate of potash, manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is basically sulfate attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only, you know, raw powder that we're
not would be like sodium borate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we, I have no need to add boron pretty
much at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always at a good level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also don't like putting sodium into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I never really used that every,
the main ones I use, we honestly don't put
[SPEAKER_00]: it much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the nitrogen we use is like the
Ferticell Explorer, the powdered base soy
[SPEAKER_00]: protein powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also use like Crow or Secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use Chipsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a little bit of Mag for like
foliars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use sulfate of potash and yeah,
some, some C-phosphor phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty much it in iron,
iron sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I mean, I,
I think I only use four of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, you know, I have every single one
on hand in case for some reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: something pops up on the specific crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only thing we use actively is
Chipsum, Epsom salt, PFOS, Ferticell
[SPEAKER_00]: Explorer and iron sulfate and potassium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I have the, like you said,
you mentioned that we use the batch tank
[SPEAKER_00]: system now, which has been a big change
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we used to do inline injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a batch tank that we mix
everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for simplicity, we only mix one
recipe a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this schedule built out so that,
you know, Mondays and Thursdays,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have one recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesdays and Fridays, we have one recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesdays and Sundays, we have another
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Saturdays is when we introduce
like biologicals, like microorganisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff into the, into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to use three recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is just kind of your,
your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And iron, another one is your calcium and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one's mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just get that at varying amounts,
whether they're in veg, pre-flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: early, mid or late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of manipulate the volumes
going into the soil and track where that
[SPEAKER_00]: data is on the soil test and in the
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can kind of, I don't even have to
change the concentrations of the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just change how much volume of the feed
is going into the pot on an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: crop or a whole facility-wide basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it really easy to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to think if there's
anything else we could share for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a facility that's listening that
wanted to try and embark on this path of
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting more data and then using it to
make some of these actionable decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any advice you would have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it is pretty daunting to think
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're kind of through the worst
of it, but yeah, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, that's, that's a great
question because I, you know, for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've learned over this past
year, I don't have 20 years experience
[SPEAKER_00]: working with these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's been a lot really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anyone listening, I would say
start like, first off, just don't guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you see a deficiency on a leaf,
you don't, don't just guess and apply
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing has a really important place in
agricultural and production and just
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize the experts around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that be Bryant, whether that be
your local university, obviously here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, I go to Oregon state,
Oregon state has no affiliation with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but they are able to work with
hemp and there's a lot of universities
[SPEAKER_00]: around the country that are able to work
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of that data, you know,
correlates to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having questions about
nutrients, just utilize the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, you can do testing through
Logan Labs, but they also offer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, recommendations based on their
own test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant has really great advice and he has
his own course built around nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not entirely for cannabis, but you can use
everything in it for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, there's just a massive amount
of resources there, but they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're often hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the nutrient industry in cannabis
is so overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the nutrient companies are going
to tell you like, oh yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just go, just go pay, you know,
10% of the cost of our nutrients by buying
[SPEAKER_00]: the raw product and being able to control
calcium individually, rather than having
[SPEAKER_00]: put in, you know, five nutrients at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, that's not mainstream in the
cannabis industry these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to read between the lines,
utilize local universities, utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: university research, utilize crop
consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize labs, utilize people like you that
are building an awesome product and kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you a strong foundation and
then know how to organize your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, data for data sake is never
really good in a production model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that data and have a way to track
it and trace it and to correlate it to
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking with, you know, Suzanne,
Wayne Wright Evans, the amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correlate these mineral
concentrations to pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correlate it to, you know,
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you can correlate it to plant
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correlate it to how much you
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correlate it to all these
different factors, but you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that data organized digitally in a table
and a spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to use it and to
manipulate it at your will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just save it on paper and put it
in a folder and put it in a box and stash
[SPEAKER_00]: it away and try to remember it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to take the 20 minutes
to just transfer it to a digital file,
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog it, organize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to use it to track your program
overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I guess it got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things I was going to say
is be sure to take some pictures of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, too, so you can have a visual
representation of what this test actually
[SPEAKER_02]: correlates with visually so you can go
back and look at your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you are working with an
agronomist, make sure they're familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with soilless media, because a lot of the
people are growing in essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: peat-based or cocoa-based soils,
which is very, very, very different than
[SPEAKER_02]: actual sand-silt and clay soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of agronomists aren't comfortable
and a lot of the tests don't correlate
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Brian did a great Instagram post the
other day talking about how we can't look
[SPEAKER_02]: at cation exchange capacity the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That number isn't really relevant on a
malic-3 test, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing I was going to
say on this is when it comes to tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, you mentioned that there were
some sufficiency ranges that were already
[SPEAKER_02]: published.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that I'd be able to
share on the podcast page when we put out
[SPEAKER_02]: the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's some great ones out of
North Carolina State, North Carolina
[SPEAKER_00]: University, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I can share those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good foundations, but I
wouldn't say to entirely rely on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian also has some really great ranges
from his experience that I believe are in
[SPEAKER_00]: his program that are often utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the university ones out there,
just remember that they can't touch
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are doing testing that is
either not tracked in the maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, meaning that it could be done in
veg, it could be done in flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be done pre-flour, it could be
done at any of these times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also testing a wide variety of
hemp genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I remember reading
in one of those publications is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: max sufficiency range for one cultivar was
below the minimum sufficiency range of
[SPEAKER_00]: another one for, I think it was either
nitrogen or calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a really wide range that's
genetic specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll try to get those over to you
and see if I can kind of give you some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those base values to go off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's definitely something you
have to kind of figure out for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and take up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just double your calcium because
some university growing hemp says that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the proper amount to grow calcium at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your plants best when they look
healthy, you know when they're yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if things are yielding well and the
data is just slightly off, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to change something if you're getting good
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so all the more reason to collect
data for your own facility and your own
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, when you do have a good
bumper crop, your best yields,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure to take a test so you know what
your targets are for that cultivar and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you did in that room so that you have
essentially created your targets in a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good way to approach it from
the other range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always about a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it can be about an optimal
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the biggest things I hear
from crop consultants all across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people come running in terror
whenever something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their facility and we they talk to us
once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them a couple of suggestions and
you know their plants start to look
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy again and like, OK, yeah,
I got this now and they just like they
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear again and then they come back
four months later, panicking when things
[SPEAKER_00]: start going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's really important to take note
when you're doing things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not more important than when things are
going wrong, because obviously you're
[SPEAKER_00]: never trying to mimic when something is
going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to always have that target set
point for when things are going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so great advice there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just one thing to end on for
people is at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not the goal of all of this is not
the perfect test or the perfect tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's really about yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't don't drive yourself crazy if
your plants look good and your test is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's better not to tinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to leave that as a thought
for people in the back of their heads,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because yeah, I mean, they're
sampling errors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's a variety of reasons that
test result might not line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, your plants,
your plant health is what we want to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, well, this, you know,
like Jeremy, I could talk to you for hours
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But was there anything anything parting
you wanted to add regarding anything we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we pretty much covered a good a
good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could end up talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever and ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's probably enough information
there for people to digest and really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you having me on and having the
chance to talk and kind of share some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to kind of show you some
of the new data and dashboards and info we
[SPEAKER_00]: got going on down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to seeing where you
guys are, you know, save in a year from
[SPEAKER_02]: now, because I know you're always you guys
are always moving forward and improving
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Sam Hoefler and you were
listening to the Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post pertinent links on the podcast
page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just click on the Learn tab and then
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you next time.
