[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and drawing top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is my dear friend,
Jeremy Plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy was the Director of Production
Science at Proof Cultivar, one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: technologically advanced cannabis
cultivation facilities in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Proof, Jeremy combined decades of
cannabis horticultural experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting edge technology to deliver
previously unattainable consistency in
[SPEAKER_00]: both product quality and consumer effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to his leadership at Proof,
Jeremy was the co-founder of Pharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: recently acclaimed by Rolling Stone as one
of Oregon's top dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy has served as a cannabis consultant
to Israel medical cannabis researchers and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cannabis policy advisor for US
members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also serves on the OLCC's Rulemaking
Advisory Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, Jeremy co-founded Cultivation
Classic, Oregon's leading craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in Portland, Oregon with his
border collie, Lucy, and when he can,
[SPEAKER_00]: finds fewer greater joy than sailing on
the mighty Columbia River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Jeremy, thanks for coming on the show
again today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Tad, great to be on the show again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are coming to us all the way from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took time out of your busy schedule
and a work vacation a little bit too to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to us today about aroma, I think was
the topic you wanted to tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that I'm speaking to you from
Dublin, I feel it's appropriate to start
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation with a quote from one of
my favorite writers and poets,
[SPEAKER_01]: William Butler Yates, who is also from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote these lines a long time ago,
but I think this is really relevant to our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, the world is full of magic
things, patiently awaiting for our senses
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow sharper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That little quote is almost, I think,
a bit of a mission statement for the
[SPEAKER_01]: direction that I'm excited to talk about,
which connects to some of the recent
[SPEAKER_01]: science I've been doing both from the
cultivation and the consumer education
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, trying to create a bridge
between sensory science done in a mature
[SPEAKER_01]: way to the cannabis cultivation efforts
and to the rich analytical chemistry that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have access to, because I think I'll be
able to share means by which it's even
[SPEAKER_01]: more relevant in a lot of ways than,
say, a focus narrowly on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tad, I want to start with,
I actually have an exciting announcement,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been forthcoming for some time,
and there's been some delays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a scientific white paper that
is a journal article that is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out in the journal Molecules that I
have the privilege of collaborating with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Adi Ray and Jeremy Sackett,
previous founder of Cascadia Analytical,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Adi's grad students who've been
helping to digest a lot of the data from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cultivation Classic event.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I co-founded like eight years ago,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the exciting thing is that when we set
out to start Cultivation Classic,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I actually was in Washington,
DC on a cannabis lobbying trip with
[SPEAKER_01]: Congressman Blumenauer, trying to think
about how we could support Oregon to have
[SPEAKER_01]: its own voice, which is a lot about
ecology and ethics, as well as about
[SPEAKER_01]: community and education and trying to
empower all the producers to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the cutting edge of both production
dynamics and product character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to open source all the
trade secrets that were going on as a
[SPEAKER_01]: longtime cultivator myself and empower the
community to do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in many ways we've achieved some
of that aim, but this is really a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: way that has always been something we've
been excited about but just haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: the resource to follow through on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've created a ton of data because I
think as you know, Cultivation Classic is
[SPEAKER_01]: really distinct from any other cannabis
evaluation competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really in love with our colleagues who
put on a variety of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis events and bring the community
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will never forget my very first High
Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is I also quickly became
aware of the fact that in all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions you would see these scenes
where there's a handful of really amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: judges usually who are deeply involved and
they're kind of dumped on with a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of samples and they have a very
short period of time and there's almost no
[SPEAKER_01]: controls about how they're exploring those
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then various competitors are given
these awards which end up having massive
[SPEAKER_01]: impact in their business and their brand
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, I think that we see
that inherently those awards aren't tied
[SPEAKER_01]: to the sort of quality evaluation you
would hope to see if you were looking from
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would really like to see that all of
the samples were very thoroughly and
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorously reviewed in a process that
could create truly differentiated sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean is sometimes the best
products don't win full stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not always the case of course,
but in any case Cultivation Classic was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a response to that and I am really
proud of the fact that we've had double
[SPEAKER_01]: blind sort of very scientifically rigorous
evaluation at the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes agronomic or agricultural
grading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes sensory grading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also included the very first versions
of an ecological energy efficiency tool
[SPEAKER_01]: called the PowerScore that Derek Smith's
organization, the Resource Innovation
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute brought forward to our event
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually the Oregon producers who
would fill out really long forms like 14
[SPEAKER_01]: pages talking about energy and water
empowered the RII to be more effective
[SPEAKER_01]: nationwide in having baseline data for
indoor, outdoor and greenhouse production
[SPEAKER_01]: models.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also had some other weird stuff
like the most important I would say thrust
[SPEAKER_01]: in the organization has been led by A.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: in that she as a neuroscientist and the
DEA and NIDA licensed cannabis researcher
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to work on the qualitative
patient perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't speak in patient terms though,
because that would run afoul of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk about consumers and instead of
being able to talk about therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, we really talk about consumer
enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's working within the limitations of
our fractured non-federal regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way that we could do this truly
clinical level research with trained
[SPEAKER_01]: judges who work for up to six months in
some cases and have a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time and purview of the samples and
detailed process and input tools to
[SPEAKER_01]: summarize their findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the exciting things is also
simply being able to avoid all the inter
[SPEAKER_01]: lab variability to choose a single
analytical testing partner to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify all of those products with a
similar baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's exciting is the findings that
we're putting forward in the journal
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules is really the very first bit of
the data that's been harnessed at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation Classic, which has been an
entirely volunteer run program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I initially found that with Steph
Barnhart, previously of the Lament Week,
[SPEAKER_01]: now co-founder of Smart Cannabis,
which became the backend data effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for anybody who saw behind the
scenes and was just used to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions being pretty rigged,
I had hoped that they were kind of blown
[SPEAKER_01]: away by the level of rigor and blinding to
the evaluations that went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee there's not a close second
currently, although I hope there are more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of work to map,
I think the organ chemoscape, by having
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of craft producers funneling through
that same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think this first work that's coming
out is some of the most exciting and
[SPEAKER_01]: disruptive because we find ourselves in a
time where I think a lot about the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers we serve as cultivators and the
experience that they have when they go
[SPEAKER_01]: into a retail dispensary to acquire the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is if you come from the old
school and you had the privilege of being
[SPEAKER_01]: very close to a cultivator who was really
skilled, you would frequently be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: observe quality and character in the
product samples that were vastly better
[SPEAKER_01]: than what you typically see in wholesale
cannabis and retail cannabis in the adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is often simply because of freshness,
is my perspective, and I'll say more about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the importance of aroma cannot be
overstated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump to the punch line and share
a couple of the findings that have
[SPEAKER_01]: actually come up before, but I think now
are a little sharper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out of this research, which to the
best of my knowledge is the biggest scale
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trial level quality study using
contemporary products, not like 2% moldy
[SPEAKER_01]: NIDA weed, but really exceptional craft
cannabis produced by organic cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: in Oregon to then look at what attributes
are most enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do the people, which are a very
diverse band of judges in this rigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, what are they enjoying the most
about the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple question in a way,
but when we think back to the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, consumer walks into retail,
they see things that are high THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking in terms of Indica sativa
hybrid, they're now using terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance and correlating that to personal
and targeted effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worse, there's marketing efforts that use
proprietary modalities to categorize
[SPEAKER_01]: things into targeted effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you peel the veneer, you find there's
absolutely zero evidence to support that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of marketing language.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the marketers understand that there's
a great importance for the consumers to
[SPEAKER_01]: parse this incredibly diverse landscape of
products into effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people do want sleep aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be stimulated and focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be relaxed and calmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be aroused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be creative, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that this fundamentally is
deceit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just call it what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an earnest effort to meet consumer
demand, but it's early stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no tools or scientific evidence
to support that this flower will cause
[SPEAKER_01]: that outcome and the other will cause a
different outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly, I want to insert a little micro
thesis here, which is my notion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you determine what kind of an
effect a product is going to have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's engendered that tone by virtue of
genetics, your genetics, as well as your
[SPEAKER_01]: diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things that factor in,
but those are giant forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually talked with cannabis
clinicians who feel so passionately about
[SPEAKER_01]: the diet component.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to work with
endocannabinoids until the diet component
[SPEAKER_01]: is better understood, until people work on
eating in a more healthful way because the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits will be so greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, the endocannabinoid system
tone means that your experience is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be different than mine and every other
person in some important way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That exact same product will act
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only one variable in the effect
matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we've got to deal with the
phytochemical inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: What chemicals are in this flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're left with this uncomfortable
reality where we're only measuring a tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction and typically the things that are
the largest molecular weight in a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you do not inherently have the most
bioactive or the best awareness of the
[SPEAKER_01]: full range of secondary metabolism and
what those compounds can do for people
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just so far from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few examples are that gas and fuel
smells we now widely understand are driven
[SPEAKER_01]: by compounds that are detectable to human
olfactory reaction at parts per trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, thiles and thylates,
if you have in a natural gas line,
[SPEAKER_01]: then now you can smell the otherwise inert
explosive gas because it's so tiny of
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of thiles needed to create that
sensory awareness that there's danger,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's natural gas leaking or being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thiles are rich in a very important
category of aromatic chemistry in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, at a parts per trillion level
basis, you can imagine where 25% of a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer perceived aroma could result in
one billionth of the total chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory of that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very important data point that's
certainly not reflected in a turkey
[SPEAKER_01]: report, but there are many other examples
like how esters with all these tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: and sweet sugary and fruity notes or the
aldehydes things like green apple and
[SPEAKER_01]: banana are so prominent or a paper in 2012
that summarized more than 50% of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma being aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these other categorizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is we're measuring a tiny
bit of the phytochemical inventory and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're making too big of a leap about the
representation and significance of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I just look around at other consumer
products, I don't see nearly anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: except for say winemakers being concerned
with that in consumer representation of
[SPEAKER_01]: wine, in brewers in representing that
other than to the ultra beer geeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cicerones in their representation of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, you find pretty commonly sensory
language, but I'll save that for later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third part of the effects matrix is
that you have dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosage is getting increasingly better
measured, but really dosage is the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: variable in determining the intensity of
the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full stop, a little tiny bit more and you
may be outside of the therapeutic window
[SPEAKER_01]: and now result in increased awareness of
pain or anxiety as opposed to a decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable therapeutic outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosage and titration are huge,
but then you have to throw in,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're talking about altered states
of consciousness when we're evaluating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis product qualities, you have to
deal with mindset and setting similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: how the new psilocybin assisted therapy
modalities are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in curating beautiful music
playlists and having amazing environments
[SPEAKER_01]: and blindfolds and headphones and
therapists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really working on that component
in a way that cannabis folks, I just
[SPEAKER_01]: genuinely don't see hardly at all other
than a few circles in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get to a targeted effect,
that's an honest way to educate people,
[SPEAKER_01]: to observe their own experience and take
notes and start to understand how to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The marketing that stands in the way of a
normal consumer walking into a shop and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to attain something that they
either just find enjoyable or even
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially therapeutically useful is a
giant obstacle currently in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important to cultivators
because we're the ones who have to create
[SPEAKER_01]: these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to essentially work within
what is the most genetically diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural crop on the planet with tons
and tons of different production
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in general, those of us who are
working hard at it are trying to delight
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make things that are truly
enjoyable and useful, but if there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement or mark to ascertain what that
enjoyment is correlated to, I think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: left with a lot of people who are working
on a sample size of one, taking their own
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdote and expressing from that
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great if you have, say,
the tremendous privilege of being in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry or since long before it was an
industry and it's just been a movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: finding the entire range of possible
sensory experiences in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another great long word,
phenomenologically qualified samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenology is this idea of you study
your own experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the gist, but that's what I've
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: My career in cannabis, I have always tried
to understand myself as a baseline and not
[SPEAKER_01]: project that that is relevant or valid to
others in many regards, but for my own
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to understand what is the most
desirable cannabis character, how does
[SPEAKER_01]: that language connect to the idea of
product quality and which plants are the
[SPEAKER_01]: most exceptional plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the range in the chemo scaper and
the expressiveness of the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the more and less intense
expressions of each of the core categories
[SPEAKER_01]: in that range?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a kind of filtering that as
cultivators, I think you inherently are
[SPEAKER_01]: left with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then jumping back to the white paper and
then I'll take a breath, there is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: clear emphasis in this standout signal of
what directly correlates with consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very distinct from how you see
cannabis being marketed currently and it
[SPEAKER_01]: is 100% related to aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aroma is different than flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about sensory science,
flavor, say we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, a beer or ale and I understand the
complexity of correlating cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, but I just want to use that
language because it's very practical from
[SPEAKER_01]: a sensory perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor has to do with mouthfeel or salt,
sweet, umami, fat, bitter, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are actually flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we really are talking about the
character of a cannabis flower product
[SPEAKER_01]: especially, we're talking about the aroma
most importantly, by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, THC potency did not positively
correlate with consumer enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven out of 10 judges preferred samples
when blinded and randomized that were
[SPEAKER_01]: under 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really important idea that's at
the base of that, which is there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis in the plant that's creating
and manufacturing all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: classes of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the glucose, the sugars and the
photosynthates are converting at the base
[SPEAKER_01]: of the glandular head, at the tip of the
stock of the trichome, you'll see this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible enzymatic process where the
oligatolic acid and the geranopiroplastate
[SPEAKER_01]: are taking that glucose and turning that
into CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the path by which the biosynthesis
of cannabinoids are created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an interesting piece, and this is a
bit of a complex one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have all the answers thought or
anything, but I am fascinated that GPP,
[SPEAKER_01]: geranopiroplastate, is used for both the
pathway to make cannabinoids as well as to
[SPEAKER_01]: make terpenoids and other aroma
components.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine we're selecting plants for a
wholesale market that is pursuing THC
[SPEAKER_01]: potency and strain names correlated to
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to make the most money or
make any money at all, you better have
[SPEAKER_01]: something well north of 25% THC potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then think back to the biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're making decisions that are
essentially resulting in products that
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivize the cannabinoid potency in a
hierarchy over the aroma synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does not turn out to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at other literature,
the THC potency neatly correlates to
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity of effect either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this fantasy that we're
economizing as consumers by purchasing a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher THC rich product, when in fact,
you find that actually, as you look deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: into the literature, there's numerous
anecdotes about people who find that while
[SPEAKER_01]: they love cannabis and have a lifelong
relationship with it, when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming those products, they're very
high THC, they're both having less
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable experiences, less enjoyment,
and essentially evoking anxiety that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is fantastic at a swaging in some
cases, I love intensity of effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in no way trying to diminish the
pursuit of strong experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I micro dosing is great and all that I am
somebody who loves the whole range of
[SPEAKER_01]: expression and really understand the
consumer desire to feel things deeply and
[SPEAKER_01]: richly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that in our data,
you can see which is, again, I believe to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the most rigorous, at scale clinical
evidence that I'm aware of on the planet
[SPEAKER_01]: so far, and maybe there's others are
always excited to learn more, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a lot more work ourselves, that we see
that it really is the case that the aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: correlates with far more enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enjoyment correlates to both
intensity and diversity of effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the beginning, the tip of the
iceberg in terms of trying to tilt this
[SPEAKER_01]: equation away from, there's actually a
really wonderful woman named Kristen
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoder, who has a t shirt line that says
cannabis, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica and sativa is lazy marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is one of the most important
statements that we have to attack to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into serving people better, but then as
cultivators, being able to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: most amazing cannabis products on the
earth to really focus on the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna matter the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should take a breath, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a long breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I kinda wanna just go back and try
and summarize and make sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, because you covered a lot
of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things that I wanna
possibly highlight are one, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that one, we don't have the right tools to
capture all of the sensory experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: analytically that are occurring in this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about thiols and some of these
other aromatic aspects, and I'm coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from a place with someone who does not
have a very good sense of smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's a really important
tool, and then one of the things that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation Classic found that I just
wanna reemphasize that you've mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times here is that the most
popular or the most coveted cultivars were
[SPEAKER_00]: not the highest potency or highest THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an industry, we've been driving for
more THC, more THC, but the reality of it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a consumer perspective is that when
given blind options, so they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC levels in them, people were
consistently choosing ones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly lower THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I know the alcohol
correlation is challenging in some way or
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison, but for me, I much prefer a
lager or an ale over an IPA, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because I enjoy the flavor profile of it
more so than the heavy hoppy bitterness
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with a lot of IPAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the alcohol percentage is
lower, I'm gonna pay the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: money for the beer, and I'm not going to
get as much alcohol, which is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: driver for a lot of people in consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that richness of experience is
an important conversation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I really wanna
highlight that you mentioned was this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of titration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about this off air,
and you talk about the biggest driver on
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your experience of smoking that joint
or consuming that cannabis bud is really
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, environment,
mood, cultivar, all of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC percentage are all gonna be factors,
but like you've told me multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage is the biggest factor, and people
should be aware of that when consuming,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we address all of these
challenges then to give us a better model
[SPEAKER_00]: for understanding our experience with this
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great summary and great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick caveat I wanna stuff in before
responding to that is that it was a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: revolution to get access to chemistry
analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I was with Ray Bowser at
the time, or Odi Diesel, and there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: circle of us working around Pat Marshall's
lab in Wilsonville, Oregon called Sunrise
[SPEAKER_01]: Analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually the, I believe a lab
operating well in advance of Steep Hill in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, and was the first analytical
testing I'm aware of in the US to try to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were looking at 64 compounds,
and we were really informed by the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that phenotypic plasticity was occurring
in our cultivation efforts, that a single
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar taking cuttings from that
cultivar shared with different gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: would produce very different range of
chemistry, and that's a really important
[SPEAKER_01]: insight, and as growers, I think it's
really exciting to talk about analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry as a metric by which we can
measure performance and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many exciting components there,
and not to throw it out, but what I wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest now is that even when I founded a
dispensary called Pharma on Hawthorne in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland, this was the dispensary that had
the very first terpene categorization
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first dispensary that I'm aware of
that displayed terpene data for all flower
[SPEAKER_01]: products, all tested at one lab was one of
my big notions of how do we get people
[SPEAKER_01]: into utilizing cannabis in a way that's
like lifelong sustainable relationships,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not just serving one population or
another, but being a resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look back at, and I think I did the best
that I could at the time, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendously indebted to Dr. Ethan Russo
and Raphael Moshulam and others who had
[SPEAKER_01]: laid the groundwork to try to understand
from that perspective, but I tell you now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I look back and I think it's not that it
was a mistake, it was a step in the path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think our whole industry has become
overly reliant on very fallible analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The output we see in an analytical lab
result will vary from lab to lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: from crop to crop, in ways that simply are
astounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the level of data I've been
able to digest over the last decade,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share with you that it's just,
it means very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a particular way to demonstrate an
analytical testing process that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer perspective is useful,
but that's not what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty chaotic when we don't have
third party regulatory oversight over lab
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, and when we have, even after the
American herbal pharmacopeia standards,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's huge variance in methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, what I'm trying to say is
what would be far more useful is an
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate sensory expression in describing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to take on beer, because I actually
love beer and have been learning a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: from scientists involved with hops in the
last years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In beer, if you have a lager, that's a
brand promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consumer now has an expectation of
that brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be crisp, refreshing,
moderate ABV, something like 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a crystal clear, cold
fermented product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find more biscuits or certain
notes that are going to stand out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's an expectation now that the
consumer has, and the producer is obliged
[SPEAKER_01]: to fulfill that if it is a lager.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a hazy IPA, however, now we have a
product that we have an expectation that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a viscous liqueur that's thick
mouthfeel with low bitterness,
[SPEAKER_01]: with massive pop aroma and mouthfeel
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as a producer, I can work within that
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that we haven't moved to this
level of maturity in the massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic diversity we have in cannabis into
these archetypal sensory buckets yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine how much more rewarding it
is to people who are purchasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: products when, say, they're looking for
their peak gas expression, and they look
[SPEAKER_01]: and find that there's a range of gassy
products, but in fact, one is much,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more expressive as I saw recently at
a cultivator's curatorial event in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Node Labs and Cultivated Industries was
involved with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one product that was so clearly
the dominant dial rich product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then there's like 10 others.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was so much louder, but I would
say a majority of people wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you look to how cannabis producers
curate their products, I hate to say this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as a grower myself, it's like we rely
on our own sense disproportionately
[SPEAKER_01]: because we haven't studied sensory science
and don't have the tools to make relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: the language of sensory to the consumer in
a way that's very, very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, we literally have one person
saying, this one's the shit, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, take it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, yeah, but when you look
into sensory science, you learn that we
[SPEAKER_01]: all have certain things you can smell and
not smell so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say you can't smell so well,
I a little bit want to challenge that
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think the sense of smell is a
very subjective, interesting terrain to
[SPEAKER_01]: dive into.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an amazing movie for those of you
who want to geek out on smell called Les
[SPEAKER_01]: Parfums that just came out that actually
features this protagonist who's a nose,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's a perfumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the most elite training you can
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sensory on the planet, well beneath
that is wine, well beneath that is beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis isn't even really on the radar
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is, but it's just not showing
up in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a great sort of exploration of
what a nose must be able to achieve to
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially demonstrate effectiveness in
sensory.
[SPEAKER_01]: In sensory, you use typically panels of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 or 30 people would be a pretty ideal
size group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are masters who have really
taken this on with incredible discipline
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world of craft beer that I've been
looking to for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay Barr, I believe is one that I'll
just throw a name out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good friend, Nick Ziegler, who was the
head of R&D at Yakima Chief Hops is
[SPEAKER_01]: another great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew Hull is a man who's composed a
sensory science team for the company True
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people all have real world
experience that are based in
[SPEAKER_01]: characterizing products from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, what I'm trying to say is
that it sure would be useful if as
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators and as an industry,
we leaned way more toward the sensory side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the equation, not to abandon analytics,
both are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, I'm a breeder,
and I'm very privileged to be working on
[SPEAKER_01]: some at scale hemogenetics program this
year, in addition to things that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: still at ProofCultivar, because I'm now a
consultant and have the ability to do more
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting and different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: After having recently found an
unbelievable head grower, who's named Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: Hofler, who I if those of you who have not
listened to the podcast you hosted with
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, he in one paragraph, I think says
some of the most innovative thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation practices I've heard that once
he came on, and the team has gotten really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong, I've been able to focus in areas
that I'm looking forward to developing
[SPEAKER_01]: more, which is more R&D stuff and
engagement with the world and different
[SPEAKER_01]: visions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, in the hemp breeding,
you want to have both sensory and
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics in your funnel so that you can
truly find those most differentiated
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to on the importance of aroma,
I would say that if you do not have aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: as a key target, and you're working in say
a smokable hemp or a craft flower space,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're really missing the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say this, we have an Instagram
culture that looks at frosty flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'll never forget when like
this snow was big or when BC like beesters
[SPEAKER_01]: was coming through, and there was this
huge amount of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had no character at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like this inert biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had also no effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just it looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We continue to see plants bred from the
white, I'm just going to call it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white is a soulless plant to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown so many versions of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown so many hybrids from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you'll see a dominant trait that
increases the trichome production and this
[SPEAKER_01]: visible resin content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not about what's visible,
it's what's inside that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't judge the character of the
finest wine by looking at the bottle or
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the quality of the skin of the
grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the aroma and the magic of all of
this chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I think actually to just
jump for to another level, level of depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is partly a reflection on our
culture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from an industrial culture that
has been focused on throughput and
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitative goals in many ways that are
very distinct from qualitative groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when we bred many different plants
for food systems, flavor and nutrition and
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma were nearly left out, or were among
the last items to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to focus on agronomic targets
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to miss what the heirloom tomato is,
as opposed to the Roma or the not the Roma
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually a good tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit sort of flavorless,
you know, grocery market tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we're like missing this
substance in life, which is about being
[SPEAKER_01]: present centered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using your senses as a vehicle for
enlightenment, dare I say, this little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: correlates and even further afield with
like, the fact that we in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially are in a very puritanical
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to be cognizant of the
impact of that kind of culture that
[SPEAKER_01]: suppresses the senses that values work
above all things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and here I am in Europe, there's a very
different balance of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, there's a lot more focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in various places in Europe,
you go to the cheese shop, you go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bread maker, you go to these things,
of course, there's big chains and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, there's a much higher
level of development and sensibility
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to the expression of craft
products, I would say, across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a little bit less
puritanical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bit of a radical notion to
embrace the senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to that Yates quote, sort of like
there's all this magic in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And magic is a tricky word, I know for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just say that there's surprising
depth and dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you choose to focus on the sensory
experience of a product that opens,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is its own path, you know,
it's infinite in its range of expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll never find all of the possible
expressions, no matter how hard you work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have really tried to do that in my
own way, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm now a national judge for the
national cannabis competition put on these
[SPEAKER_01]: events have done all these things to try
to get to a position where I can truly
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify these different kinds of aroma
ranges, but it's infinite, but that is
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the passion of a cultivator
comes from me, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most exciting thing about cultivation
has always been discovering a new
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic expression, and a particular
aroma, diversity or intensity that's novel
[SPEAKER_01]: or that enriches my sense of what's
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is absolutely the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've also very much focused on
therapeutic use and having consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo type expressions, because I want to
be a resource for patients, they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: it for quality of life improvement in a
reliable way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I would also jump to
organic crop production, being so very
[SPEAKER_01]: important is that in decades of
cultivation, I have always used both
[SPEAKER_01]: organic cultivation methods and synthetic
mineral salt fertilizers and hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always done both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for an elite consumer focused flower
brand to not value organic cultivation is
[SPEAKER_01]: insane to me to see this industry develop
in a way, not just jumping directly into a
[SPEAKER_01]: critique of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this huge myth that's going on
when we're relying on two part synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salt fertilizers with very,
very thin emphasis on biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: or say rhizophagy or endophytes,
you know, the endophytic organisms that
[SPEAKER_01]: intracellularly congregate inside of the
plant, the fungal networks that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have evolved from the beginning of time
and partnership and synergy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things clearly up and down regulate
aromasynthesis and are a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this LinkedIn article recently by
Arroyo, who are amazing team, doing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of data driven cultivation support.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked, what's your favorite media?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like, it's rock wool,
core, perlite, and another hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate, I believe hydroton.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like, there was no sort of,
you know, living soil or biology rich
[SPEAKER_01]: media included.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, what a myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is absurd that we come to this
place where a product that has an
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyment that is most increased by aroma
intensity, we're using essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: production methods that are less effective
at evoking that kind of passion from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to others, we talked to Kevin
Jodry or folks, been around a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you consistently hear this message
that if you're really looking for the best
[SPEAKER_01]: organoleptic expressions, the best aroma
intensity and diversity in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you absolutely need to use high biology,
you know, whether it's a biology forward
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil, soil of substrate,
or your know, working like so many amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers like green source or, you know,
bio vortex or others using regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farm practices, to really support that
sort of expression in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish there was the white paper that
could evaluate that dynamic, that may well
[SPEAKER_01]: be something I'll get to work on in the
future, because I can't wait to come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with the kind of clarity I can now speak
about aroma with, with regard to organic
[SPEAKER_01]: crop production, I'm confident that's a
significant variable, and that the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has essentially taken a cheap and
easy way towards, you know, there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: fear of managing the agronomic crop
balancing of a rich organic program that
[SPEAKER_01]: is well founded, it does take a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeremy, real quick, a bit irrational.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went though recently with your
facility from, you know, organic bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient program to more of a living soil
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially moving towards that biological
aspect that you talk about with aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice a change in your cultivars
and how they were expressed when you made
[SPEAKER_00]: that change, made that switch?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can speak anecdotally about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is we have so many new
cultivars at the same time we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: new program and the new cultivars continue
to get more and more expressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my experience over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I just want to say that I think
that is definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, if we could just shift to well,
gosh, here, organic cultivation can
[SPEAKER_01]: improve that expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what happens after the plant is
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how that veers from say, ancient
cannabis culture, it would milk the
[SPEAKER_01]: freshly grown plant, it wouldn't even cut
or harvest that plant, but rather,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gather chaurus by hand and
create hashish and actually create a sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of means of a sort of shelf stability by
using the rind of the product itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: to capture all of that freshly milked
whole plant phytochemical inventory,
[SPEAKER_01]: that over time gets more and more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this word I love to have is
fidelity, it has low fidelity to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower itself, it becomes its own thing,
it's wine, it's fermentation almost,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know before Frenchy passed, there was up
to 50 compounds identified uniquely in
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish that started with the turpenoid
hashish that do not exist in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're showing up in the interactions
of all these VOCs on the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's very distinct from rosin and
the solventless outcomes that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: high fidelity to the flower that actually
are capturing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem with flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you look at even this is a
part of Frenchy's teaching and anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's in the sort of hash world,
it's that there's too damn much oxidative
[SPEAKER_01]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heads of the trichomes are,
you know, a thin veneer, swaxy cuticle
[SPEAKER_01]: that easily breaks down the oxidative
forces and then releases the VOCs and the
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I authored a white paper last year in
partnership with Dr. Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we created a novel solventless
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should share this with you too,
because it has in the back part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've open sourced many of the production
targets we've used at PROOF that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved over the years with lots of data
and insight using very specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's VPD or PPFD or every
ingredient we use in the program,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the kiss media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just open source that whole
program, because there's still so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't still can't just implement that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, in this paper, we showed you
the chemistry that is in the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: flower sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very technically dried or dried as
well as it can be using existing
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say PROOF, it's above average for
where I see a lot of the drying process in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose at minimum about 50% of the
mono-terpenes by the time you're done with
[SPEAKER_01]: drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if we use the language of the
hops industry, they have a word for
[SPEAKER_01]: spoiled hops or an idea for spoiled hops
that's related to a loss of more than 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the aromatic inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nearly spoiled by the time we frickin
dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a giant issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why whole plant fresh frozen has
become such a giant deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see living resin, which is,
you know, hydrocarbon distillate mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with whole plant fresh frozen aromatic
fractions, include more than terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, blended in and people grossly
prefer those products and all the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: market data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's still nowhere near to the
quality or quantitative depth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin, which, you know, doesn't separate
those things out, or you can, but doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The batters are, I'd say, my favorite
versions of high fidelity aroma forward
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin products don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, using Ethan's leadership,
developed a method for cryokeaf that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually uses whole plant fresh frozen,
but doesn't go into water hash because
[SPEAKER_01]: water, unfortunately, is also another
solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, even when you're making water
hasher losing a bunch of the water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: aromatic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we show you that data, it's all in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we paid a lot of money to like scale
labs to be able to illustrate that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, we preserve that 50% otherwise
lost mono terpene inventory, which on an
[SPEAKER_01]: analytical lab result is the best metric
to identify from a producer perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: our success at retaining aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to suggest that we're
moving into a conversation where the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain itself needs to evolve to
support the best quality of product or
[SPEAKER_01]: bets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's actually distinguish quality,
according to my friend Nick Ziegler,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think he's correct, should be more
narrowly applied as in quality analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: and quality control to particular steps in
the producer ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Character is actually a more effective
adjective to this describe the outcome of
[SPEAKER_01]: an organoleptic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're dealing with product character
when you're talking about aroma,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, I sometimes mistakenly
interchangeably use those words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody else does too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think it's important to
bookmark that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, the character of the product
going in the supply chain, once I've cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it down, dried it, so you've dried it not
so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you've lost more than that 50%
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's getting packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to go through,
you know, the wholesale channels,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to eventually be
distributed to retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's typically still in a glass
jar, at least in Oregon in our deli style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often there's lights involved,
definitely there's no temperature control
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things are oxidating, oxidizing
radically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quick experiment I did at home,
anybody can do this, cut down a fresh,
[SPEAKER_01]: freshly dried plant, excuse me,
cut down a fresh plant, dry it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put one section into the
refrigerator in an airtight, light proof
[SPEAKER_01]: container, and then put another just on
your shelf at ambient temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my experience is consistently that
within two to three weeks, the flower that
[SPEAKER_01]: stored at ambient temperature does not
smell anything like it did when all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that incredible product character was
expressed before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of that's lost, certain things
are more resilient than others like
[SPEAKER_01]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The haze and Jack inspired aromas are very
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have products that have been around for
years in the vault that still smell like
[SPEAKER_01]: that turpentine rich floral intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, the nuance and character
goes and it goes fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started by drying and then losing
most, then we've kicked it to the curb
[SPEAKER_01]: past that, comparing it to hops,
which is like pennies on the dollar,
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to the wholesale value of the
cannabis products for mature premium
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pack it in mylar at zero degrees once
it's, you know, in noble gases,
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment it's finished drying and they
do long term shelf stability trials and
[SPEAKER_01]: validate when it becomes spoiled and all
the stuff that the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do or brewers who put fresh beer
out on the pack on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's pro tip, look at the bottom of a
can of beer, you'll see the date it was
[SPEAKER_01]: released by fresh beer and tell me you
can't taste a difference in not fresh beer
[SPEAKER_01]: and by fresh maybe 30 or certainly under
60 days, but there's beer on the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 90 plus and if you're drinking say
a craft IPA, massive difference and they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're like Ben Edmonds at Breakside
Brewery, you go reclaim your product at
[SPEAKER_01]: day 45 if it's a fresh IPA because you
don't want to have that poor
[SPEAKER_01]: representation of your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see this in cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just sell it and it goes and it's beat
to hell and it smells like alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: hay or inert or worse, it had too much
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's got some blue cheese or ammonia
in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the off notes that I want
consumers to look out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could we do to change this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we would get more advanced with our
drying using water activity more
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would work more with like the cryokeaf
method and these solventless products that
[SPEAKER_01]: in concentrate constantly move through a
cold chain all the way to the end point of
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so proud of the Rossum that I build
that proof because with this team which
[SPEAKER_01]: includes our incredible Hashishin Fuji
Bongwater and our operator Val and this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole great team, we're finally
translating the quality of that living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil grown, LED driven, exciting new
boutique variety cannabis products all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to that end point of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go get a fresh sample batter of
grapple pie, it's going to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly diverse and dynamic and you're
going to enjoy that product so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I would say then the flower
sample that has now gone through
[SPEAKER_01]: non-temperature controlled long-term
storage and has been beaten all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a simple idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need temperature control
and airtight vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a contentious issue and we don't
have a ton of time so I can't go deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: into debating curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of long curing, gosh,
flowers are not hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all this oxidative surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you all the analytical lab
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you my sensory experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: With big groups now, that flower becomes
usually a bit fungal and highly oxidated
[SPEAKER_01]: and now you're left with the cannabinoids
and you've lost all this product
[SPEAKER_01]: character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more of something I can't explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people would benefit the most from
the freshest version of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get there, we'll have to use
temperature controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultra premium flower, I see going in
refrigerators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a sort of whole chain and
distribution that's refrigerated as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as packed in a low oxygen environment and
sustained once it's been well cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is in the supply chain we
have, this is where the solvent-less
[SPEAKER_01]: products are pretty remarkable in their
ability to get all the way to the endpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tiny and they're also expensive
but they're precious because they do
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly work to maintain that
integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the organoleptic voice and the aroma
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as cultivators, it's really
important to just have aroma in mind
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of Rob Clark and Mojave
Richmond who talked often about,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is an aroma therapeutic crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're missing the point if we're focusing
on strain names, THC, even dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, indica sativa hybrid,
and the nose really does know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is the nose doesn't
believe in itself so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to your sense of scent,
Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are a huge amount of
people who distrust their senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we touch on that, can you just take
me through, for a cultivator, your optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: process for sort of drying and curing a
plant from harvest on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in a little more concrete terms to
give people just a better idea with what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're comfortable sharing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've mentioned- Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colder, airtight, temperature controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, can you just touch on that before
we- Let's even rewind it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the drying process, first, identifying
peak maturity is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who harvest on the calendar eight
weeks or nine weeks routinely are
[SPEAKER_01]: generally missing the peak organoleptic
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: One example, we've been cultivating jokers
31 from, excuse me, jokers from the
[SPEAKER_01]: compound genetics team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge style-y profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that there's a 72-hour window
where that part of the profile peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eight and a half weeks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an example of a window of time
where if we want to capture that in its
[SPEAKER_01]: most expressive state, we need to harvest
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using sensory in the cultivation
facility to identify that, ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: combined with analytics, except in the
case of this one, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: gas, there's no
limonene-mercine-beta-karyophylline
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the compounds we would see in that
sort of a cush profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to say is, first,
it starts with when you harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's how you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're rapidly getting the freshly
harvested buck plants carefully into the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity controlled drying
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that where people have gone
awry in drying environments, is that
[SPEAKER_01]: ideally, if you could wave the wand,
you'd have two HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that's a beast that can take out a
majority of the water content in a short
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time, say 48 hours or less,
with aggressive dehumidification and being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to immediately, with the water
activity process, get down to your between
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.65, 0.85 water activity, so that
botrytis cannot occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: That knocks out a huge amount of crop
loss, but then have a second smaller HVAC
[SPEAKER_01]: system that stabilizes and carries those
trends, you know, for the duration of the
[SPEAKER_01]: qualitative components in the drying,
getting that 90% reduction of moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: down to, you know, 10%, pretty ideally,
between 8 and 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, the moment that's
achieved, being here's the big trick,
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitating a large scale crop into hand
trimming, the moment it's that perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture content and water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know many people that can pull it
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to probably cut some corners
occasionally, but the best you can
[SPEAKER_01]: mobilize a team to go through that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you start trimming at 12% or 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're monitoring it and not
sealing that product and being very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very careful with your water activity
monitoring to keep it in the safe zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then keeping that constantly from that
moment in a either inert gas means a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of CO2 and nitrogen blended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like 20% CO2, 80% nitrogen,
just hand fill that you don't even have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it with a really accurate, precise
method, but displace a majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen that's in the container where those
reactions are occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, even in burping,
we talk about burping, but Dr. Allison
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice was the first person who piqued my
awareness with the huge amount of effort
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the finishing gases,
they're off gassing in that flower
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene is a ripening agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can only speculate about what all it's
doing in cannabis, but look to everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that complex carbohydrates are
rapidly breaking down in the sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you imagine how fast the banana ripens
in the bag when it's ethylene is more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated than what's out in the open
and it's less concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine there's a similar dynamic and
that who knows, it may be advantageous to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trap in that ethylene, but I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to burp the excess CO2 and
ethylene, the excess moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you seal it in that inert gas
environment really correctly, but then
[SPEAKER_01]: going from there, it's this cold chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it in temperatures that are going to
be more like refrigerated temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never freeze product unless you intend to
rapidly use the product after you remove
[SPEAKER_01]: it from the freezer, because there's a
process called nucleation where
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially ice crystals are building up
inside of the plant cellular tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as they thaw,
it's an expansion and contraction
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise, it breaks and bursts these sort
of simple, these stores for the VOCs and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So refrigerated temps is my target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that you can stay at the
low side of refrigeration and that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be ideal, but most people are going to be
closer to probably 55%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly better than not having any
refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the cooler you can be,
the less brownie in motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great word I recently about the
way molecules move and even various
[SPEAKER_01]: liquids and chilled steaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially you want to package that
product and continue to sustain it in
[SPEAKER_01]: stasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the freshness is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not use or advise the use of Boveda
packs or other branded desiccants or
[SPEAKER_01]: humidificants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those really absolutely pillage
the aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been my experience personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see retail nearly universally using
those things, which is like a fix to
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that happen downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never add water back in,
you know, without compromising aroma or
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the likelihood for new biology
to grow there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think getting it correct in drying,
in transferring and in packing is more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a lot more emphasis on
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then keep it refrigerated all the way
to the point when the consumer is picking
[SPEAKER_01]: up and purchasing the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would see and smell a kind of sort
of experience that only the producers
[SPEAKER_01]: typically get access to, which is where
the most passionate people in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see why when you see this massive
aroma expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just share personally,
it's a bit heartbreaking to me when I know
[SPEAKER_01]: what the product looked like before it
went through all these main steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I see on a random spot by at some
retail where I have flour out and this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of really degraded expression and
it's still it looks good, it tests well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it sells well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still got some character.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one tenth or maybe even less of the
character it had before that whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really do want to see airtight,
you know, sort of light proof refrigerated
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging for elite flour products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point you start to realize
that's a bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting that only in
the last 50 years do we have this culture
[SPEAKER_01]: that is so about the flour itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, really love flour and I love
fidelity to flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just suggest that we also need
to be humble and acknowledging this
[SPEAKER_01]: ancestral ancient cannabis culture around
the world that for hundreds of generations
[SPEAKER_01]: worked exclusively on hash production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I love traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably my favorite product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not at all against the high
fidelity, exciting, massive rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem that's opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would suggest for people who don't
have enough experience, try not always
[SPEAKER_01]: against a distillate formulated live
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can absolutely discernibly feel a
difference for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less desirable, I get more narrow
effects, I get less sort of nuance and
[SPEAKER_01]: less, less good feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about keeping everything
together and this whole platform,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're not combining and recombining
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really just trying to capture the
peak freshness and maturity and carry that
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to the moment you ingest up
and in an inhalable or otherwise other
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one really quick weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did a trial where actually there's
like six different kinds of inputs in a
[SPEAKER_01]: gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, people were wondering,
well, does it make a difference to have
[SPEAKER_01]: these big whole plant phytochemical
inventories and gummies like isn't the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD the only compounds really getting
through the bile, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Natasha Riz, who used to be chief
science at genibus was one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: people to show me data about lavender and
linole getting all the way into the gut
[SPEAKER_01]: and being able to be a very powerful aid
to IBS and Crohn's therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very clear that the rosin infused
gummy, it's just a better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a much more enjoyable edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's easy to achieve what I'm
talking about with cold chain post process
[SPEAKER_01]: with hash and rosin products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to do that with flower
products in the current industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that people who have yet to
build out have a lot of opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate and use what we've learned
to be able to better facilitate this
[SPEAKER_01]: massive variable and consumer enjoyment
and to really then lastly, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not enough to do all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually do sensory science and you may
not be able to do it in house,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like we're collaborating with True
Turpene's team who will bring their folks
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully to the table to have a third
party characterize the products and this
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic process where they've done
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're effective in being able to create
their own blends and find the
[SPEAKER_01]: expressiveness and range.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back to the riff I was starting
before you asked the question about
[SPEAKER_01]: practical thoughts related to the post
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply this, you can imagine that
there are at least a trillion possible
[SPEAKER_01]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how much language do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fundamental challenge with
everybody who I think looks down the
[SPEAKER_01]: barrel of sensory science at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't trust that you yourself are an
expert or and most people are not
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly or that you can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that more people than I think
they then identify in that way could with
[SPEAKER_01]: the littlest bit of training or as a part
of a larger sensory process become
[SPEAKER_01]: educated and useful in this unfolding
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to encourage and it is
a challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to people who describe sensory
architecture and its shapes or who
[SPEAKER_01]: describe it as sound and have various
synesthetic modalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really tricky space because it's so
vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a million or a million
adjectives, let alone a trillion that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to deploy, but as we get
better, and you use groups to round it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, simply reporting a few adjectives
about what's exciting in that product from
[SPEAKER_01]: a sensory perspective, after you've done
your excellent cold chain close process,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll create a whole new level of cannabis
enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would argue that enjoyment is in some
ways tethered to therapeutic use and to
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really the maturing of what is in
very early stage, kind of new industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: this ancient culture that needs to be
addressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do that work with a variety
of teams and thrilled about the results
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think the nose knows,
but the next part of a statement I would
[SPEAKER_01]: add on is people don't trust themselves
yet though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the nose knows, but there's some
disconnecting cognitive dissonance,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm excited to do is to help support
people to be more effective in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even to encourage everybody to do
that, but at least on the producer side,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're spending your life cultivating
flowers and not working on sensory in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way that's above and beyond you using your
own anecdotal perspective, you're missing
[SPEAKER_01]: a giant part of how we can make the
richest, best, most valuable expressions
[SPEAKER_01]: of craft cannabis on the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really mean that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so really excited about this
conversation as it unfolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you've given us a lot to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know myself as a consumer, I want to be
more cognizant of my dosage, my
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, my mood, and how that relates
to the cultivar, how the plant was grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of these things to get a more
comprehensive understanding of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect is for me and how the plant
interacts with my personal endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which I've found is quite
different than the majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave us a lot to think about today,
and I'm so grateful for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a wonderful rest of your
trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more really quick thing in summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one other thought just to go all
the way back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think again about the person who walks
into the retail of this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: who may be from out of town, who may be
not hooked up and connected, who doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the elite cultivator group of
connoisseurs that you do, that really are
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to find their favorite
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the layers of bullshit they
have to wade through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica sativa hybrid, high THC,
strain name, terpene dominance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now we'll add proprietary marketing
effect language.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally five layers of deceit and
lies that stand in between the person and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say we do so well to start to just
remove all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take it away and educate retail staff
with sensory language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use language that actually is accessible,
that connects to people, but also that's
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's accurate and you have that
product and you finally find that sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: gosh, fermented blueberry with a floral
punctuated note with a sort of a top note,
[SPEAKER_01]: a middle and a bottom that's still got
gas, you're so delighted by that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want to reproduce it,
but you've at least internally mapped
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm in Dublin, there's this giant
whiskey museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at all these people and they've
been doing this for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to reproduce that amazing
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They of course have mouthfeel and actual
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, more to say, but you,
sir, thank you for this platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the opportunity and
privilege to get to communicate with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the amazing folks that tune in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just so grateful to you for also
the best version of an organoleptic
[SPEAKER_01]: enriching media that has happened
certainly in the last five years of proof,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the supply chain disruptions and chaos
that led me and Sam and Todd and the team
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the bold move to with absolutely
no time to trial, jump in headlong and to
[SPEAKER_01]: the necessity of agronomic balancing and
liquid injecting in small sized containers
[SPEAKER_01]: with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, your product is second to
none.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fantastic and helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, due to some technical
difficulties, the end of the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: recording was cut off, but we caught the
majority of the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to publish it as is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Jeremy Plumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post pertinent links on the podcast
page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the learn tab and then
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
See you next time.
