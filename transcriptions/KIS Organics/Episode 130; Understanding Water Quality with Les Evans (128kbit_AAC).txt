Welcome
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Cannabis Cultivation and Science
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a friendly reminder for folks who
enjoy the podcast content and want to
[SPEAKER_02]: support our small company, we have a
Patreon for the podcast where we do a book
[SPEAKER_02]: club, hangouts, and share private content
that we don't share on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also offer a wider range of products on
our Kiss Organics website ranging from
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils, LED lighting, beneficial
insects, organic fertilizers, and
[SPEAKER_02]: professional consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this week's podcast though,
we are talking all about water.
[SPEAKER_02]: DRAM is an industry leader when it comes
to equipment related to irrigation and
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Les Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Les has a degree in biological engineering
with a concentration in water,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, and environmental engineering from
NC State University and 29 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: industry experience helping growers of all
types of crops with their environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: and water quality challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Les's day-to-day involves supporting the
DRAM sales team and their customers with
[SPEAKER_02]: water treatment designs that maximize
investment while minimizing environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he's not at his desk, he can be found
planting perennials with his family or
[SPEAKER_02]: running the NC Mountains to Sea Trail
system, a stone's thrown away from his
[SPEAKER_02]: home in Raleigh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Les.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you were actually the third DRAM
person to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking before the show and you
mentioned, reminded me that Casey
[SPEAKER_02]: Schillenberg had been on the podcast
talking about fish hydrolysate and how
[SPEAKER_02]: it's made.
[SPEAKER_02]: If folks want to go back and check that
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the wonderful Kurt Becker also
came on and talked about all things water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a similar sort of
style podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently caught your webinar on
dissolved oxygen, and I will link to that
[SPEAKER_02]: for folks who want to go on a deeper dive
specifically into dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will talk about it today, but I really
have just a random list of questions
[SPEAKER_02]: related to water that I think will be
useful for growers to think about as they
[SPEAKER_02]: think about their water source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you tell me a little bit about
yourself before we dive into the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entered the greenhouse and nursery space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we call it CEA in 1995 out of NC State
University, biological engineer,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, soil and environmental engineering
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hired by a Swedish firm that is really
involved in controlling the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and greenhouses right out of school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just they sent me around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started seeing a lot of neat ways to
grow plants and have been in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: just ever since been with DRAM for I'd
have to do the math 12, 13, 14 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Kurt Becker and Casey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really friend does a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're from all over the place in terms of
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DRAM water sort of officially became a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making it up 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started really putting water
projects together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my job at DRAM is sort of the lead
designer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of vendors, of course,
that we work with and we take a customer's
[SPEAKER_00]: new project or problem specifically again
in DRAM water with their water and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put packages together for them that
could look like a very complex system or
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully very simple system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dissolved oxygen has become more of a
topic every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been learning a lot more about how
important dissolved oxygen is in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just something that we always
are talking about from, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most simple to most complex growing
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dissolved oxygen is something that just is
not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more we learn about it,
the more we realize how vital it can be to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a efficient healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were able to see that webinar
that the magazine hosted for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a reminder for folks,
if you are looking for a more complete
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering solution for your water in a
commercial facility or greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: DRAM is a wonderful resource for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually quite complex, the amount
of variables and things that go into that
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't recommend them enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also, since we're talking about a
little bit about their products as a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: plug, they make these wonderful water
breaker wands.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, I think, where he started in the
industry, as well as probably one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best sprayers, commercial sprayers that
I've ever seen and a very cool nematode
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket that Suzanne absolutely loves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a wide range of products that
are definitely worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if you're not a commercial,
scale grower, a lot of what we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about today, I think, will just apply
to water in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even think about it in terms of a home
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just start with dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting there, the big takeaways from
your webinar on that was that raising
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolved oxygen led to much healthier
plant outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of expand on that,
though, in greater detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, we are unable to apply as
much dissolved oxygen as we're learning
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant would like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the reservoir in my basement grow
or a 100,000 gallon tank or straight well
[SPEAKER_00]: water or what have you, it's just we
aren't providing that root zone system and
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant enough dissolved oxygen to be
in its happy place is kind of how I think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more we learn about its happy
place, the more complex it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it boils down to a lot of symbiotic
things working well together to
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently do what we also want to
happen, which is to have a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as much flower or fruit or color or
whatever we're wanting that plant to do as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so dissolved oxygen is something that
is part of every conversation we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we aren't doing anything to
manipulate it because we might have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's generally we're talking
about ways of even keeping what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: start with in the water longer and getting
it to the actual crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it's mechanically
adding it to a system to be able to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, it's just a lot of
conversations and understanding what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, what the media is, what
fertilizer regime you are, are you
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, are you salts, are you
combination?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this, again, it's a conversation
to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that dissolved oxygen as an
input should not be ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at all these other things
that we're applying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're doing to grow our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not ignore dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I have a reservoir, it's very
simple to add a bubbler and that will get
[SPEAKER_02]: me to sort of an ambient level of
dissolved oxygen, potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are ways to supersaturate
the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you touch on what that technology
looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can geek out on the reservoir increasing
dissolved oxygen and not shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves in the foot in doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned from a lot of the best and a
lot of colleagues and a lot of friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of and the smaller the reservoir,
the harder it can be to not shoot yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: in the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bottom line is we don't want to
overheat the water by putting a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's a really high end aeration
stone in the bottom of a 20 gallon res,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be increasing the temperature
dramatically, and that causes other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes a lot harder to keep any
dissolved oxygen in that water if we've
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the temperature of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we like to do is pick an appropriate
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's just, like you said,
some wonderfully simple things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we can stir the water,
it might be our classic dropping a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: little two gallon a minute fish pump in my
small reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I might use fancy mass transfer nozzles
in a 10,000 gallon tank, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: stirring the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep that dissolved oxygen in solution
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not mixing or bubbling the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to raise it to the
surface inappropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have made true dissolved oxygen,
we can keep it in the water longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depending on the vessel,
if we do have storage again from a 25
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon reservoir to a 5,000 gallon or
50,000 gallon tank, there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies in adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping the dissolved oxygen in
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, whether it be just a home grower or
a commercial grower, we're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at different ways of enhancing or just
keeping what we can in solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So temperature plays a big role in terms
of the water's capacity to retain oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: as the water gets warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't hold as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also thinking though we have to water
with water that's temperature appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: for the crop that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to water with 50 degree
temperature water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that balance look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're generally aiming for industry
standards, 68, 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our general happy place to not
shock young root systems, anything
[SPEAKER_00]: under...
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can handle quite a lot,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't want to apply cold water to
the younger the plant, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental it can become.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of studies out there, cold water to a
younger root system can really slow things
[SPEAKER_00]: down dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few hours of really cold water,
we've seen effect even a vigorous cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can slow it down by many days,
if not weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are interesting studies to go and
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm the dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, sort of, or one of many, but pay very
much attention to not applying too cold
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're nice, buffered, big living soil
environment, it's kind of got its own
[SPEAKER_00]: warmth, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to not matter so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a hydroponic grower,
if you're growing in stones, if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: have a more media less media free
environment, that water temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: really affecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the younger we're trying to grow those
root hairs, we're trying to do all these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too cold, things are just
thinking, oh, I got to go into dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready for something,
but it's not fruiting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about the seasonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I digress, but the colder the
water, we can hold more dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's make it really cold so I can
get more dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there is that fine line that you just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're aiming for mid 60s, mid 70s is the
happy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can put in five, six, seven,
eight parts per million of dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen within that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get it to the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what else is in the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to steal from the oxygen that
we're trying to create?
[SPEAKER_00]: The biofilms, the just goo, some of our
soils, we're adding dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it to the beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it to the appropriate things in
the rhizosphere before it gets stolen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the piping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, high temperature is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come out of solution really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't hold as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold has its own problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that happy medium when applying
it to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one question I asked you off air
that I was curious about is what DO levels
[SPEAKER_02]: are we getting using a DRAM water breaker
watering head?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in my brain, I figured there's got
to be some DO getting added just from the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism of the way the water is being
split into some small particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe I'm totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts around something
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my answer was, I think if we start at
zero, if we have just well water or
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal water coming right out of the
spigot, right out of our faucet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's near zero probably, we might be
lucky and have a couple parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still not a good level of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get things happening in
reverse if we apply anoxic or hypoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: water to a root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to go in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stealing oxygen out of the plant
because of osmosis properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to make sure we get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum when we say five parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does a water breaker help?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different flavors of water
breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been to a garden center and
seen the DRAM water breakers, typically on
[SPEAKER_00]: the retail side and what we see at home
grows is the 400 hole water breaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original aluminum one you can still
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice beefy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drag around on the concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the plastic ones, but they have
400 holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase a thousand holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally the idea for the water breaker
was to break up the water, to soften the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, to not compact the top layer of the
soil, which helps us have a more porous
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, which allows more oxygen to do what
it needs to do in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original idea was not to probably
add dissolved oxygen via the water
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking mechanism of a DRAM water breaker
or anybody's water breaker, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to increase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we started at zero, I think it's going
to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I happen to supply 10 parts per million
of DO, I might lose dissolved oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's smashing against the screen
and now it's introducing it to a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to try to reach equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I came at it with a real high,
like if I've got a DRAM water system and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 30 parts per million in my
reservoir, and then I'm spraying it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my hose, it's going to actually decrease
it versus if you can imagine a spaghetti
[SPEAKER_00]: tube, drip irrigation right to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 30 parts per million in the tank
and a lot of that, if not most of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on distances and elbows and
stuff, a drip emitter is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: right to the crop, right down into it if
it's a stake or a weight or however we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing versus hand watering, we're actually
going to get rid of all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 30 PPM of dissolved oxygen out of a
DRAM water breaker softens the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not smashing our soil everywhere,
but we're actually going to be taking 30
[SPEAKER_00]: and knocking it down hard because of the
pressure chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that takes gases,
dissolved oxygen out of water is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we're battling pressure changes
also, high temperature pressure changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: two things that are going to take
dissolved oxygen out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a neat conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned the screen air,
I think is the name of it, is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: meant to, it's a very expensive water
breaker for larger pots that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have longer grow times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just really softens the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got inputs on the top of the nozzle
to allow air in as that stream comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of infusing more air than we
ever would in a normal water breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the screen air, DRAM screen air is a
neat, funny thing for generally much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pots than your outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely helping, taking well
water generally in a big field of hemp or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be out there all season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good talk about water breakers for
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we water with any type of water,
regardless of the DO level, we're also
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing oxygen as a physical mechanism of
that water, pushing oxygen down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil as well, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what that soil looks like,
if you have DO in your water and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on if we can get dissolved
oxygen to the surface or even subsurface,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of sub irrigation out there,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depending on how we're applying
the water and there's so many factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it clear water that we're applying to a
living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fertilized water with just salts or
have we added things to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depending on how we've made the
dissolved oxygen, in what form it's in,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it truly dissolved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it soluble in the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how we're applying it to the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're just hand watering it onto
the surface, that's probably an
[SPEAKER_00]: inefficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if we've made a lot of dissolved
oxygen, I'd do whatever I could to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: get it smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say laminar flow through a hose and
then gently onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to keep the oxygen in solution
longer than a water breaker would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be cognizant of what you're using a
water breaker to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's a wonderful watering tool
and it's there for a big reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't want to shoot ourselves in
the foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what options do I have in a scenario
like here at my house?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using essentially a drip irrigation
system directly from my hose, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: hooked up to municipal water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I address dissolved oxygen in a
situation like this where I don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any affordable options for
growers like myself in this scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So venturi injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we make it anymore,
but it was a really neat tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stife inject.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a venturi injector that is just
pulling air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're leaving the tube out of,
usually it was used to put a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock the pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would put it in your bucket and it
just had a tube and it's just using the
[SPEAKER_00]: water flow across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could use it to introduce
atmospheric air has 21% oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is urine, the most common and
trickiest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a reservoir,
if you aren't refilling a reservoir and
[SPEAKER_00]: then utilizing that for watering,
I'm in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to state that in my perpetual
tomato garden, I have a reservoir and it
[SPEAKER_00]: refills and I add oxygen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use a sub irrigation platform that I
just, it's super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was traveling a lot,
I could rely on things to keep happening
[SPEAKER_00]: when I needed to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I had zero parts per
million DO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worried me just because I was going
to be pulling from my, especially in sub
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation, where it's just sort of using
that water as it needs to, the little
[SPEAKER_00]: valve opens and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way with the living soil to
grow my tomatoes really efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had it hooked up like you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just felt like I was adding probably
some inappropriate things, even if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using a little, one of those RV carbon
filters, which I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was doing a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for a few thousand gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer your question is maybe
venturing injection, but that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to think on that one because
it's something that we get asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really the media, the porosity
of your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that if you're using soils over
and over again, that you are making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been well blended and do all those
things that you guys teach us about in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really making sure that we have
air spaces in there to allow natural
[SPEAKER_00]: things to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we do not overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underwatering, bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwatering, of course, just as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we try to teach especially new
production cannabis growers to be drier
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just irrigate for the sake of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the moisture level,
depending on your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure that we are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally an over irrigation problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's bad for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, you're not worried about
wasting a few dollars worth of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: or organics, but the larger facility,
that becomes a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just you start chasing your tail
if you're over irrigating in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: media saturation and porosity and
available oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find with folks switching from a more
traditional hydroponic or chemical growing
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral salt environment to growing with
living soils, they actually tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: underwater because they're used to these
pretty big drybacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm coming out from a different
perspective, interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, overwatering leads to root hair
death, which will cause a lot of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: issues as underwatering and is potentially
just as awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say you're opening yourself up to
more root diseases like Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big reason to switch onto
overwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually just having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge fan of sub-irrigation,
but if you're a new grower, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: an excellent option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like in your case, where you're having
to leave for a while, it's a wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: tool to keep from avoiding these massive
fluctuations in hydrology that cause these
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed us non-professional green thumb
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to get by really well,
but it is not steerable in any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have massive production and I've
been involved with flood floors since 19
[SPEAKER_00]: forever ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood benches, flood floors have been a
large component of large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture from ornamentals to
vegetables, et cetera, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know that it can be very,
very effective depending on the crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things, but you've got to
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's just tougher to steer a
crop, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's great goods and bads depending
on what you're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on from dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've definitely got me thinking though,
and I'm going to want to look into now
[SPEAKER_02]: adding a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit more about
filtration, but also a Ventura.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little, little levels and I
worked for biotherm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you know the biotherm guys,
I was there for nine years working for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the O2 tube and not to plug it
company, but we use their, their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their DOS X series, which is diffusion,
which is mass transfer, gas, and fusion in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case, oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have small systems, you know,
for real small hobby sized grows to really
[SPEAKER_00]: do an impressive job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how small they go though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a product that came on board a
lot later after I left working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's companies out there
that you can go and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'd be fun to incorporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would carbon filter it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that before you spend the
money to infuse any oxygen into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, we're going to jump
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to cover a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That people just have that are just really
general questions about water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off talking about the
differences between chlorine and
[SPEAKER_02]: chloramine for people that are on
municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the PhD on this subject,
but have had to be the, what's that
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial?
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed at a holiday Inn express last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar, like all of a sudden
you sort of, Oh, well, but on that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the chlorine has been
traditionally used as an oxidizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: an effective oxidizer of chlorine,
as we all know, has been used in pools and
[SPEAKER_00]: in municipal water treatment plants for,
for eons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does what it does and generally becomes
harmless if we are doing it correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of course we have learned to do in
our city municipal systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've learned, not we, the,
the water treatment folks have needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more residual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've needed this disinfection power for
last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine again has, you know, it's half
life is decent enough to do what it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we probably aren't getting,
I hope a lot of free chlorine parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million out of, you know, your faucet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smelling chlorine, I'd probably
call, you know, the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm on a municipal system and you can
smell chlorine, like a swimming pool or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that's probably not the levels
you want coming into your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or certainly you'd need to consider trying
to get rid of it in your home before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really trying to keep pipes
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramines were added again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become trickier from what I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a quick chat about it before we
started recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramines have been added and they've
been really added we've seen since COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they started testing the
effluents going back into water treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can study how, you know, the COVID
trends, I guess they started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous and they started turning up the
dial on a higher residual Chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw certain municipal plants and
these are generally from Dramwater working
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis facilities, new facilities,
some of them, smaller operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: other MSOs that had been burned in one
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really with us taking a hard look at
municipal, we started asking the municipal
[SPEAKER_00]: folks questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are seasonally, municipal water
has changed way more drastically than I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a well water on average, because
they've had to, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer, the grows in the
corridor of Michigan are pulling from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake and the water temperature increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bad bacteria, because of the water
temperature increasing from the lake,
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have turned up the dial,
literally, variably turned up the dial and
[SPEAKER_00]: added Chloramines to try to get rid of a
higher BOD biological or oxidative demand,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bad stuff they're trying to kill for
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Chloramine, that's what I feel is
turning into things we really don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Chlorine, if done right,
we aren't too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been, we've been drinking that
water for decades and decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Chloramines to me is still,
proof is not in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure I'm getting rid of
them and asking more questions to my
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal treatment folks about their use
of Chloramines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's the takeaway, it's learn if
there's Chloramines being added to your
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a conspiracy theorist or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing everything we can very
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what if that water is actually
super clean, and now the Chloramines don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything to get it to get rid of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't it isn't doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in the water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen Chloramines come out into
our irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something I want to be sure to
remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, well, you might ask me about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But filtering it out right off the get go
is generally a very inexpensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: great insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's pretty familiar with the
carbon filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so carbon media has changed a little
bit over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's become much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question like on the
questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there Chloramines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I'm going to make you spend a
little more money on a different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more efficient at adsorbing those
those Chloramines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give you my very limited
knowledge on Chlorine and Chloramine to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and simplify this for folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And please correct me where you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning from each other,
learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it's been explained to me over the
years, because I've been hearing about
[SPEAKER_02]: Chloramine for over a decade now because
they have it in, I think, Portland,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon, which is not too far away from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Chlorine here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chlorine, like you said, pretty
unstable chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reacts with oxygen and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the constituent remains is fairly
safe, like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chloramine, I thought, changed to
Chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think ammonia was what I was reading
recently about it, are sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: constituent remains of what happens when
it comes in complexes or comes in contact
[SPEAKER_02]: with organic matter, biological microbial
life, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorine, very stable component.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave water out with Chlorine in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will off gas over time, or you can
bubble it to remove Chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chloramine, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has to come in contact with
something biological or some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter, whether that be an old
boot, a handful of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon filtration is the simplest and
easiest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you've got me thinking about a
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I don't tend to worry about
Chlorine or Chloramine relative to a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty low on my list, primarily
because I've always been under the
[SPEAKER_02]: assumption that my soil is so biologically
active.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has such high levels of organic matter,
much higher than even agricultural soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: to where what may potentially be dying is
being replaced so rapidly, and the level
[SPEAKER_02]: of Chlorine is so low that I tend to be
not too concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't noticed any detrimental effects
from watering with Chlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, what you're bringing up,
I think, is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't thought about it post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had to deal with Chloramines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard you could use the sorbic acid
also as a good solution, vitamin C
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually some commercial
sorbic acid products specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: removing Chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was called VitaDeclore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a product we used back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's sort of my take on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume, too, if I'm watering with
something like a water breaker where that
[SPEAKER_02]: water is in such small particulates,
a finer droplet size, as that water is
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling through the air towards the
soil, it's coming in contact with a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how much Chlorine is really even
making it in the soil at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not overly worried about an
appropriately Chlorinated municipal water
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am asking a lot more questions on
Chloramines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are adding Chloramine,
and it feels like there's more flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramine, then again, you and I will
learn together and find somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what's what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've heard the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in combination, Chloramines and
organic matter have created some really
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty things, it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to go down that rabbit hole
offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do find some answers, please reach
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about not so great things in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question I had for you was PFAS,
those forever chemicals that you keep
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear they're everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your experience or knowledge around
dealing with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: More personal than business in terms of I
haven't run up against anybody that was
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about PFAS in their
horticultural, their irrigation water,
[SPEAKER_00]: or supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has absolutely been a topic where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting in Raleigh, North Carolina,
and we have these forever chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: producing manufacturing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a couple hours drive of me,
it has absolutely gotten into the water
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a problem for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep learning more and more about these
nasty things that are manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget, anti flammable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of chemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do not go anywhere ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come into our bodies and they
stay there and they are very carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a real mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be working with some experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody brought it as a potential
contaminant in their water supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really go somewhere quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't just us making our best guesses
and Googling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want to reach out to people that
really knew what they were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is it's probably not terribly
difficult to get out of a water stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with these is that they have
contaminated aquifers and the soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're part of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your well is contaminated, dig a deeper
well, get a clean aquifer, I think is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the sad reality is of me and understanding
if they're there, it's just tough to
[SPEAKER_00]: remediate them or get rid of them out of
the environment that once they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they're just being recycled again
and again and part of our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be something that I would not
mess around with in terms of just assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: we could get rid of them with our typical
methods, which we can get rid of some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nasty things or some pretty basic
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned aeration to get rid of a lot
of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of things that we can do
simply, but these are a different beast
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why you are appropriately
hypersensitive to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's jump into filtration really
quick then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you touch on what removes what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously RO, reverse osmosis is the best,
the top of the line option for removal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're saying no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't call it the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has downsides for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get rid of a lot,
most everything, whether you want it to or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't just throw RO at a cannabis,
we will have, man, okay, first,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think you need RO, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just that's what you do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow with RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we have a discussion about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've become very aware that it's not
something that should just automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of, hey, I'm going to spend some
real money on my facility or on my grow,
RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the case and we've seen it,
not just cannabis production, but another
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, especially in indoor growing,
let's just take whatever water it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how good or bad it is,
and we're going to RO it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's just talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO is absolutely a really good tool at
removing everything and starting from
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we do that in our industry if
then we're going to add PPMs back into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if all those PPMs were,
most of them were fine and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: stripping them all out and now you're
paying to add them back in, in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, right, and getting our parts per
million back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, we just question, we use RO for
salts, high chlorides, high bicarbonates,
[SPEAKER_00]: like these things you can't filter out,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to use an RO membrane and RO
to remove or reduce salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our stances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely necessary when it is
necessary, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we blend back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we blend back this crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm growing in soil beds, in a living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to start with high quality
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can talk us into using more and
more pure permeate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So RO makes permeate and then it makes the
reject water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can add, we can blend back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our systems have the ability,
whether you think you're going to need it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, to blend back in the untreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's been carbon filtered and then
not softened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm blending my carbon filtered water
that hasn't gone through the RO back in
[SPEAKER_00]: with my RO permeate at zero to 50% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That RO machine starts paying for itself a
lot more if we don't have to use RO
[SPEAKER_00]: permeate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's rare that we're going to recommend
RO permeate be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very aggressive water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can pull nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to make itself whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of bad things about a pure
RO permeate, especially in young,
[SPEAKER_00]: young crops that are trying to,
you know, it's super small root systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and fine hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could slow things down, just like that
cold water scenario I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irrigation with pure RO permeate,
you've really got to know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's just trying to make itself
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's RO is the extreme, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original question I wanted to ask
you though was like, so what does,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, a simple carbon filter not
remove?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple carbon filter cannot remove salts,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how fatty it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's catalytic, activated carbon,
and now catalytic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two medias that are our go-to medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalytic is just a little more efficient,
a little more expensive, a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient removing chloramines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stickier sponges, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they cannot remove salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can remove a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can adsorb some levels of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have heavy metals, it's
typically not the only filter we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know, man, I've got high levels of
boron, barium, nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things, some of it could be adsorbed
by accident on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we really would need to make sure
we look at levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, certain heavy metals,
we can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Les, can you clarify when you say salts
that you're not just talking about sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: for folks that are listening in case
they're not familiar with sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: broader chemical salt term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, salts can mean a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when in the nursery and horticulture,
we ask, are you a synthetic grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing with salts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, salts are chlorides, potassiums,
manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all types of salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't take those out with carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have way high levels of salts or
your water is hard, sodium bicarbonate,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things we need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we start looking at a salt
removal machine reverse osmosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultrafine filtration, but really to remove
soluble salts, which again, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just sodium, but a whole strip of the
periodic chart are essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: we call them salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're easily, they become soluble in
water and we can't physically get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do special things to remove
salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would something like an ozone
machine be for, if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: filtration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone is like, it's an oxidizer
disinfection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide
oxidizers we're using to disinfect the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ozone, not necessarily a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does almost always require some thought
about pre-filtration and post-filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're using ozone as a disinfectant,
ozone super efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you go to the webinar,
I get into it a little bit, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we needed its use for disinfecting and
for precipitating out metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get rid of irons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get rid of these other,
if we have high levels of metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, with the periodic chart,
we've got metals, metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we precipitate those out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd hate to have to inject a ton of
chlorine, which is a way we would do so
[SPEAKER_00]: with small levels of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone is so powerful and is so reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can harness its powerful oxidizing
power to precipitate out metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get iron oxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not filtering it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're removing the iron, precipitating it
out, and then we have to filter it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we're going to have its
precipitate clog up anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least the iron, we get it out of
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple ways of removing high
iron, which is a problem all around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country with wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've always seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope some of us have the orange stain in
our well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's iron, typically soluble iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to desolidize it and
capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to filter that out, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ozone, not necessarily a filter,
but it can be part of a filtration system,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other major ways of
filtering water?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we touched on disinfecting with
ozone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides carbon and RO, I like to break
it into my simple brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mechanical filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have particulate, if I have things
floating in the water, that is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of filter than if I'm
trying to remove some chemistry out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by chemistry, we've talked about
chlorine, chloramines, salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the water chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to alter or remove things
that are too high of a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's those kinds of filters that can
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filtration happens to have those
properties of being able to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of chemistry of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I'm just trying to remove silt
out of a well that's just got silty water
[SPEAKER_00]: that clogs up my micro-irrigation,
it just really becomes a hindrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to remove physical
particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole different set of filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, are there a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen filters, media filters,
sand filters are an old-school media
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're one and the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: A well can have high, high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like rotten eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got high hydrogen sulfide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I need a physical filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I need a sort of a chemical
filter-type system to change the water on
[SPEAKER_00]: two different levels, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So physical filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, it's sort of more of a
chemical altering or removal filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So jumping back to straight RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you brought up a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: People should absolutely test their water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't assume that you need RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: RO is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always heard RO referred to as hungry
water because it wants to bond with
[SPEAKER_02]: various minerals and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you add it to your soil or
when it goes through a pump system,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said, it could pick up things
that we may not want to be adding to our
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a good story on heavy
metals that you shared with me that let's
[SPEAKER_02]: get to here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the quick question I had, because you
already answered the question of why not
[SPEAKER_02]: use straight RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's a good target PPM just broadly,
possibly, that a folks listening could aim
[SPEAKER_02]: for if they did need to use RO?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a terrible question, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because where did you start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you started at an EC of 2.0,
and I'm an EC guy, tell me where your PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What PPMs are you trying to hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me in a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk me through the PPMs, your averages
that you like to see, that your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me those ranges so they're fresh in
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to go and I would use a
calculator, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys come to us, PPMs,
and we talk about the makeup of an EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start parsing that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that an EC of 1 to 2 is a heavy
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean in terms of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that 500 PPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you're approaching this from the
perspective of I'm furtigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm maintaining my overall plant
fertility through chemical fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_02]: continually adding that small levels of
fertility throughout the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, we get all types
listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking of it like the majority
of my fertility is already in my soil
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm an organic living soil guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, I'm looking at the water
purely for irrigation purposes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question back at you is are any
PPMs needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hate to say that RO water isn't going
to hurt your crop that has all the PPM it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs in the soil, in your amendments,
in that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm throwing the question back
at you to teach me what is the PPM makeup?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it made of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's harmful or adding salts or
something that if we're trying to cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, if I'm coming in with too high a
PPM, you're asking the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is that level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that as an average because
you could have a hotter mix because you
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, again, you're teaching me on the
organics and living soil side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying it might be very different
for somebody who's just really trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, generally we're most all trying to
create the same kind of product,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do it within that same timeframe of
this plant that is an annual in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to answer it if somebody
is growing not cannabis or not tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_00]: not something that's fruiting or if it's a
longer term crop or we have customers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing cacti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And propagating cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, man, there are air plants
that are tons of folks that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, production, small, medium and
large of air plants where we get closer
[SPEAKER_00]: and closer to zero PPM required,
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot handle high levels at all if
it's a, if it's an air type style,
[SPEAKER_00]: bromeliads, orchids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to wear your hat, but then the
hat of 99 different other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, in your world, I think to start
with the water and look at the PPM of your
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal, let's just say a municipal
source coming into your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're gardening with that
municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a look at it and go,
are those PPMs okay for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you guys have pretty even
the PPM makeup because what makes a PPM is
[SPEAKER_00]: a, it's like a soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have added the soup has got the
PPM, but my soup's got, I've got a chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: stock base.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife's got the vegan thing going on
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if our PPMs are exactly the same,
but they're completely made up
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be afraid to add mine onto a
certain kind of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not smart enough to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to simplify the question and
you're telling me it's too complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying like, if, if we get the
soil or the water, sorry, if we get the
[SPEAKER_02]: water down to 50 PPM, but that 50 PPM is
also sodium, it may still be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that PPM is like calcium, then we just
need to account for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's perfectly fine in our,
over our fertility plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I'm trying to get to,
because we see people take out good things
[SPEAKER_00]: and add it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see people very appropriately on
purpose by accident, take out the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things and then add their good things back
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that PPM is a soup in my brain of could
be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, well, it's free calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to not harm your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we don't want to have anything
become toxic levels and build up over our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our life cycle or crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, or if we're growing trees
or nurseries, wow, we've got to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: cognizant of a 50 year crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can imagine, we have customers that
they're growing nursery stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe a better question or approach
then would be to say, okay, let's,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's set targets for all of these bad
actors, whether that's chlorides,
[SPEAKER_02]: bicarbonates, sodium, and say,
when we hit that threshold, let's say we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to see more than, I'm going to
make up a number here, five PPM of sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: overall in that RO water or in our
remineralized water before, at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have to take action and we can
feel comfortable using it as, as our
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that 50 PPM of sodium as a total,
as a total in my water is entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: comprised of sodium, then that may put us
above our target threshold and we'd have
[SPEAKER_02]: problems still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why is it so important that we
remineralize water in this scenario?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I do know of growers that water was
straight RO in living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, it is more buffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, we don't see as many issues,
but I feel like it's sub optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it is too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be completely
anecdotal or feel that way, but it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a hungry water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemistry is the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is trying to make itself whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very aggressive and meaning it's
going to pull and make it grab and break
[SPEAKER_00]: apart certain things that you might not
want broken apart in terms of bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's, you know, pure
permeate would be an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment to really take a look at it in
terms of beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't think its properties
would behoove the life cycle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine it increasing their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I feel like it would be harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now just sort of coming up with things
that we use and we make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: an appropriate media, you know,
and based on, on the media type or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep depending on if we're talking
from hydroponics all the way to where you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do and the organic side of
things, I think RO obviously becomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes nearly impossible to work
within hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do a lot of lettuce bath systems,
like acres and acres of floating lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: bath systems, 41 to 50 days crop cycles
from seedlings to harvest at the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: of a big long greenhouse on these,
you know, really neat production
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a, we have to really be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some buffer in the water,
but it's purely hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the razor's edge in pure,
pure hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you get away with a lot more
very positively in living soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, because you have such a
proliferation of all the beneficials,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the, the, the health of the
crop and really just becoming very
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful and watching out for the root
system when you, when you have the living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot to talk about by so much
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really good transition
because you mentioned how we have much
[SPEAKER_02]: better buffering capacity in living soils
than with these other forms of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of growing yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still believe that the pH of my water
can matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't always matter, you know,
but it can matter specifically around this
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of alkalinity and hardness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, which, which relates to,
and again, correct me on anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: it relates to the ability of the water,
of the water to change that pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the buffering capacity of that
water or ability, your ability to change
[SPEAKER_02]: the pH of that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if your water has a very high EC,
if it has a lot of alkalinity,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could impact the pH of your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, these microbes and the
rhizosphere interactions, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely play a role in, in buffering
that and, and transitioning it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: form, into a pH range.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be more optimal for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my perspective has always been if we
water with water, that's been properly
[SPEAKER_02]: pHed and, you know, assuming that the
alkalinity is high and we need to adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: the pH, if it's low, you know,
rainwater, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's eight, eight, you know,
eight, two, I'm not that worried about it
[SPEAKER_02]: because that pH can swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with RO low PPM, RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't worry about pH, but if we can make
water that has high in alkalinity into a
[SPEAKER_02]: better pH range, I would assume that that
would allow the plant to put its energy
[SPEAKER_02]: and those microbes in its energy into a
more efficient plant processes that would
[SPEAKER_02]: increase its health and growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is, it is easier to talk about
in a soil-less environment because water
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry is everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The water, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you just said, if we are,
if we have zero buffers, zero alkalinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: things change immediately, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And titration is how we test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can barely remember, but you,
you keep dropping drops into this water
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one, the next droplet,
everything shifted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to the top and then it just
plummeted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an interesting experiment in
how quickly a non-buffered water
[SPEAKER_00]: environment can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, we call it the razor's
edge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to steer a crop,
if you're trying to utilize zero
[SPEAKER_00]: alkalinity water, pure RO permeate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got, you've removed, you've stripped
everything, and now you, it changes really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly depending, it can be very
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buffer you're, you've provided in the
media, in the soil, in the organic soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely going to be less dependent,
a lot less dependent on hitting that pH
[SPEAKER_00]: just right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're a completely salt-based grower,
synthetics, non-organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: production facility, that pH 5.8 to 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we want 5.85, we want five,
what do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this crop like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrangea in that peak media versus,
I mean, it's just, you know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've dialed that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are hitting that in your, I,
it's just a way happier, easier window of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH to be applied to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine it's really rare a water
source well and certainly municipal that
[SPEAKER_00]: come, that would come out with a pH that
you'd have to be concerned about if you
[SPEAKER_00]: knew what you were doing on the organic
soils growing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're a hundred percent correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to watch what, again,
what are the PPMs made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that alkalinity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, are we accumulating too many salts
because of that municipal water or that
[SPEAKER_00]: well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it have a high iron?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen iron levels, it's really
detrimental and we have to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the water, absolutely perfect,
but 15 parts per million iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really affects different things that,
you know, I mean, again, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having to, there's a lot of things
that if you're getting your, your media
[SPEAKER_00]: made for you based on your water
chemistry, that's a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For larger production facilities,
their media is being made for them based
[SPEAKER_00]: on my well water source, which is,
that's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're matching, oh, my well water has got
this, so make me a blend that compliments
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in organic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an organic, I mean, a wonderfully
living soil, organic water only media,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we get away with a lot more,
meaning it's a lot easier to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: various water chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's super appropriate and a
really, really wonderful way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that being said though,
I would, I would still, I would still
[SPEAKER_02]: state that I believe pH of the water does
matter and it's something that we should
[SPEAKER_02]: be paying attention to on the water test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you brought up was a good point
is what's creating that pH is really the
[SPEAKER_02]: key to a lot of that, a lot of what we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you have to know what's in your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're injecting anything, even
organics, if you're putting an additive
[SPEAKER_00]: for that last couple of weeks,
a flower, you know, if you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: something extra in it, that pH,
if it's, if it's acidic or if it's non
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic, if it's neutral, how does it
affect whatever you're adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pH will make things more or less
available and could alter their form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you asked about acids and types of
acid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Citric acid for organic growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my next question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a simple question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking you, what are the, your favorite or
best pH adjusters?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you looked at me and like that was a
huge question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you an answer, then a thousand
colleagues would be like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, I mean, everybody has their own
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic growers are sort of stuck with the
citric acid, I think is one of the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there anything else out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a super weak acid that sort
of dissipates quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough to utilize on large production
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found this out firsthand from our large
cannabis growers that were using citric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so it's a wonderful discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are in pure big scale commercial
horticulture, it's buy it as most cost
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient to get to your doorstep as you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is typically, unfortunately,
as high a percentage of phosphoric or
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfuric acid as you is legal to purchase,
you know, 400 gallon, 270 gallon totes or
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 gallon totes of as high percentage,
caustic danger, you know, like it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's a shame, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But so depending on what you're trying to
do, it can be a very expensive input for
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were trying to use a weak acid to
take 8.0 to 5.8, at a thousand gallons a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute is you've got to start with the
most concentrated acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two complete extremes
are, are the citric acid and its strength
[SPEAKER_00]: and compared to a, you know, high sulfuric
or phosphoric, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other factor for folks to consider
is that all of these can potentially bring
[SPEAKER_02]: in heavy metals as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to make sure you have a clean
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And citric is just gets very expensive on
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to hold your pH for
very long in a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is pH creep just waiting to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to use that water quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make up too much of a batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make it, use it,
make it, use it, make it, use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and still test it when it's
coming out of your dripper or your hose,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make sure, because we're going,
if you've crept in the, in that wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, and we're applying 8.0 pH water
to it, like you were saying, it does
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly going to affect things
over to the life cycle of a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the younger the crop, I like to think
the more susceptible the root systems
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's matched, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we've matched to the root zone mass
with the production we're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more critical the younger the crop is
when we first got our small little
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants or our plant, we've really got
to pay attention to it because it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant hasn't reached its,
its full efficiency yet down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we talked a little bit off air about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to share with you my experience
and story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was hoping you could kind of
expand on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a, I have a good friend who's
growing medical in a, in a state where
[SPEAKER_02]: they also have rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: He decided to test his product to see if
it would, would pass his flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he found it came back high in arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would have actually potentially
failed for arsenic and he's growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's reusing his media.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was sharing this data with me
and he was looking at it and he was using
[SPEAKER_02]: things like soft rock, phosphates kelp
meal, but being very conscious of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being that he's an engineer,
he was looking at how much you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what PPMs of arsenic specifically was that
adding to his overall load, his soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he basically, the long story
short was he found that relative to his
[SPEAKER_02]: water source, which I think, um,
first of all, he had to get it tested to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lower detection limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause his original test wasn't low enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and this is municipal water that is
perfectly safe to drink by EPA standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're drinking whatever that
is, a gallon or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: A day, totally safe levels of arsenic,
but he was putting 40,000 gallons of that
[SPEAKER_02]: water through his grow room in a given
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that 0.2 PPM of arsenic,
let's say, you know, very safe levels was
[SPEAKER_02]: building up in the soil over time and
actually contributing potentially way
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sorry, someone was logging into my
zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I count.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll cut this part out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that, that level of, uh, the level of
heavy metals in that water, that level of
[SPEAKER_02]: arsenic was actually contributing way more
to the overall, uh, amount of arsenic
[SPEAKER_02]: being added to his soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, uh, the soft rock phosphate or the
kelp meal, uh, became rather significant
[SPEAKER_02]: from an arsenic load.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tested this by testing his flower
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he set up an RO filter and he found
that the next cycle, his arsenic levels
[SPEAKER_02]: had dropped in his final flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was assuming this was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his next test, the levels went up
and he was totally stumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Oh, my whole theory is not
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, I cannot figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, two months later, he reaches out and
tells me that he found out his plumber had
[SPEAKER_02]: put the filter in backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he fixed the filter,
he just flushed everything that was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: filters through into the beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so essentially all that arsenic went
right into the beds anyway, it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: like, and he was right back where he was,
um, fast forward another year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few more cycles and he's seeing
levels significantly lowering every cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of the amount of arsenic in his
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does seem to be working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this idea of, of, can we reduce the
amount of overall heavy metals coming in
[SPEAKER_02]: to a rate that's lower than what's going
out in the plant, this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper accumulator in the case of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I guess my big takeaway is that
water is actually probably our,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of our biggest contributors of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to look at it at a very low
detection limit, potentially much lower
[SPEAKER_02]: than what would be much lower for
agricultural use than what would be safe
[SPEAKER_02]: for drinking use as humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that, all of that is a perfect
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that represents what we have
run across multiple times over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and cannabis growers have really
taught us because of its hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, um, and testing the flower
is the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fascinating for us to watch how
the smallest parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, I mean, it's just,
it's, exactly the story over and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again, it's all a question
of where did it come from and how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your, your friend's story is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was coming in on the water source
and he just accumulated too many ounces or
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds over the crop cycle, especially in
that soil bed that you reuse incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: important to make sure we are watching
what our soup is made out of, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's completely safe to eat the
soup, if I keep pouring soup, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to just those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the water, just imagine the water
evapotranspiration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It, we're going to accumulate what all of
those things that were in the soup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the soup was fine to drink,
but a gallon after gallon of soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to just left with this
pile of who knows what, what is it made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that water test is you've got to
make sure I mentioned in a follow up to
[SPEAKER_00]: your story of some of the highest level
best growers, um, that were, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, don't mean to poo poo RO permeate
and to grow with pure permeate again,
[SPEAKER_00]: just really got to know what you're doing,
but it is this hungry, aggressive water
[SPEAKER_00]: failed his first flower test in a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, I believe barium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What barium heavy metal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How on earth zero barium in the original
water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been stripping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RO permeate had been stripping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, I think it was a chromoly coating of
old pump impellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pumping mechanisms, uh,
and this RO permeate had pulled this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, heavy metals out of the pump and it
had accumulated so well in this super
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient hyperaccumulating cannabis plant
that he failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured that out the hard way,
but it all worked out, bought new pumps
[SPEAKER_00]: with appropriate, you know, everything,
uh, and no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just where did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that story and the others that
are just, yes, your water source water is
[SPEAKER_00]: super important, but it's the system to,
you know, after that, let's take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole system too, and see what other
potential contaminants could be introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: and why it's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I learned a ton of things and I hope
we can stay in touch as you continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn more about chloramine and PFAS and
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is a constantly evolving,
uh, industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still learning so much about water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't figured it all out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it's just one thing to be
comfortable in drinking water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we start growing plants,
all of the different things we've
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered about water and how much we
still don't know about its effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on, on what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As, as horticultural, you know,
as, as growers in our, our spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of fun.
