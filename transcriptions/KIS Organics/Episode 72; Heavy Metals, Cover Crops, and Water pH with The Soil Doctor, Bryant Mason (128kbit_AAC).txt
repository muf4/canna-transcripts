[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryant is a certified crop advisor who
specializes in organic cannabis nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has spent the last three years working
to combine precision laboratory techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: with data science in an effort to unravel
the complexities of cannabis soil and crop
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with his work on soilless media,
he also helps outdoor cultivators around
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: with nutrient management and cover
cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to do soil testing or
help interpreting a soil test,
[SPEAKER_02]: his website is www.soiledoctorconsulting

[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Bryant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know we've talked a lot off air
and had a lot of long conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chatting with you about soil and
soil science, so I'm really glad to have
[SPEAKER_02]: you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start off telling the listeners a
little bit about your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a certified crop advisor through the
American Association of Agronomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which essentially means that I went
through a series of tests to get
[SPEAKER_00]: certified, and I work with a number of
different growers on soil and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I specialize specifically on nutrient
management and even more than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a number of different crops,
but primarily cannabis and primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really enjoyed listening to your
show, and I think we always have a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about, so I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people who haven't checked out
Bryant's Instagram, it's at soil
[SPEAKER_02]: underscore doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always putting up new videos,
walking around in cool places,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about organic matter or irrigation
or numerous topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to recommend that real quick for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive in talking about something you
and I have talked a little bit about is
[SPEAKER_02]: this theory of soil testing with soilless
media versus actual real topsoil and what
[SPEAKER_02]: those differences are, because they're
quite different media with quite different
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to take that away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most fascinating topics
to me, because as I've worked more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more with cannabis production over the
last several years, I've noticed that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the traditional soil science
developed in topsoil, topsoil being real
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral soil composed of sand,
silt, and clay just doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major differences that I think about
are the homogenous nature of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For eons, it's been mixed, and soilless
media isn't necessarily like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has larger particle sizes that are not
quite as homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the underlying difference is that
there isn't any clay in a soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the CEC on a soil test,
for example, it's at the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity that measures the soil's ability
to hold nutrients on the clay colloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be interpreted differently,
as does the organic matter number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really going down the list, you really
have to look at the soil chemistry quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit differently in a soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other obvious difference that most
people understand is the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much more pore space in the
soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drains more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, because there's no clay colloid
and because of that high drainage ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't necessarily hold nutrients as
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of nutrient holding capacity
tends to come through organic matter as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to mineral colloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a handful of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less, I think about solubility a
lot in a soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think less about balancing the mineral
colloid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to hear your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to back up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we are looking and evaluating a soil,
for example, or a soilless media,
[SPEAKER_02]: traditionally with soil, we're talking
about three things, at least in my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may correct me based on your agronomy
background, but I think of the physical
[SPEAKER_02]: properties of the soil, which would be
sand, silt, clay, or that air-to-water
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio I think about the biological
properties of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the microorganisms,
soil food website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think about the mineral aspects of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of nutrition and fertility does
that soil hold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those three things form a mental triangle
for me when I'm evaluating or trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at what the limiting factor of growth
might be in a given soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about how these
pillars work together in forming our
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that mental triangle is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that all the time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The connection between the two is what's
most fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I think about it is that the biology
is critical for primarily nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really how I think about the
connection between chemistry and biology
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the biology is mineralizing or
releasing nutrients from the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of mechanisms in which it
does that and providing nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also connected to the physical
characteristics of the soil because the
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat, as we all know, soil is an
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you zoomed in, you would see pore,
space, and a number of different almost
[SPEAKER_00]: ...
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine the favelas, packed in habitat
where biology lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas exchange, the water exchange,
all of that, the pH, the redox,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that chemistry and all of those
physical characteristics will define the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological community in a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about the three
characteristics of soil that you
[SPEAKER_00]: described, I really think about,
well, what is it that we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: managing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single thing you do to a soil will
change all three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an agronomist, I think about how can we
measure and manage the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and the chemical
characteristics primarily, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately dictate that biological
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of cannabis growers are
also very passionate about managing the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological elements of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to your point, they're all
critically important and all highly
[SPEAKER_00]: interrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should all be considered with every
single biological decision that we make,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's an input decision or a
tillage decision or a cover cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to touch on the biological,
well, first off, I want to say we seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: have different camps within some of the
more extreme agronomy theories where you
[SPEAKER_02]: have people who've just focused solely on
biology and then you have people to focus
[SPEAKER_02]: solely on mineral balancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you don't really see that so much
on the sand silk clay side, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because they are all so
interrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that, when you were talking,
it made me think about is the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: when we think about biology and our soils,
that soil is so diverse in any given soil
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's pockets of anaerobic
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: pH is not constant throughout the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different pockets with different
pH throughout there that's created by the
[SPEAKER_02]: biology, by that air-water exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glomalin is probably the most known one to
me in terms of the bacteria forming glues
[SPEAKER_02]: and soil aggregates and fungi doing the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really complex process.
[SPEAKER_02]: To think that we fully understand it or
even can really manage it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: biological side, I think it might be a
little bit arrogant on our ends based on
[SPEAKER_02]: our current level of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am constantly devouring content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that where I've landed is that
because of the infinite complexity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil biology that's primarily dictated
long-term, all the science shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: community composition is determined
long-term by physical and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose to focus on optimizing and
managing those, and I let the biology fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some really, really
exciting new scientific techniques that
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking at soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome sequencing is the one that comes to
mind, but there's a number of other PLFA
[SPEAKER_00]: and a number of other testing techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with those is that the science
and the scientists that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: innovating in these areas don't
necessarily have targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they're striving
towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it can be measured,
it can't necessarily be managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a number of people would disagree
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: By all means, I think every approach that
is biologically forward is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at the science and when I look
at how to make big management decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to believe that we should be doing
things that promote biological activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and diversity and avoid those things that
don't and otherwise let nature go through
[SPEAKER_00]: that complex process to define what that
biological profile looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, we've come a long way
with biostimulants just in the last few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's been a lot of research and
work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of an exciting new field and a
lot of ways to replace this whole chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset that we had coming out of World
War II.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would essentially be applying a very
specific set of microbes to create a very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific interaction in the soil with
positive outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that fit into your thoughts on
all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really thrilled and excited about the
possibility of biostimulants that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily active microbials,
but can also be enzymes or various
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial exudates that produce a positive
plant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a tremendous opportunity
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it as a way to improve terpene
profile and just general genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression aside from yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really getting to those quality
characteristics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say though that biostimulants can't
replace nutrition because at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, plants need nutrients to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these biostimulants aren't
providing enough quantity of actual
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for the metabolic function of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an amazing addition to a
nutritional program, but they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily replace it unless that soil
already has sufficient and balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition to feed a heavy-feeding cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't create elements out of thin
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be accessible to the
microorganisms as in present in order for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to have any real effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an important thing because
the argument I've heard from some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people on the biological side would be
that all soils have sufficient mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about getting the microorganisms
correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I don't necessarily subscribe to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts in regards to
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that essentially a rebuttal to this
idea of mineralization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not in the soil with media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain top soils, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, there's hundreds or even a
thousand harvests theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to keep in mind that we
are mining nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is uptaking a tremendous amount
of nutrients and we're exporting that off
[SPEAKER_00]: of our farm to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop after crop, that is depleted and I
think specifically of nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients drop out very,
very quickly when you're yielding really
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy plants of any annual for that matter
or even tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest peaches or apples,
those nutrients need to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced a grower in a
degraded soil or a marginalized soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gotten away with not applying
nutrition season after season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a soil with media, there's just no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantity of nutrients in the soil with
media just isn't enough to sustain round
[SPEAKER_00]: after round after round of heavy cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep in mind too, when we're
applying compost or compost teas,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're increasing nutrient cycling if
they're quality, let's say too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're increasing nutrient cycling,
biological diversity, biological biomass,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're also giving them a little bit of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be the limiting factor of
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not necessarily be all these
microorganisms that are really helping
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're seeing results in marginalized
soils and maybe just a little bit of N
[SPEAKER_02]: too, I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Ted, I think about this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about the great papers that you've
put out through KISS that really are using
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental design to look at these
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this would be an amazing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you would set up the
experiment, but to identify if the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: response to a tea or a K and F ferment,
whatever, is a result of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms or the nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've made teas without falfa and a
number of different pretty nutritious
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The output is a fairly nutrient rich tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, growers report great crop
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't know the function there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the mechanism to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be an amazing study and
something to look at just so we know more
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think knowledge and information
is power, not necessarily to derail a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain school of thought, but rather just
so we have more information to manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when we're talking about plant
health relative to soil health,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to look at what the limiting
factor of growth is for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the physical properties of the
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that some particular mineral that's
either in excess or deficient?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it our watering so that these nutrients
are available?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something in the environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Figuring out what that limiting factor of
growth is, because I say this a lot in the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is something that you're quite
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be really strategic with what
we're applying to our soils and to our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your soil has sufficient nitrogen,
don't put down a nitrogen rich product,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it was that secret sauce that your
buddy used that made his crop turn out
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to help and could
potentially be detrimental, which just
[SPEAKER_02]: leads into this idea of soil testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to add anything to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want to dive a little bit into
soil testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with everything you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think precision is the key to nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about soil testing,
a lot of people, I think, find it
[SPEAKER_02]: daunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandably so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would even say I'm one of those
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I looked into it more and more,
I actually had less faith in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers I was reading in terms of
variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had trouble making actionable
decisions based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where someone like you comes in as
a really helpful area of expertise,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that you can rely on to help
interpret these tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you utilize soil testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How, as a grower, can we become more
comfortable with these tests too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me first just touch on
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's a lot of concern
around the amount of soil that's used when
[SPEAKER_00]: running a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Logan Labs exclusively for the
reason that all soil tests and all soil
[SPEAKER_00]: labs are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stick to the same lab in order
to make sense and in order to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: targets that are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really an apple to oranges
industry, which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan uses a very small sample size,
which sounds concerning when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found is that, and I've looked at
thousands of cannabis oils, is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of the time, the variability
from sample to sample does not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: change the ultimate management decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, growers will send me 10
different tests, maybe a test for every
[SPEAKER_00]: single bed in five different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always variability, sometimes
upwards of 30 parts per million between
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the same pattern always exists
across soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when it comes to top soils and a
lot of soilless media that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous, the variability is tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I worked on hazelnuts in
the Willamette Valley, a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: grower broke his farm into 10 different
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out there all day sampling,
taking extra careful precautions to just
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure my sampling was rigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took multiple samples, aggregated into a
single sample, 10 different zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me literally all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results came back and I was shocked at
how they were almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemistry was almost identical across
all of these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that over and over and over
again to the point where I believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes growers are over sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a common rule of thumb to
break your farm into a bunch of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is most of my recommendations
are almost identical across all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the variability is less of a
concern the more I see this phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've experienced the same thing,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do though?
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought goes to indoor cultivation with
soilless media, or what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: are calling living soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: and crop differences across beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we had 20 beds in a room and
five of them are doing poorly and five of
[SPEAKER_02]: them are doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have people manage in those
situations in regards to testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the cultivars the same in the thought
experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, rarely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say they're probably not in a
realistic facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I help growers get their
soils in a target range where the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of cultivars will do very,
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we all know that there are
significant cultivar differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to address that is to get
your soil in efficiency and balance and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is not perfection, the goal is to
get it toward improving levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to tissue test each individual
cultivar and change your soil targets
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the tissue results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with a number of growers on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back to your question, if I'm seeing
differences, if there's significant
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, what that probably tells me is
that all the soil is out of whack,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certain cultivars are able to handle
that difference a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are showing lower production
or deficiency symptoms are the canaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: the coal mine in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other explanation is that the soil
across that greenhouse isn't homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do in that situation is I
would have the growers sample from the
[SPEAKER_00]: poor areas and the good area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could either do two samples or four
samples if they just want to control for
[SPEAKER_00]: that variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, what I would see from my
experience is that that soil is relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing the same pattern,
but certain cultivars are able to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: that high magnesium or the lower
phosphorus or whatever it may be that's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up in the poor producing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you say that, I'm thinking back
in my head mentally to some of the tests
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that to be fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I'll see variability on is
usually nitrates and pH across when
[SPEAKER_02]: someone will test, let's say, all of their
beds sort of thing individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two things that I find kind
of fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's just due to the genetics in
the bed or maybe their watering habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen thing is extremely hard to
manage both in outdoor food cultivation as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as in cannabis, indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend so much time thinking about
nitrogen management in organic production
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you nailed it with watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overwater one bed just a couple of
times, even one time, your nitrate is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to essentially flush out a
little bit of that nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the most variability between beds I
agree is usually in the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
nitrogen or do you want to dive into
[SPEAKER_02]: water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few thoughts on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's extremely mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think growers should keep in mind that
it's removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the soil at the highest quantity,
nitrogen and potassium are removed in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production in the highest
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a soil, the first thing that's going to
become deficient is going to be nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium, and specifically nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue target for nitrogen is anywhere
from three and a half to five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the leaf tissue, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is also removed upwards in the
three to five percent range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing to keep in mind is
that you really have to have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: replenish nitrogen round after round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you'll start to see issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue with nitrogen is that I see it
kind of like a gas tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan tests for available nitrogen,
which is defined as ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonium will always be low as long as the
organic amendments have fully mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be about less than one or two
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrate number is really the important
one to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that as sort of a gas tank,
but the issue is if you put too much in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to have crop quality issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to call in pests and disease,
fungal pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed a decrease in flavor and
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It messes with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I believe it can produce kind
of a lower density flower quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just causes issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the minute the plant runs out of
nitrogen, so many of the metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: functions stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physiology, the growth, the flower
development, it really is the fuel in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final thing I want to mention is in
soil science, nitrogen is ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not an easy way to get an accurate
portrayal of how much nitrogen you have
[SPEAKER_00]: because that nitrate number is so fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bouncing all over the place all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's the most challenging thing
to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the growers I've seen who get
consistently three pounds per light or
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to measure it,
grams per watt, they are actually running
[SPEAKER_00]: their nitrogen a little bit lower,
but they're feeding soluble amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen through the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows for that quality to remain
really high, but you have to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never run out of nitrogen at any point
in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you can let it draw down latent
flower, but that's an essence that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant still has enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just translocating it from its older
leaves into the parts of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: are still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a stream of consciousness,
but those are my high-level thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question I have based off of ... I'll
use the Malik 3 test to look at nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some tests really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I aim for around 100 to 120 pounds per
acre in that corn range for nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've seen tests double and triple that
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your target with nitrate,
and how do you manage it when it is really
[SPEAKER_02]: high?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned it is so ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you not worry about that as long as
your visual crop response looks good?
[SPEAKER_00]: My nitrogen target changes based on how
long the plants are going to be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a full-term crop or if it's just
for flower, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more, it's transplanted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in veg for one to three weeks,
and then flipped into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think of it as just a flower,
just mentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this, let's just think of it in
flowers, and it's transplanting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil as a flowering soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, and I just want to mention
that pot size matters, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The release rate of whatever nitrogen
matters, but in general, for flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for 150 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar to you, but to just make it
more complicated, I do some complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: math on the pounds per acre, because we're
converting something that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic, topsoil in nature, and putting
it into a soilless media in cubic yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use that metric, but it's
adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I'm looking for about 75 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good level going into
flower, and then any remaining nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: you may need, you can always apply later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal to me is to end it down near 20
or 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too low, so it's completely deficient,
but not too high where it's affecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned nitrogen in an amino acid
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of amendments or products are
you finding people are using effectively
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that nitrogen in small doses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say soluble amino acids derived
from soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite, that's my go-to,
is a soluble soybean meal amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people use aminos from
fish, which I'm sure are just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an opinion or preference one
way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the idea being that in the plant,
nitrate is converted into complete
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins in the leaves through a pathway
called the nitrate reductase pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting thing to Google
if you find it on Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows the complexity of plant
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires molybdenum as the enzyme
cofactor that converts nitrate into
[SPEAKER_00]: complete protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process metabolically is extremely
taxing on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that it takes upwards of 18% of
the plant's total photosynthetic energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert nitrate into complete protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory behind amino acids is that you
are giving the plant the building blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: for protein, and therefore it doesn't have
to convert that nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves a tremendous amount of energy,
let's just say 18%, just for
[SPEAKER_00]: oversimplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant then has 18% more energy to
devote or allocate toward other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth functions or root exudation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think 18% more energy every single
day, I would do anything for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of product are you finding make
this soy-based amino acid?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, is there a particular product or
brand that you could throw out there for
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners to maybe check out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate naming brands because I try to be
product agnostic, but I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agmino is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one, Fertinitro, that's a great
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another good one, Grower's Secret
N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three that come to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been using a product called
MycoChum from Plant Success because it has
[SPEAKER_02]: N and K specifically, but I am totally
open to, maybe that's something I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: look into, is offering to our customers on
Kiss Organics is a soy-based one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, so we talked about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to talk about potassium or do
you want to dive into water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about potassium real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't resist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is an interesting one because
... Let me connect it to nitrogen really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of products, there's a
number of amendments, but at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, I believe that compost is the
winner when it comes to a slow-releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: source of both nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best organic growers were using
compost well before I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick with soilless media and cannabis
production is all compost is so different
[SPEAKER_00]: in quality and so different in nutrient
profile and it has such a differing amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of sodium and salt that it's really easy
to overdo compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_00]: My belief is that once you get your base
mix, once you build your soil or buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: kids' soil or whatever it may be,
the trick there is to apply just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of compost every single season or
every single round because compost doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: release all of its nutrition in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues to release it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like saving money every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting a little bit more money in
the bank account that's going to spit out
[SPEAKER_00]: dividends or interest every single year
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really mitigates the nitrogen and
potassium mining that I referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the only good source of
potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's potassium sulfate, there's
potassium silicate, there's green sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's wood ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of K&F guys will use
sunflower ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like ash because it concentrates
all salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it has high potassium,
you bring in a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium sulfate and potassium silicate,
those are both highly soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soluble at about 420 grams per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to gypsum, that's only,
let's say, 8 grams per gallon in its
[SPEAKER_00]: solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solubility is great because you can
feed it and you can dissolve it in water
[SPEAKER_00]: and drench it, let's say, through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means that it's soluble in the
soil and that it can leach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains in the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily cling to the
organic complexes like, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium, not only is the plant uptaking
it, a lot of it, through the entire plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stage, but it's also very leachable
in the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that potassium is an interesting
one because it's, and this isn't new to
[SPEAKER_00]: most folks, but it's incredibly important
for flour development, flour sizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flour density and hardness, as people like
to refer to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Density.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get that weight on your
flour, you need sufficient potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of yield depends on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard one to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
I don't believe you want to push too much
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium in and veg because potassium and
calcium are highly antagonistic in both
[SPEAKER_00]: their uptake and their translocation
around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found, and from talking to really
good growers, again, who are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently high yields, is that you
really want to push calcium in veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: load your plant with calcium because that
sets you up for a really good harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to flip the script in flour
and just make sure you're getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a balancing act between those two
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the key is it makes it easier to
either have a lot of fresh compost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that's constantly releasing potassium
or you really do want to feed potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my general rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leaves us with sort of potassium
sulfate or potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium silicate would be the egg sil,
16H.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people know Dyna-Gro protect,
which is essentially a bottled watered
[SPEAKER_02]: version of that potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium silicate is allowed for use in
organic production as I believe as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct, Suzanne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne would kill me for not knowing this
offhand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe it's allowed to be used as
a fertility management tool, though I
[SPEAKER_02]: think many folks do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking potassium silicate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only recently started recommending it
because so many people are using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always used potassium sulfate and
I've only recently switched over,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I was not aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can look over that with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fairly confident that that's right,
but people can fact check me on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, the potassium sulfate is
something that I use as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mined product, 50% potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really easy way to get and a very
affordable way to get potassium into your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil when we need to get that little
boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I totally agree with you about
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back and we keep skipping around
water, but you keep bringing up these
[SPEAKER_02]: great topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned, not all compost is the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all has varying levels of minerals,
of heavy metals, of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things of microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing about this process that I
want to highlight that you touched on was
[SPEAKER_02]: every time we harvest a plant,
this is not a closed system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pulling out nutrients and you're
pulling out organic matter and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: compost replaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really helps get that organic matter
fraction back up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're adding back in compost at some
point in time, you may need to add back in
[SPEAKER_02]: aeration or some sort of thing to maintain
that air to water ratio though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want that gas exchange that you
highlighted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to highlight that one more
time, but let's talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said, what is good versus bad compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we evaluate compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a whole podcast,
I know, but let's just do a quick little
[SPEAKER_02]: thing on it and then maybe we can have a
whole podcast on it down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to chime in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing, and I have a lot to say
on compost, but take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: People live running living soil beds that
are on round 20 or 10 even.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is that organic matter is
mineralizing and usually the bulk density
[SPEAKER_00]: goes up in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It especially has more compost added,
to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen one of these beds that
doesn't have worms in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By round 20, I think those beds have
pretty much turned to worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings are magical in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, I really think it's
important to be adding more aggregate
[SPEAKER_00]: because when the bulk density increases of
your soil with media, it really changes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the water holding capacity and
drainage characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you have to adjust your irrigation
technique or increase aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you 100%, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's how I would define a good compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that's indicated in two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is through the ammonium to nitrate
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want lower ammonium compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That usually means that it's fairly
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second way is through the carbon to
nitrogen ratio, which I think may be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing when looking at a
compost's ability to provide nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop and to not immobilize nitrogen
because when the carbon to nitrogen ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: goes over about 18 to 22 to one,
right in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a relatively large range,
but my rule of thumb is 18 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's greater than that, you shouldn't
count on any nitrogen release from that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when it's above 20, you could
actually see a nitrogen draw where those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes need nitrogen to break down the
carbon and they steal that nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the first really important
thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that I look at is sodium
and salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the arid west, anywhere where they're
making compost out of high salinity
[SPEAKER_00]: feedstock or the water that they use to
keep the compost moist is high in
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to see salinity building up
in compost, which is going to import a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of negative ions into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: By negative, I don't mean negatively
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean poor for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I look at is the total
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium on a
[SPEAKER_00]: wet basis or as received is how the
compost does look at it, just so I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of if it's on the high hotter end of
things or if it's more of an inert organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter source that may not be providing a
lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, hot nitrogens come from chicken
manure, other poultry manure, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: castings that have been fed, a really rich
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes see really high nitrogen
numbers in different castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to avoid mushroom compost because I
tend to see really high sodium and
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity from mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love manure, so I love manure based
compost, especially cow manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: horse manure, goat, sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ungulate like that usually has a
really good manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't provide a lot of nutrition,
but again, it's giving a lot of that slow
[SPEAKER_00]: release organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final thing is a fungal rich compost
from what I've heard and read is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called the Johnson-Sue
Bioreactor that I think your listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: should check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple, self-sufficient way to
produce a really high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly fungal and very well broken down
and aged compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you touched on it right at the
beginning, well aged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing beats time and Mother Nature when
it comes to making compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the majority of commercial compost
that we see are just produced way too
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly to optimize plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably my biggest takeaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your own compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Static composting is by far the best way
to make high quality compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thermally compost it first, kill off the
pathogens, weed seeds, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the one thing I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I would say to all of that
would be I haven't had the best experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with cow manure-based composts relative to
some of the other manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I much prefer horse manure over cow
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I think manure-based composts
are wonderful if properly managed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find the fertility on cow manure compost
to be pretty poor in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people say add compost, I don't think
that really captures what you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of just on a forum,
for example, people say add earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings, add compost, but that doesn't
take into account the quality or the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient levels or the biological activity
and whatever it is they're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: adding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of goes full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my biggest issue with recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil recipes are garbage in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're mixing coots mix, for example,
the compost you'd be applying in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Willamette Valley versus the compost you'd
be applying in Oklahoma or Nevada or
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is so it's the difference between
eating a salad and eating McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just night and day in terms of what
you're contributing to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take the same soil recipe and
create a nearly ideal soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the same recipe, you can create
something that's complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Coot himself has said multiple times,
you're not making coot mix because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have my earthworm castings,
which would speak exactly to what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good point when people have
successes or failures with recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's exactly true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the only other thing I would add
is that I like to do some level of
[SPEAKER_02]: biological testing, even if that's
qualitative.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look at a compost, I want to see
under a microscope what sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganism activity I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I see good diversity in terms of the
morphology of organisms I'm seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I getting good biomass?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like to look at as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of nematodes am I seeing in the
mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you on the compost thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think everyone has to have a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the least useful of all the
agronomic tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I'm saying that on the
air, but I really do believe that when
[SPEAKER_02]: people ask me buy a microscope,
I'm like, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a dino light first or some way to look
for pests or get a dissolved oxygen meter
[SPEAKER_02]: or a pH pen or these other things first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to start getting a
microscope, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: People might eat you up for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend a pulse meter, and I'd also
recommend an aerometer, a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think my two favorite tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have some more advanced tools,
but if I were to recommend my two favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: for the average grower, it would be a
pulse meter and a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're going to do a lot of
soil testing too, having just a very
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable soil sampler I think is really
an easy buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing is I have a really
expensive probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it all the time, of course,
but it doesn't necessarily always jab into
[SPEAKER_00]: soil media that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I end up using a trowel
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do like a trowel for soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's talk about water because it's
something that, frankly, I don't have as
[SPEAKER_02]: much experience and knowledge with as I
would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always tell people to test their water
so we can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about a water
test and what we should look in evaluating
[SPEAKER_02]: water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water chemistry is more complicated
than most people think, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between pH, bicarbonate,
and alkalinity, which are three different
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics on a water test that are all very
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH of your water is simply a
function of the... The pH by definition is
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydrogen ion concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that contributes hydrogen ions
is... I'm going to lower your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that consumes them is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of, I don't know,
water snake oil out there, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: good to remember that that's the
fundamental, the hydrogen ion
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to... I look at a lot of
water tests and the more important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at than pH is alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alkalinity is slightly different in
definition than pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it says is it's saying how much acid
would it take to lower the pH or how
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to pH changes your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why that's important is because when
your water enters your soil, the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buffer the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: People usually, most cannabis growers
understand that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have low alkalinity,
the water is going to be buffered really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter if your pH is 8.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your alkalinity is super, super low,
then as soon as it hits the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to revert to whatever the soil
pH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you could also have a pH of let's
say 6.9, but a really high alkalinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that when that water enters
the soil, it's not going to be buffered
[SPEAKER_00]: down as easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in fact going to change the soil
pH over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's important to understand is that
if you have high alkalinity, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: better indicator that you should adjust
your pH than if you just have high pH
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I want to
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the third metric that I mentioned was
bicarbonates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bicarbonates lead to high alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually when water runs through the
parent material of a soil, it picks up
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate like calcium carbonate or
magnesium carbonate, also referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: free lime, and it will go into the
solution and convert into bicarbonate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which leads to a higher alkalinity and a
higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're doing when you add acid to
an irrigation water is you're dissociating
[SPEAKER_00]: the bicarbonate and therefore lowering the
alkalinity and lowering the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's so complicated, and it's
taken me years to really have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental grasp of it, but I hope that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're looking at this test in
terms of bicarbonate levels, how do we
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust and how concerning is that,
I guess, in evaluating a water for
[SPEAKER_02]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend that when total alkalinity
goes above about 120 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you should really consider
applying acid to your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a relatively arbitrary number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go up to 140 or 150,
but usually when the alkalinity is over
[SPEAKER_00]: about 150, 160, you should definitely
consider acidifying your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alternative would be to run your soil
pH a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you submit a saturated taste test
with your irrigation water, that's looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the combination of your water with your
soil, and that's the pH you should really
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can definitely have a high pH
water with high alkalinity and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: a low pH soil, but together they combine
and your pH is really right in range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I mean by consider
acidifying over 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to, but you should start
thinking about how to change your
[SPEAKER_00]: management to make sure your soil solution
pH is optimized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying when you go to Logan with
a complete soil test, send them a sample
[SPEAKER_02]: of your water, too, so that when they run
that saturated paste portion, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: where they, again, correct me if I get
wrong, they take your soil and essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolve it in, they'll use distilled,
I think, I believe, or fairly neutral
[SPEAKER_02]: water, unless you send them your
irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they do with your irrigation water,
it's essentially what ions come out or
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients come out into that liquid
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a more accurate representation
of what your plant roots are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every grower who goes on my website
orders a soil audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them the forms to send in the Logan
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that they send their four
ounces of their irrigation water for Logan
[SPEAKER_00]: to run the test with their irrigation
water for that exact reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't recommend that if you have
super clean water like RO or even most
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to significantly change
the soil solution enough to justify having
[SPEAKER_00]: to go find a four ounce bottle and ship in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about acids, it's
typically the lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the tests I see are dealing with
high pH alkalinity, bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three that I'm aware of,
sulfuric, phosphoric, and citric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's pros and cons to all
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to just stick to phosphoric because
citric just doesn't have much buffering
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll fluctuate pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really seem to change the soil
pH over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sulfuric I avoid because there's
a lot of reports that damages soil
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms significantly more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, what are your thoughts on
ways of lowering pH effectively and as
[SPEAKER_02]: organically as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so technically in certified organic
production, you can only use citric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use phosphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's only if you're a veggie
producer that has to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with citric acid, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any organic acid for that matter,
for one thing, if you acidify your water
[SPEAKER_00]: and come back a day later, it'll just jump
right back up because my understanding is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in biology, there's bacteria that
consume the conjugate base and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry that I couldn't really explain
on this podcast without reviewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, to your point, it's not as
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also more expensive and it's just not
as powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to apply it so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphoric is great because you're
actually getting soluble phosphorous and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis just loves phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside of that is that in topsoil
and in research, which again may not apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to soilless media, but high soluble
phosphorous will decrease mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization because one of the primary
ecological functions of mycorrhizal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: solubilize phosphorous and deliver
phosphorous to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: New research also shows that it does
deliver nitrogen and other compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm getting sidetracked here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphoric, I think is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides soluble phosphorous and it's
much more powerful and it doesn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: to what you're saying, Pat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfuric, I recommend for orchardists who
have a high pH soil in a calcareous region
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're changing the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to reduce the pH of
that soil because there's just so much
[SPEAKER_00]: free line that you just take lifetimes of
huge sulfur applications, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: change the soil solution pH, which is
really where I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on the solution both in all my
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can install a sulfur burner,
which essentially uses sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shoots sulfur into the water,
drops pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used sulfuric acid specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have come to me with that
same concern that you just expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: around hurting biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that sulfur can be used as a
fungicide and a biological suppressant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't seen a lot of evidence or
research that sulfur decreases biological
[SPEAKER_00]: community composition, biomass activity
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally open to learn and be schooled
on that, but I think that's one assumption
[SPEAKER_00]: that we should all question and just make
sure that we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following the research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I will say that I've been working
with some facilities that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: battling high pH in their soils and the
applications of agricultural sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every cycle in low doses has successfully
lowered the pH over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we haven't been measuring soil
biology effectively, what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of plant growth and plant's response
is increased yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hypothesis on this is as our pH drops
into a more optimal range for that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's easier for the plant to access
nutrients, thereby allowing it to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you talked about with the amino
acids, it allows the plant to receive
[SPEAKER_02]: those nutrients in an easier form or with
less work so that it's able to put more
[SPEAKER_02]: energy into its overall biomass and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pH is, again, I think
everyone knows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important and I would choose to
fix my pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to keep in mind that
there was a 2020 study that happened this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a meta-analysis that analyzed over
1200 experiments that examined soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial diversity, which is a very
specific metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not examining microbial community
composition or community activity or
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's diversity specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It found that the number of species or the
species diversity is most explained by a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, pH is the driving factor behind
species diversity in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, may not apply to soilless media,
may not apply to these systems where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly applying teas and ferments and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that if we get
the right pH in the long term,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to dictate diversity more
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had a quick cough there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned down my mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I said something.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying not to cough on air,
but it's like I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're starting to run long here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two more topics that I wanted
to cover in this podcast really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be heavy metals and then cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing a lot of, not a lot,
I don't want to exaggerate the issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm seeing people fail for heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically arsenic, I've also seen lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we manage that most effectively in
soils in terms of our input as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: what other outside sources of
contamination do we need to be concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: of, primarily thinking of water and other
metals in our building?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer to the second part
of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suspect it's coming from most
people's water unless they're using some
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the sources in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I can talk to inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been doing a lot of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found and sourced heavy metal tests
from a number of different brands of soft
[SPEAKER_00]: rock phosphate, kelp meal, poultry
products, alfalfa, caranja, soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: neem, blood, and on and on down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to source numbers for
arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I'm releasing all this in an
online course that I am launching called
[SPEAKER_00]: Become a Cannabis Soil Expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share it with you after the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm finding is that there are certain
product categories that are consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: high in certain heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more, barium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For arsenic, there's a whole bunch of
learning here and there's a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that I could mention to stay away
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're failing for arsenic,
the number one thing to look at is your
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it at that for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to talk about other specific
heavy metals, we can go through the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that consistently there's a
number of kelp meals that are really low
[SPEAKER_00]: and a number that are really high when it
comes to arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other sources of arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain alfalfa products,
there's a bit of arsenic that comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: through different rock dust as well as a
couple different brands of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the categories that are going to
bring in the most arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in general, people have to realize
when you're using organic soils or organic
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments, there will be low levels of
arsenic naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think trying to completely avoid them
would be quite challenging using strictly
[SPEAKER_02]: organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing what those levels are and making
sure we're not doing anything to really
[SPEAKER_02]: increase them I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding genetics plays a huge role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivars just pull up heavy metals
like crazy and other ones could seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: care less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two genetics in the same room can have
significantly different heavy metal
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just from the testing I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk about water, my thought is
primarily with people who are using RO
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water wants to bond with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have it like that and it's
strictly just H2O, I think that you're at
[SPEAKER_02]: higher risk of it coming in contact with
metals and then stripping those metals of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in a reservoir having an
irrigation pump, for example, could be a
[SPEAKER_02]: risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plumbing in your facility might be
able to strip lead out of that depending
[SPEAKER_02]: on the type of plumbing that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was getting at in regards to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife uses a Berkey filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a double charcoal filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She puts our water through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't love that because I don't
want a water that's super stripped of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like minerals in my water for
the same reason you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any basis for that other than
the idea that that water may be stripping
[SPEAKER_00]: my stomach or my body of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I want to clarify on that kelp
meal comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying don't use kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying don't use these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people to misinterpret that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying if you're failing for something
and you're using large quantities of kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, you should just consider going with
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say don't freak out about anything
unless you're actually failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be misinterpreted there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about heavy metals in soils,
one of the questions I get that I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: had a chance to research yet is,
are there any good cover crops someone
[SPEAKER_02]: could run to pull heavy metals out of the
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to throw out all your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you amend that quickly with a
potential cover crop that might pull out
[SPEAKER_02]: in its biomass the arsenic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any particular crop you're aware
of that would be really effective at this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I'm not aware of anything for
specific metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could dive into my folder of extensive
resources that I can try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thought I have is grasses are usually
bioaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with growers on cropping out
excess phosphorus, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: with grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, potassium with grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sad thing is hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most wonderful bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, to your point, a lot of
cultivars are going to be really good at
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously not the right answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of specific species that
would do a better job.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put you on the spot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we started talking a little bit
about cover crops, I put up a video this
[SPEAKER_02]: past week on my thoughts on the use of
cover crops in indoor commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, specific to controlled
environment agriculture, or specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying not to use cover crops if
you're in a tent or you have a small grow
[SPEAKER_02]: to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about on scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the pros and cons to
cover crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's talk about all their benefits in
an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about maybe in an
uncontrolled greenhouse or in a field,
[SPEAKER_02]: why do we want to use cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the purpose of cover crops is
very context-specific outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what comes to mind is biomass
production, weed suppression, and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water conservation and water
filtration and soil biological promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually outdoors, I'm thinking about
how to build organic matter, how to build
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen stocks, and how to suppress weed
as the three primary benefits of cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's pollinator benefits and
benefits to attracting predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole number of benefits,
and I'm sure I'm missing several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I can just jump over to that
inward question really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that anyone who's putting time
toward mastering the art of cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping, that is time well spent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I don't see a severe
disadvantage to people who are really
[SPEAKER_00]: innovating in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I tend to agree with you,
Tad, that the possibilities of increased
[SPEAKER_00]: pest populations in a cover crop indoors
probably outweigh the possible benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would get from the things that I
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really laudable that a
number of cannabis growers and really most
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farmers are trying to model
agroecosystems after nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to remember that when we're in
an indoor environment, we've already sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of disconnected in such a way that we
can't perfectly replicate nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under high-intensity lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the same predatory insect
populations, airflow, temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, pest populations can
really get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that personally,
I would try to control that variable by
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating multi-species cover crops
inside and even single-species cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I have one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have one more thing I want to
talk about when it comes to blends versus
[SPEAKER_00]: single-species if you're open to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to touch on that and
just highlight that I have no issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that running trap plants,
running indicator plants, running banker
[SPEAKER_02]: plants all make a ton of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not opposed to having other types
of plants in your facility, just not maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: using them as a cover crop necessarily,
but in a separate space or container in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, I think it's great that
people are innovating in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, my big concern, like you said,
is pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also labor management.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're on scale and we have to think
the number of times that we literally
[SPEAKER_02]: touch or prune a plant because of the
scale, I think it adds a whole other
[SPEAKER_02]: variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing is really,
I think, the last thing is sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: failing on my part in terms of trying to
understand fertility management when we
[SPEAKER_02]: add in a diversity of cover crop species.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's enough challenges around
fertility management when we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about living soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one more variable that makes it
even harder for me to really wrap my brain
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thing would be,
I like to till the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to re-amend, I want to get my
nutrients directly down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere so that I know the plant has
what it needs for its next flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, if we're talking about flowering in
beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have a cover crop,
when you have a heavy mulch, it makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: really challenging to try and re-amend
that soil in that manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to say, like outdoors,
I'm a big proponent of no-till,
[SPEAKER_02]: big proponent of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all the reasons that you listed,
I think they're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm not as convinced as of today,
as of the recording of this podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: that all of these concepts necessarily
translate to controlled environment
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture on scale, indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's, well, yeah,
I know I have so many thoughts and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so well said, Pat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start asking questions,
innocence is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that in so many ways where
I have a general sense of how I
[SPEAKER_00]: idealistically want to create
agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more that I learn, the more
nuanced and context there is that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always allow it perfect application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the general mindset of cover
crops is so wonderful and diverse cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to scale and production,
there's trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, I mean, I totally
understand the benefits of no-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in outdoor soil, topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really is half of the equation
to soil health when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have the same thing in soil with
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis production, I really like to a
really thorough, homogenous amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are the tough decisions
that growers have to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final point on this is there's
multi-species cover crops are really
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another study just came out,
another meta-analysis this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked at cover crop blends versus
single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 27 studies they looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ranked these blends versus their
constituent monoculture species based on
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass production, weed suppression,
water conservation, nitrogen retention,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil biology promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was so interesting was it was
painful, honestly, for me to read the
[SPEAKER_00]: results of this, because I was expecting
the cover crop blends to outperform the
[SPEAKER_00]: single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they actually found that 88% of the
time, there was no difference in those
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a few single-species blends
that did better, a few multi-species
[SPEAKER_00]: blends that did better across these
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just kind of humbling to me to
realize that obviously we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic nature and we're trying to mimic
diversity, but it doesn't always give us
[SPEAKER_00]: the result that we're intending because of
the complexity of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a really fascinating study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the research does show that when
you're cover cropping multi-year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in the three- to five-year time
horizon, grassland studies show that
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-species tend to produce much more
biomass because they're less susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to fungal disease, which will wipe out a
monoculture but when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cover cropping outside, I'm going back to
the basics and coaching growers to just
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it simple, stick with something
that's going to work and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve the underlying production goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes I think we can overthink
things, put together a 35-species blend
[SPEAKER_00]: and not necessarily make our lives any
easier in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's a loquacious way to talk
about cover crops, but hopefully that's
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful insight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe that's something we could put
up on the podcast page for listeners who
[SPEAKER_02]: want to delve a little deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the question sometimes from outdoor
growers of what cover crop should I run?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone has a different environment
that they're growing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually tell them to talk to someone
like yourself, an agronomist, but then I
[SPEAKER_02]: also say, go talk to your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find out what the farmers near you are
using and what they've had successes with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that microclimate is going to be
very different than what I'm dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I like to start when it
comes to cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should be using no-till when we
want to talk about regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture for improving soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the oldest farmer in your area and
ask them what will be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing I want to just add to
this is I love that when I put out that
[SPEAKER_02]: video on Instagram, the majority of people
that even that didn't disagree with me or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe made reaction videos, it was all in
good spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can disagree on these things,
these points.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all organic growers at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all promoting soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all doing what we think is best for
the plant, for our facility, for our
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these decisions that we make don't
make one person smarter or less or more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated than another person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these dialogues are what further
our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's take these conversations
and put them into experimental design and
[SPEAKER_02]: really get to the bottom so we have a firm
answer that supports our conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now that research just does
not exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't say with confidence that what I
shared regarding cover crops is optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give you my logic for why I think it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone could do the same in response.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, we really don't
we can't say conclusively one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important that that
dialogue stays positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that about the majority.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's always going to be trolls,
but I appreciate that about the majority
[SPEAKER_02]: of people that I've interacted with on
these subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we're all just looking for
more information, more knowledge and more
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see those conversations in those
videos, I just think a rock rising tide
[SPEAKER_00]: lifts all ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all in this together trying to
learn more so we can produce better crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and be more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think dialogue is the best way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I support that 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I I really appreciate what you
shared today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to further conversations,
maybe further podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you and I will continue to
chat off air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I've even talked to you and Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've talked about working on some
papers in the future to submit to
[SPEAKER_02]: journals, potentially to to further this
whole process along, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of experiments you
want to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ben and I have a lifetime list as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
