[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Jack Munns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack obtained a bachelor of science in
botany from Colorado State University
[SPEAKER_00]: while working as a lab assistant
facilitating the development of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: markers for invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack then earned a master of science from
Illinois State University where he worked
[SPEAKER_00]: towards increasing vegetable oils and
temperate grasses like corn for biodiesel
[SPEAKER_00]: production using targeted gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has a PhD in botany from the
University of British Columbia during
[SPEAKER_00]: which he worked to unravel the genetic
regulation of nitrogen starvation
[SPEAKER_00]: responses in plants with next-gen
sequencing technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack is now applying his experience in
plant molecular genetics to diagnose
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses in cannabis with three rivers
biotech based out of Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three Rivers Biotech also has a lab in
Ferndale, Washington and a future lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: California later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Jack, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's start off telling listeners a
little about yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I have a doctorate in botany but
I've been working in plant molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics for a little over 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked on a variety of different
projects but I have a really broad skill
[SPEAKER_01]: set in the molecular genetics field and
that's sort of my core competency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've been working on diagnosing
viruses so the most sensitive way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be using genetic diagnostics
such as PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working with Three Rivers Biotech
to develop a platform to help specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis growers to diagnose
viruses and we're sort of expanding our
[SPEAKER_01]: platform to include other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the reason I wanted to have you
on the show today was to talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with viruses that you're seeing
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of simplify the science behind
not just the testing process but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus itself or the viruses I guess I
should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anecdotally a lot of people for
a while there it seems like you know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: go back historically everyone the big
plant problem was spider mites and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: moved on to like broad mites, hemp russet,
cannabis aphids and I'm hearing a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: about viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while everything was being blamed on
TMZ or tobacco mosaic virus but kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: take me through a little bit about viruses
in general and then a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're seeing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah so the first thing is
it's one of those problems that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnose just based on the symptoms alone
so a lot of viruses will have overlapping
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms and so if you go into a field and
you see something with a virus like
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms such as leaf mosaic or sclerosis
or something you can you can easily mix
[SPEAKER_01]: them up just on a visual diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to rely on molecular diagnostics
which then sort of is part of the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why it's taken a while to catch up in the
cannabis field specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not having sort of the academic
researchers do some of the basic research
[SPEAKER_01]: to figure out what viruses might be out
there has sort of hampered our knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's been in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are some reports to go back
and hemp to the early 70s and then
[SPEAKER_01]: recently there's a big pickup in that but
I do expect there will be more viruses on
[SPEAKER_01]: the horizon that are found in cannabis as
researchers are able to open the door to
[SPEAKER_01]: that now with the legalization and
regulations being a little easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned TMV a lot of times gets
blamed and I think so in hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually been found to be symptomless
regarding morphological features so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: back in 1970 the paper by Paulson et al
who basically infected hemp with a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of common viruses and then basically
studied to see if hemp displayed any
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms and they found that while TMV
could infect the cannabis plant it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually cause any obvious morphological
symptoms and so they could then spread the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus but there weren't any major
phenotypes associated with or pathogenesis
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with TMV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I think deserves a
little bit further study.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a plant could be symptomless
morphologically but may have changes in
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the reasons this has
sort of become so prominent recently in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis specifically is the findings of
things like hoplite and viroid which is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty widespread and we're seeing a lot
of that in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of the main thing we diagnose
but then there's a lot of common viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: that are known across agricultural
platforms worldwide that have become,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are able to infect cannabis and cause
symptom infections such as leaf mosaics,
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorosis, necrosis, dwarfing of the plant
and abnormal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely a growing field for
cannabis and it's definitely a resource
[SPEAKER_01]: now that we have tools that we've
developed here and then there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: tools available out in the community for
growers to begin actually figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not they're dealing with
something that is virus related and so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're often introduced to facilities via
something like AFIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of the initial infection but
most commonly they're spread through
[SPEAKER_01]: clonal propagation and pruning that's just
not been, sterilization standards maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: are a little lax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically they're spread via mechanical
transmission from one facility to another
[SPEAKER_01]: off like a clone that came from an
infected mother or something like that or
[SPEAKER_01]: spread within a facility if pruning tools
are not sterilized between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing are the main vectors
are insects or potentially the sharing of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know with TMV in other crops I've
heard it's a big issue and like you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even have a cigarette or be around
anything related to tobacco plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that risk in certain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how common is it for people to spread
it through clothing, touching,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends, highly dependent on the
virus or viroid but TMV is known to be
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps maybe the most stable of all the
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very stable and it can just be
dormant for a very long period of time
[SPEAKER_01]: such as like you said cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not the smoke from cigarettes but
it's the touching of the cigarettes and so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no main vector known for TMV per
se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly by mechanical transmission to
touch based transmission but it can also
[SPEAKER_01]: be spread on seed coats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again it's sort of touching the seed
and so now that seed when it germinates
[SPEAKER_01]: has sort of a reservoir of TMV present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah for TMV it's very stable but then
there's other viruses like cucumber mosaic
[SPEAKER_01]: virus which is very unstable or instable
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cucumber mosaic virus really only lasts
for I think it's that in vitro it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: stable for a matter of minutes to hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's a virus that when it's
transmitted it's what's called
[SPEAKER_01]: non-persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not circulating in the insect but
it's sort of like you know I guess sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like an insect lipstick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if it goes from an infected plant
with cucumber mosaic virus it gets it on
[SPEAKER_01]: its mouth part and then when it moves to
another plant within minutes to hours it
[SPEAKER_01]: can transmit the actually I think it's
within seconds of minutes for cucumber
[SPEAKER_01]: mosaic it can spread it to another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: However there's other viruses that are
more stable and then are persistent or
[SPEAKER_01]: semi-persistent in insects and can either
be in the insect for hours or days or
[SPEAKER_01]: within the insect for months to its entire
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends highly dependent on the
virus so each virus sort of has a
[SPEAKER_01]: different stability but going back to your
original point TMV is very very stable
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had kind of related to this
then is you mentioned which I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting that TMV doesn't
display any morphological or so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeable physical changes or structure
in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you speculate then that most plants
potentially could have TMV?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there seems to be a high overlap
between smoking cigarettes and smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to a certain extent and so would
many plants be exposed?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that was the case then I would
think if it had any effect my thought
[SPEAKER_00]: would be when you did a tissue culture
with plants you would see a improvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: yield or a change in morphological
structure due to the removal of TMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right and yeah so I think it's a little
early so when I say there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: morphological symptoms there's no obvious
you know there's no obvious leaf mosaic
[SPEAKER_01]: that was found with TMV regarding hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was back in the 70s again this is
sort of a burgeoning field of research
[SPEAKER_01]: that it would be wonderful to enlist some
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know quite a few professors that are
working on hemp and cannabis now but yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be great to have like you said a TMV
infected plant that you can measure you
[SPEAKER_01]: know do a COA and check all the
metabolites and sort of get a real fine
[SPEAKER_01]: granular detail of the plant and then cure
the plant the TMV whether you know tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture is probably the best because then
you can have a genetically identical
[SPEAKER_01]: version that you can then compare clean
versus not clean and see if there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: significant differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah the when I say it's not
symptomatic in hemp and cannabis right now
[SPEAKER_01]: the only evidence would be anecdotal
there's no scientific literature that
[SPEAKER_01]: would say that there's a morphological
change from TMV but yeah I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: science it would the science has been
catching up to do regarding some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: those efforts but yeah so TMV and then
going to the other point would a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants be having you know non your
asymptomatic TMV infection circulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far we haven't seen a high incidence of
that in a lot of our testing that's not to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it isn't out there however TMV is
still going to need so while it is
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted by touch it's still going to
need a wound or some sort of entry into
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when insects infect plants it's they
call it a wound and then the virus which
[SPEAKER_01]: is circulating either in their gut or
salivary glands or on their mouth parts is
[SPEAKER_01]: then inserted into that wound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's you know when we have these
spread of infections in facilities it's
[SPEAKER_01]: often because of poor sterilization
practices with pruning tools or leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: cut you know cut plant material that might
have phloem you know sap that's available
[SPEAKER_01]: to then transmit to another wound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as like having TMV circulate
because of that provided you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're if you go for a smoke break
touching a cigarette come back so long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not touching a wound on a plant
that wouldn't necessarily confer an
[SPEAKER_01]: infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah so far we haven't had you know
the overwhelming amount of positives we've
[SPEAKER_01]: had have been for hoplite and thyroid and
not necessarily for so our TMV positives
[SPEAKER_01]: have been relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting so if we if we
table that discussion for now since
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot more on TMV you know you
mentioned hops late hops latent virus a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the symptoms associated with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about a mode of transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had then this seems to be a
good reason not to keep any of your leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: matter or biomass in the room itself and
also potentially avoid having other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be vectors for viruses in the
room too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in cover crops or and just be very
careful with banker plants trap plants
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right yeah so yeah that's a great point
about trap plants and it's a good practice
[SPEAKER_01]: in theory but yeah if you have to be
careful with with the spread of possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know an aphid going from a
trap plant or something like that to one
[SPEAKER_01]: of your crop plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something to be aware of and
regarding just the plant matter you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as clean as you can keep it the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I know you know larger the
facility is the harder it can be to have
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the floors swept routinely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean those get pruned fairly frequently
but anything that has you know phloem sap
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a potential reservoir for a virus
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah so the hop latent so hop latent is
interesting it's not a virus it's a viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: so there is a hop latent virus but that's
not been found to infect cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_01]: specific I think to hops only but the
viroid is they're unique from viruses in
[SPEAKER_01]: that they don't have any protein coding
regions of their genome and their genome
[SPEAKER_01]: is incredibly tiny it's about 1 20th the
size of a plant virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are tiny pieces of RNA that's
circular they don't code for any proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that and so they're sort
of insidious in that regard is that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't they can get into a plant relatively
easily because they're so small so any any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of wound infection they can get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far I don't think that it's primarily
by mechanical injury that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted the hop latent viroid and
viroids in general typically are primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted by mechanical injury so you
know the exchange of phloem sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: However they can be transmitted through
seeds pollen and ovules so hop latent
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids this is the kind of sort of
academic study that I'd love to see done
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis but in hops hop latent viroids
was very minimally transmitted by seed I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's less than about 8% in the
publication that was in 1990 and so hop
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viroids is very low seed
transmission in hops however that said the
[SPEAKER_01]: two ways to get rid of it would be either
either seed or tissue culture and the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: method you should be aware that it's
possible that it's still there so you
[SPEAKER_01]: should just carefully you know proceed
with caution if you're if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and get rid of hop latent viroids via
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as symptoms so the things that
you're looking for are typically going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be stunted or slow growth it's sort of the
main one and so we see a lot of horizontal
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and so the shoot apical merisum
seems to not grow very much and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: this lateral growth and so kind of looks
like depending on how many branches you
[SPEAKER_01]: have sort of like a trident almost you've
got two long branches on the side and one
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle just slow growth it's really
obvious when you compare asymptomatic
[SPEAKER_01]: versus symptomatic copulating next to each
other how slow the growth is and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: horizontal or outward growth so stems are
typically brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note that's really interesting
are you saying that you don't see the same
[SPEAKER_00]: level of like phototropism as in the plant
growing towards the light or apical
[SPEAKER_00]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right it still grows towards the light it
just sort of the lateral branches grow
[SPEAKER_01]: upward and sort of overtake the the
primary you know the shoot apical merisum
[SPEAKER_01]: period apparently so yeah it's sort of
like this yeah sort of a trident is shaped
[SPEAKER_01]: where the middle one is lower than the
outer two but they do still grow towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your secondary branches are growing at
a faster rate I'm picturing like
[SPEAKER_00]: candelabra for people that are listening
because we can't really have visuals here
[SPEAKER_01]: okay all right so I get what you're saying
okay yeah yeah so it's and I mean but
[SPEAKER_01]: overall the plant is just much smaller
than asymptomatic infection too so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty it's pretty apparent when you have
a really symptomatic hoplite infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then leaf symptoms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah so we also get malformed or
chlorotic leaves so sort of leaf chlorosis
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of yellowing or or pale leaves and
then you have stems that are often brittle
[SPEAKER_01]: so they can snap when you brush against
them and then as far as the flower you get
[SPEAKER_01]: very reduced flower mass so the the buds
are going to be smaller and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: usually very really leafy so you get these
loose loose buds that are pain to trim so
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of leaves and then the buds lower
trichomes just sort of lower yield in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow you just described like every symptom
related to anything from watering
[SPEAKER_00]: environment nutrients yeah none of those
things are really specific enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's tricky about a lot of viruses
is they have really overlapping symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them appear to be you know they
could be for all intents and purposes look
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nutrient deficiency so chlorosis of
leaves obviously there's a lot of viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: that have like interveinal chlorosis which
could look like a magnesium deficiency but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not and so one of the things that you
need to consider when you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants is the distribution of the
symptoms uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is to say does your entire crop look
the exact same and then you could maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: pinpoint something like a nutrient
deficiency or is it sort of irregular you
[SPEAKER_01]: know sort of an irregular distribution
where one or two plants are showing the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms whereas the one next to it may
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants won't always show the
symptoms if they have the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we often get asymptomatic hoplite,
viroid infections and so you'll have an
[SPEAKER_01]: asymptomatic plant, extra symptomatic
plant and there'll be a very clear
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the size of the growth of
the plant and then one may have the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorosis whereas the other does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right it can be you know I mean
it's difficult to just walk in and say
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's obviously a virus unless it's
sort of the one plant out of ten and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go like it's probably a virus
because it's only affecting this one plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't see any obvious insect or
pathogens such as a fungi so yeah it's
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure and just to present a contrarian view
there yeah it could also be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially you know what you're saying is
if you see it in one place in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more likely to be a virus than
something that's affecting you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: whole crop and that allows you to guess
maybe it's a it's a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be you know a fan,
your lighting, the way the airflow is
[SPEAKER_00]: through that space so there's a bunch of
things you still have to check off and it
[SPEAKER_00]: all also could be uniform in the sense
that maybe all your plants are infected it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I do as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I want to talk about some of
these other viruses but you really got me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like okay if I see something go
in my room I can't identify it I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: check virus off the list or hops latent in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do like what if we were if we
wanted to work directly with you guys at
[SPEAKER_00]: Three Rivers how would that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so we have a testing kit that we
would send out to you so the testing kit
[SPEAKER_01]: is a test tube, a small test tube filled
with a stabilization buffer so this the
[SPEAKER_01]: vast majority of plant viruses are
single-stranded RNA viruses and so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: I think approximately 75% of known plant
viruses are RNA based.
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA is not a particularly stable molecule
as a I mentioned with your cucumber mosaic
[SPEAKER_01]: virus it's it's very unstable or unstable
so this buffer helps preserve you know any
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses that may be in the sample and so
when you do the sampling the if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomatic tissue you would take a small
clip of that symptomatic tissue so we only
[SPEAKER_01]: need 100 milligrams somewhere between 50
and 100 milligrams so for frame of
[SPEAKER_01]: reference that's roughly the size of a
penny and nickel you know sort of between
[SPEAKER_01]: a penny and a quarter I guess would be the
the range of a leaf that you would need to
[SPEAKER_01]: chop up and the more you're able to chop
it up into little bits the better that the
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization solution can penetrate the
tissue and preserve any any virus that's
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You then put that in the fridge overnight
it allows for the the buffer again the
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization buffer to penetrate the
tissue and preserve any RNA viruses that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be there so then after it's been in
the fridge overnight you would just mail
[SPEAKER_01]: it back to us at which point I would then
run the the PCR so from there I just
[SPEAKER_01]: extract the RNA and we do an RT-PCR to to
test for for the to detect any viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be present in that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have symptomatic tissue but
you are concerned of an infection or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing routine testing just to be
sure you would use young leaf tissue so
[SPEAKER_01]: just an emerging leaf same protocol from
there 50 to 100 milligrams so about a
[SPEAKER_01]: penny to a quarter size of the leaf close
to the petiole is also is also better so
[SPEAKER_01]: these viruses typically travel in the
phloem or the plasma desmata between cells
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're pretty pretty much going where
the nutrients go so oftentimes we find
[SPEAKER_01]: better diagnostics in the young tissue
that said I mean if your symptomatic
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue is an older tissue and that that we
found that works just fine as well so very
[SPEAKER_01]: small amount of tissue because it's from a
leaf and it's destroyed in this buffer so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's very very it's considered hemp for
the purposes of delivery because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: little to no THC and it's a very small
sample so we don't have any any we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: had any trouble there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you touched on the mail aspect
because that was something that I brought
[SPEAKER_00]: up with your colleagues and they mentioned
that the sample is destroyed essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's a biological sample yeah and so
there's no real risk there as far as you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are concerned one question is what
does this sort of thing cost approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a range based on volume but
right yeah so we do offer bulk discounts
[SPEAKER_01]: on orders over 10 but right now for an
individual hop latent test at 75 Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's about a 20% discount for US
customers that's because yeah we are based
[SPEAKER_01]: out of British Columbia out of Vancouver
British Columbia but we have facility a
[SPEAKER_01]: testing facility in Washington and we're
opening up one in California the 75 for
[SPEAKER_01]: the hop latent that's about 60 US if you
want to do the full virus panel which we
[SPEAKER_01]: test for eight viruses currently and
that's expanding sort of we've got our ear
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ground regarding professors working
on finding more viruses and we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into some ourselves that appear to have
virus symptoms but don't appear to be one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the major ones that we have so far so
so it's expanding so we have about eight
[SPEAKER_01]: yes we have eight viruses now on the full
panel and that cost 150 Canadian which is
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 120 US okay and you know how
many samples would I need to send in to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a really good idea of if my plants
have you know a particular virus can I
[SPEAKER_00]: send in one sample if I think I just see
it in one area or if I just want to test
[SPEAKER_00]: the room I realize sending in one sample
of a room that's asymptomatic or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially free isn't really gonna you
know be statistically significant right
[SPEAKER_01]: right so it's it's um so yeah if you have
symptomatic plants obviously the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomatic plants should should be tested
from there typically so statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: significant you'd have to do a lot of
testing to get sort of to a ninety ninety
[SPEAKER_01]: five percent confidence interval you'd
have to do you know significant amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: testing so it's good to sort of identify
where the possible entry points of the
[SPEAKER_01]: infection might be so if you think it came
from a mother like if you if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: really widespread infection it may be
coming from your mother plant so it's good
[SPEAKER_01]: a good place to test to see if you're
spreading it through through propagation
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think it came in from sort of an
aphid infection you know if it's only in
[SPEAKER_01]: one part of the facility plants sort of
spread out around that area are a great
[SPEAKER_01]: place to start so if you have a few
symptomatic plants you can start there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then if you get some if we find positives
you can then expand the search to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out the extent of the infection one thing
that's important to note is that we with a
[SPEAKER_01]: hot blade and thyroid sometimes the virus
titer is too low so the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: the virus is there but it's just too low
to detect with even with the most
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive PCR so we typically recommend
that you do multiple tests to ensure a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative so we have and it's sort of
industry practice to do three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: tests on a negative to ensure that it's
negative and we try and you know you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to spread those to approximately two weeks
apart so some viruses also are more
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent in certain stages of plant
development so that's why we use the
[SPEAKER_01]: younger tissues the younger leaf tissues
it's sort of one of the best testing
[SPEAKER_01]: locations just from from other crops for
development of the plant but so yeah so
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to your question it's gonna
sort of depends on whether you are seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms whether you're just doing a
confirmation to assure your your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility's clean how big your facility is
but obviously wherever you're you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning from your mother stocks those are
probably be your if you have a clean if
[SPEAKER_01]: you think your facility's clean doing
routine testing on those mother stocks is
[SPEAKER_01]: a good idea just to make sure that they
are clean and then if you have something
[SPEAKER_01]: like an aphid infection you should
definitely can you mean it's worth
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about whether or not those aphids
may have brought in a virus and so testing
[SPEAKER_01]: around where the aphid infection was was
first observed things like that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: lastly if you're bringing new genetics in
it's really good practice to quarantine
[SPEAKER_01]: those not put them straight next to your
you know not not put them straight into
[SPEAKER_01]: production but quarantine any new genetics
and test those you know multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: just to make sure that they come up
negative before putting those into
[SPEAKER_01]: production so you don't spread you know
from from from a new new color a new
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that you bring in okay you guys
are primarily testing plants and veg too
[SPEAKER_00]: is that correct I'm sorry was that you're
primarily testing plants that are still in
[SPEAKER_00]: their vegetative state right flower that's
primarily what yeah that's right yeah so
[SPEAKER_01]: this is yeah primarily for vegetative
growth yeah please and please don't try
[SPEAKER_01]: and send us anything from the flower
because yeah the the fact that we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat tissue and tissue by the petiole
it's very little to no THC which makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for for regulatory purposes so yeah
right now we're not doing so we do offer
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond just virus testing we do offer
fungal testing too for PCR identification
[SPEAKER_01]: of certain fungi but we don't we only do
that for vegetative tissues so root root
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and leaf okay yeah I asked that
because you know a lot of these things I
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's really easy to have a healthy
looking veg plant and then a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues seem to crop up in flower
especially late flower that's sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the test for how good of a grower you are
in a lot of ways I feel like so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: are we is it pretty obvious in veg or what
like let's say I noticed an issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower would I then go back to my next
round of clones and that's where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to test and just say okay these these
are done I'm not I'm not trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out if the virus is in these these my
flowering crop for this cycle you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: would you approach that got it yeah so
yeah you approach it one two ways and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that you had mentioned is not a
bad enough so if you think there's a virus
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're you're at the flowering stage
testing your next batch of clones you can
[SPEAKER_01]: start there we can you know we can still
test leaf material from a flowering crop
[SPEAKER_01]: it's yeah I mean I mean because we're
using you know so long as it's leaf you
[SPEAKER_01]: know far far away from the sort of flower
and the THC content should still be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: low but yeah typically we prefer to test
stuff from vegetative plants so the next
[SPEAKER_01]: round of plants would be it would be a
good place to start regarding the
[SPEAKER_01]: infection levels so oftentimes so so for
something like lettuce chlorosis virus
[SPEAKER_01]: they found that the infected the infected
clones develop symptoms much earlier than
[SPEAKER_01]: the originally you know the patient zero
so to speak the the originally infected
[SPEAKER_01]: mother so when you are making the clones
from whatever plant you you suspect as a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus you may actually see the symptoms
earlier in the next in the next batch so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sort of another test I guess you
could say if you did see something
[SPEAKER_01]: virus-like towards the flowering stage you
may end up seeing symptoms earlier in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next growth cycle or or the one following
that so these problems the level of virus
[SPEAKER_01]: typically compounds over time and so yeah
the as far as the testing goes we can test
[SPEAKER_01]: either but you know before you go through
a whole nother girl grows cycle it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably good idea to try and test some of
those those early plants from the next gen
[SPEAKER_00]: okay and and I know your numbers are
probably skewed a little bit because
[SPEAKER_00]: people you know are more likely to reach
out if they if they have an issue but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what approximately what
percentage do you think of the test that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys run come back with some virus or
virus so you're right there are testing
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers are skewed towards people who
think they have symptoms and we are still
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of early in our commercial aspects so
we started talking tests back in March
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been three months in and for growers
sending us in there's only been one time
[SPEAKER_01]: where everything came up negative so we're
typically finding hop latent you know in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of growers and then sitting northwest
regarding how many strains per regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: how many strains per per grower it sort of
varies depending on whether or not they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a worse infection or not and just
sort of by random sampling and sort of our
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling numbers are probably too small to
get any sort of meaningful numbers from
[SPEAKER_01]: there but yeah we are seeing people have
sent us some symptomatic samples all but
[SPEAKER_01]: one so far has come up positive or
something mostly hop latent so it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent that's really interesting that
just that kind of surprises me a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit but yeah yeah really just go to your
point that it's sort of skewed at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point because we are you know mostly
having to reach out with something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic sure but it tells you there's
a level of prevalence that's higher than I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have speculated before talking to
you absolutely at least here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northwest yeah in the northwest and I mean
it's it's known sort of in California to
[SPEAKER_01]: the west coast yes and I mean hop latent
viroid is worldwide I mean it was found
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't remember when it's originally
I'd be even hops I think it was the 70s or
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s but I mean it has a worldwide
distribution I think this reports pop
[SPEAKER_01]: latent positives in cannabis coming from
from New Zealand too so it's and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to start doing some testing for you
know other other areas but it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely there and I mean part of the
problem is that it's not been you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because because cannabis is finally coming
out of out of the shadow so to speak we
[SPEAKER_01]: now have the ability to test for it so
previously you might have just assumed
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of variation due to any number
of other other reasons you know we had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier how it can be tricky to
just walk in and point out a plant say
[SPEAKER_01]: that one has a virus because a lot of
times the symptoms can overlap with other
[SPEAKER_01]: things and also the symptoms of a virus
sometimes don't manifest until an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental stress occurs so you may
just chalk it up to the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: stress and before you know before now when
things are sort of operating in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows it was easier to do that because
you didn't even have the tools to test for
[SPEAKER_01]: the virus so it's not uncommon I mean as
other industries where especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: clonally propagated crop crops until you
until they started looking for viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't realize how big the problem
was so potato and strawberries or
[SPEAKER_01]: industries that had a lot of virus issues
prior to sort of industry-wide testing
[SPEAKER_01]: practices so it is somewhat alarming the
first time you hear it but it's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: all that unsurprising when you sort of
look at sort of the landscape of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and just how sure now how easy
it is to accidentally spread these things
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you know genetics were just sort
of being passed around previously okay
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so if we see in a forum someone
posted a photo which you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook or Instagram and people start
saying oh that's TMB oh that's hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid you can pretty much shut them down
and tell them there's no way they can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly know that from a from a picture
it actually takes genetic testing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: right yeah so you could yeah so molecular
testing so you can also do not for hops
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viroids but for some viruses you
could do protein testing it's less
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive it's called Eliza enzyme-linked
immunodermin I forget all the letters
[SPEAKER_01]: spectroscopy so it's a chlorometric assay
that basically measures the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: protein virus viral protein present in a
sample but essentially you have to send
[SPEAKER_00]: into a lab I guess is what I want to get
out to people so that they don't they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't fall for that I guess in that regard
right there are I mean I think there's one
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom is the leaf mosaicism that one's
pretty I mean there's very few causes of
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of that kind of variegation in a leaf
other than a virus so that one but I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't know which virus because
lots of viruses cause leaf mosaics and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see that we haven't have any
scientific literature to see that in TMZ
[SPEAKER_00]: yet can that be genetic though too or is
that always viral related so there are
[SPEAKER_01]: tropical plants that are naturally
variegated with sort of a mosaic like leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's very rare for that to be you know
as far as far as cannabis goes there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: reports that I know of a specific gene
that if it gets mutated causes mosaicism
[SPEAKER_01]: so and even if there was it would only
affect a small portion of the plant unless
[SPEAKER_01]: it happened very very very very early in
that plant development it also would only
[SPEAKER_01]: affect that one plant so to chalk it up to
genetics is far less likely than the odds
[SPEAKER_01]: of a virus so okay and it's so it's so
unlikely that you can you can almost rule
[SPEAKER_01]: it out but because I don't have any any
scientific information regarding you know
[SPEAKER_01]: genes that cause leaf mosaics and cannabis
I don't want to just sort of rule it out
[SPEAKER_00]: completely but okay another question I had
for you are you have you aware of any
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses that could possibly cause a plant
to hermaphrodite or produce seeds in a
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant it's a great question so I
don't know of any particular virus that
[SPEAKER_01]: would cause that however you know I mean
hermaphroditism that's why it's often
[SPEAKER_01]: triggered by environmental stressors so
you know I mean there's certain strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that are more predisposed predisposed to
hermaphrodite than others sure but still
[SPEAKER_01]: it usually takes an environmental cue to
trigger that so the virus if you had a
[SPEAKER_01]: viral infection it could make the plant
more stressed and result in that but at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point you know I don't have any
scientific data to back that up it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be I think that'll be an interesting area
of study for for some of these academic
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions that are working on cannabis
now yeah so you know you we've talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about hops latent and TMV are
there other viruses that you know you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like or viroids that you think are worth
highlighting yeah I mean so they I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: okay there's a whole group of viruses the
viral aids so far there's no other viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: found in cannabis as of yet there's only
40 roughly 40 viral aids worldwide it's
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of another area sort of growing now
now that people are looking for it with
[SPEAKER_01]: next-gen sequencing but for viruses the
ones that we know are symptomatic would be
[SPEAKER_01]: so alfalfa mosaic virus causes leaf
mosaicism and stunting it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: common virus so you know agriculturally
that one's relevant cucumber mosaic virus
[SPEAKER_01]: is another worldwide distribution virus
very common in the agricultural field
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumber mosaic has been shown to cause
leaf mosaic and dwarfing in cannabis these
[SPEAKER_01]: are you know so alfalfa mosaic and
cannabis or sorry alfalfa mosaic cucumber
[SPEAKER_01]: mosaic both can be transmitted by acid but
then also mechanical transmission and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you know I mean that the
transmission mode is important here
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you have an aphid infection
then you might have you know alfalfa
[SPEAKER_01]: mosaic or cucumber mosaic lettuce
chlorosis virus has been found in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: recently in Israel so far we haven't had
any positives here for lettuce chlorosis
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know of any North American
lettuce chlorosis virus in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: however lettuce chlorosis virus was
originally found in lettuce in California
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're sort of on the lookout for that
one but the different lettuce chlorosis
[SPEAKER_01]: virus the initial infection the natural
infection is by white flies so that's sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of a less common vector for us in the
cannabis field so that one you know unless
[SPEAKER_01]: we we get I think it's in hotter climates
tropical climates that have sort of more
[SPEAKER_01]: white fly problems but in the greenhouse I
don't know if that one's gonna be you know
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't seen it yet so lettuce
chlorosis virus is something that causes
[SPEAKER_01]: stunting and early development but if it's
a later later infection than yellowing
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorosis some necrosis drooping foliage
foliage so just sort of a fat plant
[SPEAKER_01]: there's thinking that in the southwest
they're starting to see more beet curly
[SPEAKER_01]: top virus so this one's a little different
than most plant viruses this one's a DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: based virus not an RNA based one but that
one's transmitted initially by leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: hoppers so that's sort of a specific
vector to sort of tropical regions also so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're hot drier drier areas so the
southwest in the Colorado they have more
[SPEAKER_01]: beet curly top virus than elsewhere to be
curly top is gonna cause symptoms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: again sort of you know similar to most
it's leaf chlorosis leaf curling the
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing of leaves necrosis so yeah a lot
of these viruses have sort of overlapping
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms there's some other major ones the
tobacco streak virus tobacco ring-spot
[SPEAKER_01]: virus they know when to cause symptoms in
cannabis but so far these other viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen a much lower positive rate for
so they haven't been as prevalent but for
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco ring-spot virus that one's
transmitted by nematodes so this will be
[SPEAKER_01]: soil soil-based vector so it's not as
likely in a greenhouse to get a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: infection for tobacco ring-spot it's more
of a outdoor grow problem but again all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these viruses can be transmitted
mechanically so if you're if you're if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not sterilizing your pruning tools
effectively you can transmit or spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: if it already exists in the plant so this
this means if you are working on one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to sterilize your equipment
before moving to you to in the next plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's pretty common practice in right a
lot of horticultural situations and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see carried out as as prevenantly in
cannabis yeah so we definitely encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: strongly encourage our clients and growers
to sort of take on some of those common
[SPEAKER_01]: practices from other agricultural
industries such as that that's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the the lack of sort of sterilization is
probably how some of these things spread
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place and and so doing sort
of due diligence to try and limit the
[SPEAKER_01]: spread that way if you do get a natural
infection which is less common you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the primary mode of infection we're seeing
is mostly just from clonal propagation and
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading it around so the natural
infections seem seem less common and so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing the due diligence of
sterilizing your tools between plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not spreading it limiting the
infection then then you stand a better
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of keeping these things sort of out
of your facility and then once you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: the once they are in your facility and
it's relatively easy to manage once you
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of put in these sort of sterile
practices to avoid spreading it and
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning up your genetics either with TC
or bringing in new clean genetics so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're totally manageable if you do end
up getting a positive which is another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I sort of like to mention with
people who do end up having a positive is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not you know it's not time to panic
it's just it takes some time to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: things up but um it's totally manageable
now in other crops do you see resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to viroids in specific cultivars or
varieties is that a possibility in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis yeah so so for viruses absolutely
there are certain cultivars that may have
[SPEAKER_01]: higher levels of resistance to a natural
infection so the again this is I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: price that is a lot but it's one of those
areas that would be it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really really wonderful to have academic
institutions begin to take up some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: research because it is entirely possible
but it takes a lot of you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: effort and research money to sort of hunt
down any cultivars that might have
[SPEAKER_01]: improved resistance so you can sort of see
that as sort of a fishing expedition where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going out in the world and trying
to find any any cultivar that might have
[SPEAKER_01]: improved resistance to a to a natural
infection the alternative which a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: industries use is genetic you know
modification to to just skip all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing and just improve resistance right
away but obviously there's a lot of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know sort of backlash to that still so
naturally finding strength or resistance I
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's efforts for fungal pathogens
they know of an effort to find resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: for powdery mildew at a academic
institution that's working on that
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially what they do is they they take
a resistant cultivar that doesn't have as
[SPEAKER_01]: frequent of an infection and then they can
do genome-wide association studies so they
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the genome and try and find the
obvious similarities among those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant compared to those that are not
and try and figure out you know gene or
[SPEAKER_01]: gene usually it's multiple genes but try
and find the reasons why you know trait
[SPEAKER_01]: those traits are conferred so it's totally
possible it's sort of a longer-term you
[SPEAKER_01]: know hope and project that definitely
requires sort of the enlistment of some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of academic institutions to do some
of the basic research behind that and to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of speed it along I guess possible
viroids the viruses viruses have you know
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of three steps to their infection you
know the entry to the cell whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: by an insect or other and then releasing
their protein coat which releases the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome into the cell and then replication
of that genome by most often by plant
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins will replicate the genome by you
know just by happenstance some some plant
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses can replicate their own genome but
it's fewer I believe and then from there
[SPEAKER_01]: it's trans it's moving itself from one
cell to another and so those three steps
[SPEAKER_01]: you can you can have traits of the plant
that are able to stop it in its tracks one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the main ways the plants do this is by
silencing the RNA of the virus so so they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a way to recognize double-stranded
RNA and target it for either degradation
[SPEAKER_01]: or prevent it from being translated into a
protein so that's sort of the method
[SPEAKER_01]: that's most commonly employed in genetic
engineering is is improving the silencing
[SPEAKER_01]: specific to a virus so it depends on a
virus and how it's being moved from cell
[SPEAKER_01]: to cell and things like that as to where
you want to stop it in its tracks and how
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be traits that you can select
for viroids a little different because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't they're so tiny the viroids can
enter a small they can virus can travel
[SPEAKER_01]: for cell to cell via sloan and plasma does
not a without the same problems that
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses and curbs they're larger and then
viroids typically reside in the nucleus
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plant host just replicates it
and then it sort of just diffuses from
[SPEAKER_01]: there there are some viroids that exist in
a core blast and are replicated there but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's less of those mostly there in the
nucleus but in order to stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: replication of a viroid you need to have
the RNA silencing mechanism of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tailored to target that viroid and prevent
it from from from being replicated so
[SPEAKER_01]: silence it essentially that's part of
what's called the RNA interference program
[SPEAKER_01]: implants they have proteins that can
specifically recognize certain sequences
[SPEAKER_01]: and they and they can silence them from
being replicated so that's sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: method that you would do that for viroids
and I mean you could do a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering I don't know I have not come
across I could probably look I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you covered it that's getting a
little beyond my academic level so just
[SPEAKER_00]: that just to kind of cover some of the
highlights you know from today just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure people catch it essentially
these viruses do exist in cannabis they
[SPEAKER_00]: are mainly transplant or transported by
pest as a vector and also mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: through like pruners clippers humans
things like that if you want to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested you guys offer those the testing
I'm hoping to work with you guys soon on
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was on the phone with a couple of
your other guys there about getting it set
[SPEAKER_00]: up on our website too so I'm excited about
that to offer that to our our customers if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have a virus or viroid in on your
plants your real options there are to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it to seed which may help but not is not a
foolproof option or do tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a podcast that I also just
recently were recorded with someone from
[SPEAKER_00]: your company as well and that's really the
only surefire way to get a clean plant
[SPEAKER_01]: correct did I cover it yeah yeah you
covered it all and then yeah just
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately there's just no chemical or
or you know there's no vaccines or plants
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah tissue culture and seed are the
only way and some viruses still are
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted via seed so depending on what
it is we can we can work with you there
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the options but yeah that is that's
that's just a bit oh and that this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily something that can be visually
diagnosed in a lot of cases yeah yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: may have a strong you may have some strong
supporting evidence that it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus but you have no idea which one
unless you get it tested because they
[SPEAKER_01]: often have very similar symptoms across
the viruses well how important if we know
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a virus how important is it that
we identify the virus I mean does it
[SPEAKER_01]: really matter at that point isn't the
treatment going to be the same true so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know immediately if you think you have a
virus it's best practice to quarantine
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant so it's not spreading any
infection to neighboring plants however
[SPEAKER_01]: plants will often go asymptomatic so if
you just remove the symptomatic plant it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't necessarily mean you to remove the
entire infection in your facility so
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a positive diagnosis will tell you
a yes it's definitely a virus and then B
[SPEAKER_01]: you should consider doing some testing on
on neighboring or you know other plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: that facility to see if you have
asymptomatic plants there and try and get
[SPEAKER_01]: a handle on the spread so it is still a
valuable tool and then it does give you
[SPEAKER_01]: some information regarding whether or not
you can use seed to get rid of it or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're stuck with PC because some of the
viruses are transmitted via seed yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would add I wouldn't recommend
anyone makes an assumption they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: virus I mean identifying your problem is
something that is the most important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of figuring out your mode of
action or treatment I mean I know with
[SPEAKER_00]: insects Suzanne is drilled into my head
that you really have to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect even know how you're going to
approach you know solving the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: because the treatments vary so much I
would say the same viruses because it
[SPEAKER_00]: could turn out to be some other form of
plant stress that just displays in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks similar enough that you may be
making the wrong assumption it's true it's
[SPEAKER_01]: true and then obviously nutrient
deficiencies are not really something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we expect you know I mean growers usually
have a really strong handle on nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that but um yeah it would
it would be unwise to just assume you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a virus without getting a positive
diagnosis from the lab to then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: give you full information that you can go
forward making the right decisions for
[SPEAKER_00]: your study great well was there anything
else that you want to share regarding you
[SPEAKER_00]: know viruses with our listening audience
no I think that's about it all right well
[SPEAKER_00]: hey I really appreciate your time today I
I learned a lot and enjoyed the phone call
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can talk again soon as you guys
you know discover more in the in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: research here yeah thank you very much for
having me on today I really enjoyed our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation and I really appreciate you
helping to spread the word and I look
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to talking again when when we have
some more information about what the full
[SPEAKER_01]: scope of viruses that are threats the
cannabis are so I look forward to talking
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: that was dr. Jack Munz and you were
