[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast was a fun one for me because
we got to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges around researching cannabis,
how to interpret that research,
[SPEAKER_00]: a recent white paper, comparing single
plant versus communal plant systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, and also announce a new
partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Ben Higgins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben earned his PhD in ecology and
evolutionary biology from the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of California, Santa Cruz, where he
studied functional ecology, organismal
[SPEAKER_00]: morphometrics, and physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the chief research scientist at
Goldleaf Gardens, where he collects data
[SPEAKER_00]: on various topics in coordination with
multiple companies representing all
[SPEAKER_00]: corners of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben works alongside their experienced
staff to refine, research, and develop new
[SPEAKER_00]: methods in organic cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in Olympia, Washington with his
wife and two daughters and loves to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the natural beauty of the area
with them as often as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ben, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's start off by telling listeners
a little bit about you and your background
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you ended up over at Goldleaf
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of like everything else has
been so far in my life, nothing's really
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my background actually comes from
marine-based research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this all kind of started out back
really in my undergrad that I did at
[SPEAKER_01]: Pitzer College.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went abroad to the Great Barrier Reef
and stayed there for five weeks and did a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of independent study work and just
live in the island life and had a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really just got hooked on kind of
studying the natural world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that was my first experience with
it, I kind of just gravitated towards
[SPEAKER_01]: marine life, you know, ichthyology,
so studying fishes and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living still and going to college
still in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coral reefs really weren't,
you know, that available to keep working
[SPEAKER_01]: on when I got home, but kelp forests were
right outside the back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I eventually got linked up with a
principal investigator up at UC Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_01]: and did my dissertation on California
moray eels and really kind of evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: myself into what is kind of described as a
functional ecologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is really it's just
about understanding the organisms in a
[SPEAKER_01]: system and how they interact with that
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I then kind of took a big shift and
moved once I finished my program,
[SPEAKER_01]: moved up here to Olympia and started
working at Goldleaf where it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of a challenge to take
things that were happening kind of on a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger scale underwater and starting to
try to figure out how to apply those to
[SPEAKER_01]: much smaller things that were happening in
the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of looking at a bunch of
different fishes and what they ate and how
[SPEAKER_01]: those species interacted, I started to
kind of shift my focus to the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd find in soils, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So bacteria, all the other small little,
you know, things that are moving around in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and some of the bigger things and
just looking at the trophic interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: there and learning that these are all kind
of dials that you can really kind of turn
[SPEAKER_01]: and then your results aren't necessarily
the species interactions themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the plants as an indicator of those
interactions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your healthy plant is going to be a
great measuring stick of the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening, you know, beneath them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the biology is looking great,
then you're going to see that result as a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the biology under there is imbalanced
or the diversity is low or not so healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you'll see that kind of manifest in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really a cool system to kind of,
you know, moved into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still learning as I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I still love doing this
stuff is I just keep learning and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I kind of ended up at
Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you came into Goldleaf,
you didn't have any experience growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some experience growing plants
beyond just you know, I wanted some
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes for my salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do a years and years ago,
I did a little bit of a an internship at a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery down in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was taking care of things like
coastal live oaks and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of the endemic species down
there, the native species down there and
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing even remotely close to cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think is interesting is with
your background being in science and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific research, it really gave you a
good head start in understanding sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: how to approach data collection in a
facility like Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I would wonder from you is
given your background and as you came into
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole thing, what were you finding
were some of the challenges around data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were some of the metrics that you
found were really important in evaluating
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the business overall or the health
of the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got kind of lucky because of the way
Goldleaf's facility is set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically seven replicate rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to a scientist, replicates are a gold
mine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you can start playing with
different things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different variables and then holding other
variables constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can do that across multiple
different rooms that are identical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start to get a lot of power to
really figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw the Goldleaf
facility, I was like, oh, my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a functioning laboratory as much
as it is a functioning, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told that to Nate Gibbs,
the owner there, and he was very
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in having me come on and try to
turn some of these dials and get down to
[SPEAKER_01]: researching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the challenges are concerned,
this is all coming from the fact that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just spent six years kind of working at my
own pace, you know, kind of investigating
[SPEAKER_01]: any lead that I might find interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just chasing the rabbit down
whichever hole, you know, the questions or
[SPEAKER_01]: the data might lead you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're working within the,
you know, the guidelines of the facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you need to kind of navigate
that a little bit differently,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can't just say like,
well, you know, to answer this question,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to need six years and I don't
know where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a sustainable model to try to
fit within a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a little time to figure out the
sweet spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still am about trying to figure out
kind of not the lowest possible amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: data to analyze, but what would give us
the most amount of statistical power and
[SPEAKER_01]: the shortest amount of time to answer some
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, things that I would like to
do at a, you know, a slower pace or
[SPEAKER_01]: collect as much data as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to maybe truncate a little bit and
maybe collect the same amount of data just
[SPEAKER_01]: in a shorter amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just more repeated measurements
of things rather than a longer duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the harvest cycle itself,
right, will really kind of determine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how much time you have to
collect some of these data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it's just a matter
of, well, that was one round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try this again, maybe with some
different strains or different phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go at it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been, again, a new learning
experience for me to take research and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of find its way through the kind of
the environment, really, that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: functioning, you know, tier two business,
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what you're hinting at is the
fact that you have a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a for-profit business that you're
trying to balance the sort of data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection and research that you're doing
with the fact that you also have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable just to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look at data collection,
and correct me on anything here as we go,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the important thing to keep in
mind is that it's really good to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: what metrics are important to collect,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is to identify what
data do we want to collect and how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate that data to make sure that it's
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're just looking at yield,
there's so many variables that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, that number is useful in seeing how
the business is growing in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cycle, but it's not really telling
us why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell us if it was the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell us if it was the soil or
the nutrient level or the watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really having to isolate each of those
variables in a functioning facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is a real challenge like you're
getting at there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another way to put it would be we're
really, so far I've seen, we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to just investigate the pattern,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like increasing yields would be a really
nice pattern to pick up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get these yields to get bigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get, is it the bud size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more buds per plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a better ratio between dry weight to
wet weight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's all these different ways you
can get at a better yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that gets trickier is when
you're trying to nail down the mechanism,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the biological cause and effect
here for why we're getting the bigger buds
[SPEAKER_01]: or why we're getting more buds per plant
or why we're getting the better ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: between dry weight to wet weight?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the why of it is really kind of,
the drilling down on the actual biological
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism is what can really take you down
a very long, arduous path of hunting down
[SPEAKER_01]: different variables, throwing out ones
that you've tested, and then refining your
[SPEAKER_01]: approach, refining your hypotheses and
going and going and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course everything's got a price,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you find that you do this one thing
and it's like, oh my God, the yields went
[SPEAKER_01]: up, you know, some incredibly
statistically significant amount,
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe it is worth the time and effort
to really try to find that one mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: that's causing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then it's really just kind of
you're trying to change variables to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: a consistent pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of increasing most likely yield,
which like you said, will turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: increased profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things, let's talk about
this first experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wrote this white paper that I got
to assist on from down at Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the paper was really, it was comparing
plants grown in isolated containers versus
[SPEAKER_00]: communal bed systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Goldleaf has been growing in
essentially these raised beds for years
[SPEAKER_00]: now using the same soil over and over and
reamending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you wanted to see what would happen if
we went to containers, because containers
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot easier to move around the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pros and cons to both
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we talk a little bit about your
hypothesis and then also some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges in setting up the methodology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general hypothesis, right,
is organisms like to be around other
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms, particularly plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of research that I'm
really just starting to scratch the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface on as far as plants not only
recognizing that there are other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: around, but they can understand the
identity of those plants around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if those plants that are neighboring
them, they are of the same species or
[SPEAKER_01]: conspecifics, they will actually behave in
altruistic behaviors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll actually sacrifice some of
their own energy to alert plants of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same species nearby that there's a pest or
something's going on or there's some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of other ailment or perturbation in the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've heard of this,
or some people may have heard of this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of word get thrown around about what's
called tree talk, which is trees can share
[SPEAKER_01]: these ectomycorrhizal fungus associations
for miles and miles and miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're communicating in the soil using
these kinds of fungal networks,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole host of different,
again, mechanisms that may help assist
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in figuring out, well, is this
neighbor next to me going to hurt me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to have to compete with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to have to attack it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to have to defend myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: From it, or is this a like species that
I'll be able to actually share a network
[SPEAKER_01]: with to promote growth or health or
resiliency?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hypothesis was to, you know,
we would, we expected that plants of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same species, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly even the same strains would
actually work together when grown in these
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil beds, rather than when they're
grown in isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't have the opportunity to share
information through network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other research has been done where even
plants touching another plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, literally rubbing up against
another plant can induce stress levels or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, other kinds of responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we used the system that
Goldleaf has been using, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: for four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to note that we're not
starting out with fresh soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting out with very well-aged and
advanced soil, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is important to note that is we use
the same soil in both the beds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all coming from the same
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took these beds and we put six
plants in each bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those six plants were then
contained in one trellis, which kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: helps with secondary growth and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took six plants and put them
individually in 12 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those six plants would share a
trellis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just would try to control or
hold constant at all the other variables,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the best way to do that is to have
them try to share a space as close as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all know that lighting,
lighting spectrum, lighting intensity can
[SPEAKER_01]: change pretty rapidly, even moving around
the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to have these beds and these
pots kind of side by side to try to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: that constant, try to control for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waterings were all done at the same times
and at the same levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watering was held constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, they were all
harvested at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wet weights were measured at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the methodology and a
hypothesis behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ben, many people would look at a trial
like this and just say something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, duh, I mean, we all know that plants
would like to be in beds over pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important that we do try
and test these things out to actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of examples in
science where we take things for granted
[SPEAKER_00]: as being as being true without actually
testing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Tim Wilson with microbe organics
who I've had on the podcast was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that really opened my eyes to that
in a lot of ways around things with
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a really good point because
it's kind of a side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, my whole Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: on Maury Eels started out asking these
really kind of advanced questions as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as larval dispersal and ocean currents and
genetic makeups of populations and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these really kind of like questions that
you would expect to answer or to ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, you know, in this kind of in
this day and age of marine research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was doing the background research
to try to just lay the foundation to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer those questions, I was finding
pothole after pothole after just non
[SPEAKER_01]: existent pothole of of of information on
really basic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as how old can a moray get?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do they move?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do they move?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many can occur in a given area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these kind of very fundamental,
basic natural history, biological
[SPEAKER_01]: questions had not been answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me six months to find the
answer to how old does a California moray
[SPEAKER_01]: live?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would look around on museum or
aquarium websites just kind of general
[SPEAKER_01]: info and you'd get, oh, they could live to
be about almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, where did that data come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the source on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you always got to try to
figure out is who did the study?
[SPEAKER_01]: When was it done and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me six months to trace down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out that that age of a moray
came from a single individual that was
[SPEAKER_01]: living in a tank and it got published.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was back in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just based on that single anecdotal non
representation of a natural population,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had this kind of data point that laid
the framework for decades of this is how
[SPEAKER_01]: old a moray can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the cannabis industry is at
the same point where you have been,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's everybody's been
researching cannabis in their own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their own backyard, in their own,
you know, what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's gotten to the point where it's
scaled up so much that really
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding these questions and
collecting the right data can make really
[SPEAKER_01]: big financial have really big financial
implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really the whole how to
grow cannabis, whether it be organically
[SPEAKER_01]: or hydroponically or what have you,
is that a kind of a really big turning
[SPEAKER_01]: point right now where the data really
needs to start being collected on things
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe we've always taken for granted
because we really don't know outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some anecdotal stuff if that's
really true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to I want to touch on some of
these things within the experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: design really quickly and then get into
what you found for the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you were using beds that
were custom made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were three feet by three and three
quarter feet by three quarter feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this will be in the white paper
and you can go on to the website at
[SPEAKER_00]: kisserganics.com and it'll be the latest
blog post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also put links up to it on the
podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each plant had in the container,
it looks like it worked out to one point
[SPEAKER_00]: five five cubic feet of soil per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the bed, it worked out to one
point four one cubic feet of soil per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually had more soil per plant in
the bed and in the pot than you did in the
[SPEAKER_00]: communal bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at it, lighting was
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the things that you mentioned were
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your metric was the wet weight,
because unfortunately, in the way your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility processes, you weren't able to
collect dry weights accurately because
[SPEAKER_00]: things get moved around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It involved kind of tracing the same bud
through a host of different processes and
[SPEAKER_01]: across many different employees handling
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just one of those things that,
again, if the cost really is there and it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes financial sense to really track this
kind of data down, then that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, first pass at an exploratory
study kind of such as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really make sense to try to mess
up the workflow, so to speak, to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: track down that kind of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you took the information that
you gathered, the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you ran it through a significance,
two keys on a significant test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which frankly, I don't really understand
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to get into it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the long story short was you threw out
one outlier in your data, the Koloa
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise that actually yielded really well
in the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't actually thrown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I decided not to throw it out
is because there wasn't actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically different, a significantly
different result between the homogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: bed or the cloth pot for the Koloa
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it in the white paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see grateful breath, which was
found to be significant, has a little
[SPEAKER_01]: asterisk above the two bars, which would
indicate that grateful breath actually
[SPEAKER_01]: grew significantly better in homogenous
beds than it did in the cloth pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Koloa, while it did grow much better,
it wasn't significantly better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had it been significant, then kind of you
go through this decision tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is it significant because of this
weird outlier bed that did really good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in which case you remove that and then
you run the test again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it's significant, then you can
keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not significant, then you kind of
go back to your experimental design and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out, well, what's the question I'm
asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this one outlier truly an outlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get into the whole idea of
you need more data kind of marathon to
[SPEAKER_01]: really make sure that it wasn't an
outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just, you know, if we had
another bed that was between the mean or
[SPEAKER_01]: the average for the homogenous bed for
Koloa sunrise and that outlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: then all of a sudden that outlier doesn't
become an outlier, just becomes the
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum value for that group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the way the statistics
work for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, grateful breath was
significantly better in homogenous beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, all of the three strains we
tested did perform better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of brings up another
interesting point where the fields of
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics and academia maybe clash a
little bit with, you know, business
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're growing something and
it's better, but it's not significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: better, then it really comes down to you
know, an ROI return on investment kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: question where, you know, is it worth
investing this many resources to get this
[SPEAKER_01]: much better?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go, you have your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least this kind of data does show
that, well, yeah, if I have to spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more on beds than pots,
for example, I will at least recoup this
[SPEAKER_01]: money faster because the plants will be
growing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this, this white paper is far from
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be fair, and this is something we've
talked about at length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we talked about
was that it really would be good to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, visually, I think you commented to me
that the buds looked very comparable in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the ratio of, you know,
sort of leaf matter to buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be, you know, in theory,
you could have a result where the
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous bed produced a lot of leaf
matter, but much smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your dry weight, which is your
actual metric could be much lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, we weren't able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other thing with science is
if you're able to create this result in
[SPEAKER_00]: your, in this, in Goldleaf facility,
you'd want to replicate it again in
[SPEAKER_00]: Goldleaf, but you'd also want to replicate
it in other facilities, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using, right, to really test the
question you're really trying to get at
[SPEAKER_01]: is, do I want to grow my plants together
or do I want to grow them separately?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would really even want to try to
grow plants in brand new soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to what we have at Goldleaf,
which is this, you know, aged,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, reused, re-amended kind of
sustained medium, because then you could
[SPEAKER_01]: say, well, I test, now the medium becomes
a non-factor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you switch the medium completely and
you still get the same result,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're still on that, that picking up
that right pattern, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like, well, it's not the,
you know, secret sauce of having really
[SPEAKER_01]: old high biodiverse soil, because I got
the same results, you know, using brand
[SPEAKER_01]: new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, then you start to gather more
power to kind of supporting your
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you test as many different
combinations of as many different
[SPEAKER_01]: variables, just try to nail down that one
question, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you could try different watering
techniques and you could try different
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you still get that same result,
then you gain confidence in saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: there really is something here about
growing a plant among neighbors rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than an isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the paper too talks about,
you know, what's happening underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you know, active mycorrhizal
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And communication between plants and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another great variable that would be
fantastic to measure would be the root
[SPEAKER_01]: mass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do we see that these roots are,
you know, putting out a lot more biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in a bed, reaching out to
neighbors as opposed to in isolation where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really nothing to handshake with,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you really got to get into well,
is it the plants that they're going after
[SPEAKER_01]: or are they just exploring more soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you're starting to get into
surface area to volume ratios about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a plant maybe feels an edge of a
pot differently than it feels the edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: a bigger volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all the, like I said,
the rabbit holes that you can quickly find
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself getting down, which are all in
incredibly interesting scientifically and
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it does come down to how is my
business going to stay open, make more
[SPEAKER_01]: money, those things don't always align.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really a good starting point
for people in exploring this idea of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in a growing space or in a
growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted to gain more confidence in
that, the fact that what is allowing for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant growth is really the communal
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of these plants, then we would want to
grow in cocoa using a nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, our chelated ionic nutrients,
or we'd want to grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in other media and in other methods and
see if we can replicate that same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, at the end of the day,
if you're running a facility, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really care as much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just care about what your results are
in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for gold leaf, in this case,
growing in these communal beds makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one thing that we can
probably take away from this white paper
[SPEAKER_00]: more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing research, you're
looking at ways you can profit off of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for gold leaf, you're going to profit
more by continuing to grow in the manner
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were, I guess, is essentially
what we came to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are three out of the
almost at least hundreds of strains we
[SPEAKER_01]: have currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: At gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see already, we have one
strain that did significantly better than
[SPEAKER_01]: the other two were not significantly
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that right there is a question,
why grateful breath?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's going to be just
some genetics involved there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when you get into,
well, why does the genetics of grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: breath respond significantly better than
the other two do not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can ask these questions
until you're blue in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, it's six years
later and you're trying to finish a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how science works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you really know if you're
doing it well, if at the end of an
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment, you have more questions than
when you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: The uncovering of a pattern or a mechanism
really does open doors that if done
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, you didn't even know were there
yet because you didn't let the data tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you where the different results could come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if it's the bed or the pot
or if it's the plant or the genetics or
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, go on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you do the data collection right,
you get all these interesting patterns and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to figure out why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then off you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's since we have a few of these papers
to kind of talk about and a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: things we want to mention, let's go ahead
and move on to talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mats and some of your results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, probably about what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months ago, eight months ago,
we got some blue mats set up at Goldleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare the hand watering that was
going on in Goldleaf with an automated
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system like blue mats,
where the plant really controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: controls the watering process based on the
moisture content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we were it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some enough blue mat material to
run basically 11 of the of the beds that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have in a given room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to see if we could maybe
save a little bit of time on labor and if
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants responded better, the same
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Goldleaf, it's a very much hands on,
you know, organic craft mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the plants are at least visually
seen once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not more than that is a very intimate
relationship between the gardeners and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hand watering is something that's a
daily multi, you know, it happens all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we, we plant strains in
homogenous beds, meaning so you have one
[SPEAKER_01]: strain per bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have in one bed, you'll have,
you know, pineapple mimosa, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next bed, you'll have animal
sherbet too, right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when someone's going around watering,
you're really kind of watering by
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and by either feel or by visual
inspection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that looks damp or pick up a clump
of dirt and mush it around and well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that feels dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you water accordingly, but as
anybody knows, you know, my dry may be
[SPEAKER_01]: different than your dry and your wet might
be my damp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of room for error,
even in amongst experienced gardeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this blue mass does is it kind of
allows the plant to be the captain of its
[SPEAKER_01]: own watering needs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets to make that decision for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanted to do is we wanted to
put a bunch of these different strains
[SPEAKER_01]: side by side, as we normally do,
and run a blue mass supply line with some
[SPEAKER_01]: blue soak drip tape through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just opposite them, we would run the
same setup just without the blue mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be the same strains mirrored on
either side of this aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, the right aisle would be
11 or so different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left side would be the same
strains, just not, you know, fitted with
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue mat system and hand watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those were installed,
I think the day after the plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted into the, into the beds and
those were installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would go around and make sure that
the, the soil moisture was kind of hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: around right at a hundred M bar kind of as
a, you know, as a previous discussion I
[SPEAKER_01]: had with you about what the, what that
kind of soil makeup would, would benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we let those things just run.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beds that were retrofitted with blue
mats did receive additional inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it's compost teas or
different, you know, feeding regimes and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was done outside of the blue mat
system, because if you try to throw too
[SPEAKER_01]: much organic material through the water,
those, you know, tight lines and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get fouled up pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're, you're having some not
favorable things getting water into your
[SPEAKER_01]: beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just strictly water that was
going through the blue mat system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that both the blue mats and
the non blue mats beds were getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: were receiving the identical feeding
regimes, which is, which was again,
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's something you want to hold
constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was a, it was a really cool
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let the beds run all the way to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, similarly to the pots
versus beds white paper, we just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stop data collection at the above ground
biomass or the wet weights and just
[SPEAKER_01]: compared those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you tried out a couple different
designs here for the blue mats too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a little bit of data from
that, but the main thing was just
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing hand watering versus an
automated system like blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it's important to
distinguish between automated irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems too, because even with these ones
that are on timers, we're still,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still, we're still manually as a
human telling the plant when it wants or
[SPEAKER_00]: needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with this blue mat system,
we're just maintaining the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content at the, at a current level that we
establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give credit to giant Palmer
for the hundred M bar Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that he came up with
through his research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to test out some different,
you know, it'd be good to repeat this and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, you know, 110 M bar, 190 or what
range is, is possibly optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of right now, I think a hundred's a
great starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, let's talk a little bit
about your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you find, uh, using the
automated watering, the blue mats versus
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to emphasize that the guys
that we had hand watering for this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, I know a lot of them
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known them for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're excellent at their jobs and
they're, they know how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's not just like some random
hires off the road that are watering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know, some of these guys have
been doing it for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, super committed to the craft and
just absolutely love the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was great to be able to have that,
to compare something like this too,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to, like you said, just someone
who, you know, looks at a, at the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: sees, sees if it's gray or black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so kind of in short, the w it was
actually pretty surprising every,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, so we tested five strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested a birthday cake, pineapple
mimosa, animal sherbet to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: wedding cake and mimosa and all but mimosa
had way more biomass at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest cycle than the non blue mat,
um, non blue mat replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, um, wedding cake averaged
about, so this again is a trellis weight
[SPEAKER_01]: of about, uh, this is eight plants now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we bumped up the plants per bed for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we were getting about six pounds
per trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the blue mat bed for wedding cake and
the non blue mat bed, we had a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different controls running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we averaged those and we were getting
just north of four pounds per eight
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that right there is roughly a 20,
almost, almost 30% increase in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in above ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is, was pretty shocking to me at
least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was shocking to everybody
else there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't expect to see that kind
of bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just basically on letting the plants
kind of take the water when they felt they
[SPEAKER_01]: needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think again, this will be something
that we need to test more of.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we're doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loved the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we probably did save a little bit of
money as far as labor goes, or at least we
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to focus the, the attention of
the employees on something a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more delicate than, than, than watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we want to, again, see how this
works across strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if the result holds up,
then that's, that's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the, the awesome thing about
having a bunch of different strains side
[SPEAKER_01]: by side again, is you'll have the plant
dictate what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of concept of,
of homeostasis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, like for, for human, for example,
if you get too hot, you're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting outside of that thermostat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermal neutral zone, and you're going to
start sweating.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get too cold, you start slipping
away from your happy spot, your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, you know, your, your set point on
your thermostat and you start to shiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't be surprised if there was
the same kind of homeostasis envelope for
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can be dialed a little
differently, even across strains where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one plant might be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, at 110 M bar would be
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if plus 50 minus 50 below
that, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it does dip below that for,
or above that for a little, you might see
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, you know, start to stress out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what these blue mats do is that allows
the, there's just a constant supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: water and the plants get to dictate when
they, when they need a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the results are pretty intriguing,
um, and promising certainly enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: merit a second run, which like I said,
we're, we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things interesting here
with this, with the mimosa is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it makes me wonder if maybe it would
be curious to measure what if plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are hand watered versus plants that are
watered with a blue mat to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much water those plants are
getting in those beds and then say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, well, maybe the mimosa needs less
water just because that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, you know, for example,
likes less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or slightly drier soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the main benefit of this blue
mat is maintaining the moisture content at
[SPEAKER_00]: a level where we get a lot of microbial
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you said, that, that idea of
homeostasis when it gets too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes slow down and it gets too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you have similar issues and then you
have root problems with the, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were going to save on labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not think you would get that much of
a bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: In yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, us too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, we're all pretty excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're, we're going with a bunch
of different strains for this next round
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're, we're going to keep the same
setup, um, as we had before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can compare these data across
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to change, you know,
the designs or the variables, because then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're introducing a bunch of different
very, a bunch of different variables and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of variability between studies,
in which case you can't start to compile
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this big data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep the way you collect the
data to save the methodology the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it is across rounds, because that
way you can compare these data to previous
[SPEAKER_01]: rounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is super important because
otherwise these just become tiny little
[SPEAKER_01]: standalone experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in fact, we want to have a big kind
of overarching data set that spans rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that spans strains and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the way to do that is to hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you collect the data constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I just want to throw in a real
quick, shameless sales pitch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested in blue mats,
I think Ben and I have worked out some
[SPEAKER_00]: really great designs and, uh, Ben is
actually helping me now with the blue mat
[SPEAKER_00]: designs and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in a custom blue
mat set up for, you know, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's beds or containers or greenhouse or
outdoor fields, uh, please shoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot me an email and, uh, I'll put you in
touch with Ben and we can get something
[SPEAKER_00]: set up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with a variety of different
designs right now for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know you have a couple other
papers that you're or trials that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running right now in the facility,
uh, that you, we haven't quite gotten all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data on yet, but I wanted to just
mention them since I'm going to have you
[SPEAKER_00]: on the phone here and we'll, we'll get you
back on possibly to talk about them when
[SPEAKER_00]: the papers are done, but tell me a little
bit about your experience with Mammoth P.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys got some samples from them
and you started playing around with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, we're collecting some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks over at mammoth P where we're
super gracious and gave us, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: about a gallon of their stuff to kind of
poke around and play around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was, we, we were, we've tested
many different kind of microbial and micro
[SPEAKER_01]: risal concoctions, um, before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a good system set up already.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, um, testing this, um, already in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we, the, the, the label actually
does a really great job of making it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the instructions are basically
on how often and how much the dilution
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios and, and when to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we wanted to get this stuff into
the ground and into the plants as fast as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we didn't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started off with a, like I would say a
controlled kind of method, all
[SPEAKER_01]: methodological set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just kind of said, let's get it in
there and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, you know, some preliminary
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's again, not really set up,
you know, like a full blown scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but even with that one run in that one
room, we got about a 12% bump in wet
[SPEAKER_01]: weight harvests across all strains,
uh, using mammoth P as a, as a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil microbial additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're, we're trying to work with
the folks in mammoth P to maybe get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more soil and do a really
robust, um, trial with that, because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a very easy thing to figure out as
far as, well, if I buy this much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I get this much in return,
it's a very easy cost benefit analysis to
[SPEAKER_01]: run, um, to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mammoth P trials are still ongoing
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, the gold leaf facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has morphed into this awesome lab and,
and, and just being able to test all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different products and, and get some data
behind these things has been really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to see the research on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I looked at the mammoth P under
the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the only microbial products on
the market that I'm aware of that's
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled and still has motile bacteria,
which I think is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, uh, I did do a, uh, video on
YouTube brewing it and adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: food sources to see if I could increase
the biology in there and maintain the same
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like at least three of the
four survived, but, um, I know they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily encourage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I was, uh, I was quite impressed
though, that you got the results that you
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see a lot of soil tests where the
Malik three test, which is the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tells you everything that's on the
soil, uh, will show very high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see levels upwards of 700 to a thousand
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's crazy, uh, way more than
any way, way, way more than you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see very low available
phosphorus, whether it's because of the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: or because you don't have the right
microbes to make the phosphorus available
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's where I think mammoth P is,
is a really interesting option for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the way we're kind of looking at
it is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these, these kind of big macro
nutrients sitting in the soil and just by
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of increasing the, the chefs,
so to speak, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little, the little cooks that can make
this stuff and chop these things up and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them more readily available to the
plants, uh, at a faster rate may be what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're seeing here drive these,
these yields is just a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, mammoth P is something that we,
you know, I, Colin's, Colin's an old
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the company, um,
and what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, yeah, please don't hesitate to
reach out to you on the mammoth P thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are interested in finding out
more, um, or I might be able to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to send you a sample or I can
send you a sample if you're local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, they've dropped some off just
the other day in our store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, uh, the one that I
think I'm most excited for, which is this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, generically, you could say it's an led
versus HPS conversation, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, uh, we, we have some lights
that you guys set up from bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sliding, which is, uh, I've had Rebecca on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the, the NASA founded led company
and, uh, your current technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a double ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you guys were kind of, when Nate
first set up the facility, there really
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the, uh, research around leds and
the price point was so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now he's looking, now you guys are
looking into what's the cost benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: switching over to leds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a really interesting
trial and a question that a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, want to know the answer to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are they worth the additional cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca actually came to go leaf a couple
of weeks ago and her and I sat down and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and came up with these really,
you know, kind of elaborate different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: we can try to get at the, the,
you know, how well an led does for a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain plant for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a total nerd out session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, we, we actually, we actually
started with the kind of working
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where again, me and her could go down any
which way path to find the mechanisms for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is it spectrum, is it
chlorophyll profiles, all this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what, what folks want to know
is, am I going to grow more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to grow better quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if I do, how much do I have to
grow to recoup what I spent on top of what
[SPEAKER_01]: I could normally have spent on,
you know, some, some older, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we're going to do is
we're coming out with a white paper here
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon, where we've actually analyzed
some of our, um, electricity, like our
[SPEAKER_01]: utility load data to try to parse out how
many cycles, how many harvests we would
[SPEAKER_01]: need in order to recoup the price of
installing, um, these bioflights in one of
[SPEAKER_01]: our rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that hopefully should be coming out
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next one we're doing,
um, is actually just going to be another,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, another trial of, you know,
setting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, it's eight of these bioflights in
one of the flower rooms and all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: outer edge, um, are the, the old kind of
HPS fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did put brand new bulbs in those
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could try to get, you know,
as, as even of a comparison as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you say, I'm going to buy a brand
new this or a brand new that again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to make sure that you're not,
you know, I want to, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare a brand new bios to an HPS that's
been hanging there for two or three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's not a totally fair
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we put brand new bulbs and all of
the, you know, the, the HPS lights that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to run against the bios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then this time though,
we, we did come up with some kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: data collection workflow that we will be
able to target, um, the dry weights for
[SPEAKER_01]: the strains in, in this flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make sure we don't only
have the harvest weight, but we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that wet weight, that harvest weight
translate into sellable actual product and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if, if that actually, um, makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, those lights were put up there,
um, Oh, a couple of months ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end of the harvest for that one
room, uh, should be happening here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In which case we have, um, our controls
already set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that the mothers are
treated the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that the clones are
treated the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that, you know,
the young vegetative stages are treated
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only possible difference
would be when exposed to the bios lights
[SPEAKER_01]: or the SPH lights with the new bulbs,
once they get transferred into that flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should be happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in the next two or three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also randomizing those
clones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not setting aside at the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under bias because they look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are going to go into HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're randomizing it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how easy, um, human bias can
kind of creep in there where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, it's not even a purposeful thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To say, well, I want, you know,
if I'm going to spend the money on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bios lights, I want these results to look
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then almost subconsciously you're
going to look and put all those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the best, tallest clones under
into the bios lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we're going to be
doing is we're going to actually be,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, like you said, randomizing the
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say we're going to be using 120
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of those 120 plants are going to
get assigned a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that number will be thrown into a
randomly generated number sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those will decide which of the
clones goes into under the bios lights
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and which of the clones go under
the, the HPS light treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it is, you just want to try to
weed out and get rid of as many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biases or preconceived kind of notions to
try to really get down to the core data
[SPEAKER_01]: for the question you're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now tell me about what you're seeing
anecdotally so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know you have already flowered
some plants under the bios lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you didn't, weren't set up to actually
collect that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize there's issues around
lighting intensity and getting the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: used to a different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things can all affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I hooked my head into this room the
other day and I was pretty taken aback by
[SPEAKER_01]: how tall the plants were that were under
the full spectrum of the bios lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning, you know, the bios lights,
because they're LEDs, they have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more of a focused area that they
cover, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not such a splash zone that you
might get with an HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're off center or, you know,
offset a certain amount of feet from these
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, the intensity goes down pretty
quick and we actually just happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: have three of the same strains grown next
to each other in three different,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, you know, three different beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that were fully under the
bios lights were probably a good foot and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half to two feet taller than the ones
that were grown just out of the reach of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bios lights and kind of under this
probably mixed spectrum of LED and HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of wash out, you know, ambient kind
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, they look much, much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course we want to make sure that,
you know, bigger means better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're really got to target
the wet weights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if we're getting taller plants,
that might be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got more internotal spacing
and they get stretchy, you might not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get the result you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have less buds or not as big,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the data you really,
you know, you want to capture does really
[SPEAKER_01]: get out the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like you were even saying,
bigger is not always better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bigger might be great,
but if it comes down to what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually selling a customer, you know,
that might not actually still hold true by
[SPEAKER_01]: that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, the results look pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting much bigger flowering
plants, but we got to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: translates into, you know, jarrable or
processable product down the line.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also testing the final bud to see
what sort of cannabinoid expression you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to, I think is important with
terpene levels and see, cause those,
[SPEAKER_00]: those will all change with lighting
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fairly well established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis is that we'll see an
improvement in all of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give credit to Outco and Dr.
Allison Justice, because this is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an experiment they've already done
using a fluence lighting, looking at an
[SPEAKER_00]: ROI compared to HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a study they completed,
oh, I think two, three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's available as well, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of a replication of that
in a different facility to hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: support what, what that data already
showed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's all about just supporting
previous data that's been there or
[SPEAKER_01]: refuting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if you're refuting it,
then you're going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to figure out what the
differences are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can control those great,
if not, then, you know, you go from there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, it's all, everybody is just
trying to figure out the best way to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's great to, to actually have,
you know, some of these scientists and
[SPEAKER_01]: other, other folks that are so committed
to the, to the plant to start to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to hone in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ben, we're getting a little long on
this podcast and we haven't even gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that I'm most excited about
announcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that's happened in
the past, oh, let's say six to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months now, Ben, myself and Nathan Gibbs,
who's the owner of Goldleaf have formed a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Kaizen Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little about what
Kaizen means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaizen comes from the, the old Japanese
manufacturing methodology of, of
[SPEAKER_01]: continuous improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like we are doing now with testing
different things and different products
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and Goldleaf's been kind of the
forefront on this is, is we just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously improve, you know,
much like your podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, just the, the cultivation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Kaizen is, is basically that kind
of philosophy put into, put into a
[SPEAKER_01]: business, a consulting business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited about this because I,
I get requests almost daily for
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting, whether it's about soil or
facility design or, or, or just a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions from literally all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing, mostly because of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I didn't feel qualified to
offer a consulting on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I know and I know what I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the opportunity to partner with
Nate's who has been running, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, multiple hundred light grows
for, oh geez, decades now he's been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it for back in the medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been successful at it in a very,
very challenging Washington market where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've created, you know, the,
this, this brand, this high end brand
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the consistency and quality of
their flower where they're still getting
[SPEAKER_00]: top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that is the,
the communities created there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the worker community, the,
the thoughtfulness he's put into both the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and the marketing of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it because he's always sending
me these books to read and quoting these
[SPEAKER_00]: other books.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's continuously learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really fits with the name of the
consulting group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and Ben is really bringing the,
the research and science aspect to it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're able to start collecting data
and, and have data driven answers for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are coming to me and coming to
us as a, as a consulting group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea behind like what I want to make
sure we contribute to the whole operation
[SPEAKER_01]: here, the whole kind of collective think
tank that is growing cannabis is I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't want to come up with
something that says, Oh, this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this product's great without having a
graph or some kind of data or some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: trial or study to say why this product is
great or why this product isn't great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ultimately, again, it is up to
whatever farm or garden to make up their
[SPEAKER_01]: own mind, but you know, they're with this
market coming online so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what everyone I think is assuming to
be so massively is that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to see a lot of things being sold
that will promise so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already seeing that some of
these things do work and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things we don't see, you know,
at least in the way we do things,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they claim to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to make sure is we want to
continuously improve how things are grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it can be an organic, sustainable
fashion, that's all the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which of these new products that are
coming online from all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are going to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most kind of economic and,
like I said, sustainable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening to this podcast,
you've probably heard my voice way too
[SPEAKER_00]: much and you know, kind of my opinions and
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now heard a little bit from Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do a podcast with Nate Gibbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually watch that one on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a coffee shop chatting,
not so much about the cultivation aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of things, but more about like lean
manufacture, lean farming, and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other aspects of running a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's an interesting podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found that there were still
gaps in sort of our consulting knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: where we wanted to fill those with the top
minds that we knew in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've partnered with Dr. Allison
Justice, who's amazing and has done some
[SPEAKER_00]: done some real work for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to her podcast on the show
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also Chris Jagger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Allison really has a lot of experience
now with hemp and extraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: As sustainably as you can with using
chemical nutrients in sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-tier LED vertical growing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Chris Jagger is really
experienced in sort of outdoor hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where he came from the agricultural
side of things, growing vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is now doing sort of a combination,
intercropping with hemp and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this team that we found, I'm really
excited about everyone on it is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested, I would say,
please do reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, you want to give them the website?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's www.grow, G-R-O-W, with
W-I-T-H, Kaizen, K-A-I-Z-E-N.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a form right there on the
front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read a little bit about our bios.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fill out that form,
someone will be reaching out to you
[SPEAKER_00]: shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to add
about the white papers or about Kaizen or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put links to everything that's
available right now on the podcast page,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm extremely excited to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really inspiring being around
folks like you, Tad, who are so passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis and soil and biology and
folks like Nate, who are so passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: about everything that they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that totally comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the products that comes from Gold Leaf
and all the gardeners and folks that work
[SPEAKER_01]: there and have worked there for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to be kind of part
of this whole team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to helping other
folks, as we like to say, grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing and talk to
you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Dr. Ben Higgins, Chief Research
Scientist with Gold Leaf Gardens and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my partners in Kaizen Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted the white paper we discussed on
the podcast on our website blog page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to www.kisorganics.com and click
on the blog link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in consulting,
you can go to www.growwithkaizen.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's G-R-O-W-W-I-T-H-K-A-I-Z-E-N.com to
