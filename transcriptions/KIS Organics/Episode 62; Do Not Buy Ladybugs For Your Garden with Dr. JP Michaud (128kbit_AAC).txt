[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week's podcast is all about ladybugs
or lady beetles as they are commonly known
[SPEAKER_01]: and why you should never purchase them
online or in a garden center.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing to mention, if you find
this podcast as fascinating as I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should check out the Lost Ladybug
Project at lostladybug.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find and photograph local ladybugs
and send them to entomologists at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: for identification and data logging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a fun project to do with
science-minded kids or something I plan on
[SPEAKER_01]: doing myself the next time I see an
interesting one in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is J.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michaud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Michaud is a professor of entomology
at Kansas State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an insect ecologist specializing in
biological control and other aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: crop protection entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a background in evolutionary
ecology and many of his research endeavors
[SPEAKER_01]: are guided by the implications of
evolutionary theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: His interests include cultural and
conservational approaches to biological
[SPEAKER_01]: control of aphids in field crops,
ecology of the coccinellidae, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper word for lady beetles I learned,
and the interface between host plant
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance and biological control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Michaud completed his bachelor of
science at McGill University and his
[SPEAKER_01]: master's and PhD at Simon Fraser
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, J.P., thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks for inviting me, Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to hear you speak down at the
biocontrols meeting last month in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were the keynote speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you talked
about was why people should not be buying
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs or lady beetles, as they're
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk a little bit about what
ladybugs are, talk about their life cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: before we dive into these reasons why
they're not a good idea to purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, I'm referring to one
particular species of lady beetles that's
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested from the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of life cycles, they're all
pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a life cycle, depending on temperature,
will take about 25 to 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: so about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a full metamorphosis,
so egg, larval, pupal stages, followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both the larval stage and the adult
stage feed on aphids and other small,
[SPEAKER_00]: soft-bodied insects and the eggs of other
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the larval stage is going to last
anywhere from, I would say, 14 to 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the period where they're
consuming aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the bigger they get,
the more they consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the adults can live quite a variable
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also feed on aphids, but the females
eat a lot more aphids than the males,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when they're producing eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But come fall, in shorter days and cooler
temperatures, different lady beetles have
[SPEAKER_00]: different strategies for surviving the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them in North America go into
some kind of diapause.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hibernate, just like other animals do
in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they become dormant and very quiescent,
and they remain that way until spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the fall generation, they can live
as long as six to eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they start reproducing in the
spring, then they start dying very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have another generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here in central,
where I am in central North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of generations per year will
vary from anywhere from two to five,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the availability of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, out here in the high plains,
it's harder for them to survive the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is the winter when it's hot and
dry, because there's no aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually go into a different type
of diapause we call estivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out and about trying to glean a
bit of foods, stay hydrated, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that, when they stop
reproducing, they can live several,
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three months, even in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, once they find a good patch of
aphids, they start to produce eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females will again start dying very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the trade-off to diapause.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do reproduce, you reproduce less,
but it's better than reproducing when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no food around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I've seen different types of
ladybugs in my area up here in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_01]: some that look more like what I would see
available in, like you said, when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to a store or garden center, a lot of
times you'll see them there in the little
[SPEAKER_01]: bags moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many different species of ladybugs are
there approximately in a given area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there an easy way to tell them
apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because lady beetles are what we
call aposematic, so most of them produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bad tasting alkaloid in their
blood, which makes them very distasteful
[SPEAKER_00]: for birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're brightly colored to advertise
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, they have very
distinctive coloration patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as insects go, they're pretty
easy to tell apart, but there's hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of species and you still really have to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common species around are very
abundant and everybody will recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: those, but there's a lot of rare species
that are probably in areas where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see them as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are extremely small,
as small as two millimeters across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people are unaware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those eat just mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different species,
but the ones that most people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be familiar with, there's probably three
to five very common species that occur all
[SPEAKER_00]: across North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those, of course, is the one
you're seeing that people sell in these
[SPEAKER_00]: bags or containers is called the
convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one that is sold by mail
order all over the country and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: should not be allowed by law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, because the beetle itself
is widely distributed as a species,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no regulatory control of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what people are doing now,
the interesting thing about Hippodamia in
[SPEAKER_00]: a mountainous area like in central,
in the Sierra Nevadas of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall, they form aggregations to go
into this hibernation state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually, people actually go up
there and they find these sites and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can shovel them into buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're collecting these beetles
for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this has really put all the people
who used to rear and sell lady beetles out
[SPEAKER_00]: of business because it doesn't cost
anything to shovel them into buckets,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it costs a lot to rear them in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet these are the very, these beetles
should not be shipped because first of
[SPEAKER_00]: all, let's get to efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the old beetles that have
survived the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the females have very little eggs left
in them and they're held in cold storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you bring them out of cold
storage, their automatic response is to
[SPEAKER_00]: fly away because they're way up in the
mountains and they have to come down the
[SPEAKER_00]: valley in a natural situation to find
something to eat in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't tend to stay where people
release all these beetles in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have a greenhouse,
you can contain some of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you really want ideally releasing
adults, you want them to lay some eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's those larvae that are going
to be diligent about combing every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting every last aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these older beetles,
they're hardly really have any eggs left
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like little old ladies with canes
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're really not very effective,
but there's bigger and more to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning ecological issues, which is the
fact that they have their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have parasites, they have
diseases, and those diseases and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: suite of organisms associated with those
beetles in California is not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as that occurring in other parts
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're moving these things around
and mailing them across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also redistributing their diseases
and their natural enemies to other
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial populations which may not have
the same level of resistance or
[SPEAKER_00]: co-adaptation to these diseases and
parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is they have very different
behaviors, even the same species,
[SPEAKER_00]: different populations and very different
behaviors here, for example, in the high
[SPEAKER_00]: plains than they do on the coast or where
you are up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different climate, weather
system, even different patterns of prey
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization, what they can survive on and
what they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dramatic differences between populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you move these beetles around
and they leave and they get out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go and they interbreed with the local
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we have a term for that we
call is genetic admixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have the genetics that's
appropriate for that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually, whatever traits
they're conferring when they interbreed
[SPEAKER_00]: with local populations are not going to be
suited to those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just another way we're weakening
local populations of these beetles by
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing them all over the country to
habitats and environments they don't come
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to kind of highlight that
point because I think that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: crucial what you're saying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea that even though you may find
the same species in another part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country from where they're originally
harvested, their behavior is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: different, their disease resistance is
going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could actually, assuming,
let's just say in theory we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and we had a few native lady
beetles already in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we bring in, if we order online and
bring in these other wild harvested ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could be in theory really damaging
those lady beetles ability to protect our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that essentially what you're getting
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on a much larger scale because it's
not going to affect everything in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, but it has the potential for
negative impacts on your local populations
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they will have completely
different biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you this, I've gone and seen
the hippodamia convergences in Puerto
[SPEAKER_00]: Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's lost its ability to diapods,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can feed on some tropical aphids that
you could put our, you know, would not
[SPEAKER_00]: even support the development and survival
of our populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it acquired over the years
completely different set of adaptations to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you could still bring them here
and interbreed them with our beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you'd have a mishmash of traits
in the hybrid progeny that really wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work well in either setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference between these different
populations is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've been studying
for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've done comparisons in our lab
of hippodamia from Georgia, from
[SPEAKER_00]: California, and from right here in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, for example,
insecticide resistance, the ones from
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia, you can spray them all day long
with pyrethroids and organophosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides, and they don't even die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can reach, we basically
reached the solubility limit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides and we couldn't kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, they'll just dry at the
drop of a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is because in
Georgia, they have a lot of cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: production and it's very chemically
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the hippodamia in Georgia have this
ridiculous high level of insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance that you don't see in other
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we just did as a
result of our agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine what nature has done in terms
of making them different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the insecticide thing is really
interesting because that's sort of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: see with a lot of our pests and why bio
controls are so important is because we
[SPEAKER_01]: create these pesticidal resistances from
spraying all these pesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, consistently over time on a
given population.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go down to Brazil and you've
got completely different species of
[SPEAKER_00]: coccinella that are abundant in cotton
production there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all resistant to pesticides too
now because they had to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coccinella, that's the dino campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the that you're talking about
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I coccinella is the generic term for lady
beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the family coccinella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the coccinella is just a lady
beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the dino campus coccinella?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dino campus coccinella used to be called a
different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hymenopterous peristoid in the
family braconidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the family that has a lot of
different parasitoids, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: little aphid parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in that family.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are much bigger than the aphid
parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting thing is they are all
female, so they don't produce males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, there's a big advantage of that,
of course, because when they emerge from
[SPEAKER_00]: their host in the spring, they don't have
to look for a mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just go out and start stinging
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attack the adult beetles and then the
larvae develops inside and crawls out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting because it's
turning out to be a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parasitoid doesn't just inject an
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also injects some viruses, which modify
the behavior of the beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what actually happens is once the
mature larvae exits through the anus of
[SPEAKER_00]: the host, it spins a cocoon because it's a
little wasp larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the adult beetle that's still alive
clings to it and protects it and stays
[SPEAKER_00]: alive for quite a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've actually shown in the field
that if you remove the old parasitized
[SPEAKER_00]: beetle from the cocoon of the parasitoid,
its survival is greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parasitoid needs the beetle to sort
of hug onto it until it finishes its
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves behind this virus in the beetle,
even after it's controlling the behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: of its host, even after it's physically
left it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds a little like Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, fungi do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll alter the behavior of their host
before they kill it so that they end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: a suitable environment for their
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an internal parasite,
though, that's found inside of harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: lady beetles that will come back and kill
your lady beetle or lady bird population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those harvested lady beetles, the pastoids
are diaposing inside the beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're hibernating inside their hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting for spring, just like the
beetles are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their metabolism is all on hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to just slow down
everything and just stay alive until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when you harvest the
beetles there and mail them all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, they're mailing the pastoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've bought bags of beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see between 5% and 15% of those
beetles that are parasitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different spiral plasmas and
different types of little parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial infections and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chronic infections, just like you can
have a sexually transmitted disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, it can really affect your
fitness and your health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these beetles have their little
sexually transmitted diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That live on their surface and suck their
juices and all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, within a localized
population that's isolated from others,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on the other side of the Rocky
Mountains, all of that ecology adapts to
[SPEAKER_00]: what's around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the mites and the parasites,
well, they over time attenuate their
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they kill their too many hosts,
they kill them too quickly, then they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's complex truces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of between all these different
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you take them and you throw
them into a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: population, and they're interbreeding,
and they're sharing all the psychology,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, those populations where you set may
not, or very likely do not have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of resistance to those parasites or
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the ecological concern
there, that this is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important species of lady beetle we have
for controlling aphids, certainly here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas, but in many, many agricultural
settings worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continent wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by moving this population,
everything from this one population and
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading it all over the country,
we're actually doing more harm than good
[SPEAKER_00]: to one of our most important species
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people want to utilize ladybugs or
lady beetles in their garden, or naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: attract these ladybugs, what do you
recommend for people that want to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybird, ladybug health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, same thing for attracting
parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural attraction, if you have a
healthy little ecosystem in your garden or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever, that will come by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, some areas, there's a
landscape effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some areas where they don't
have good reservoirs of lady beetles to
[SPEAKER_00]: attract them from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a very, very, well, I shouldn't
say, there's some species, a few species
[SPEAKER_00]: that thrive even in cities where you have
just one little abandoned lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have some weeds with some aphids
on, you'll find certain species that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it won't be the same diversity you'll
find out in a wildlife reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly, if people live in an urban
habitat where there's a patchwork of
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and some floral resources,
you should have a good reservoirs of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should come by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at all your different
beneficial insects that we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's parasitites, whether it's
predators like lacewings or lady beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point in their life stage,
at some point in their life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need floral resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the adult beetles out here,
it's during the summer and the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, because sometimes the only source
of moisture they can get is from a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of nectar or extra floral
nectar in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flowers act as an actual wetter,
or as a source of moisture in very dry
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pollen is also important because
the pollen is a source of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can actually help them as a
source of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, almost all lady beetles will feed on
pollen and nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of them, but some of them can
actually complete their whole life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: on just pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one species that we know of,
but it's a very important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the 12-spotted lady beetle,
the pink one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can eat a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the point is flowers are going to
attract them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they maybe really need, depending on
their physiological condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may really need that pollen or
nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll come for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they find aphids, then they'll lay
on the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can smell the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can find the aphids quite well on
their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so devoting a certain area of
your garden to perennial flowers will be
[SPEAKER_00]: really beneficial for the average person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing in a greenhouse,
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at high-tunnel situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do better in a high-tunnel
situation by putting lures which smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like plants, all the green leaf volatile
odors and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually having some flowers
there flowering, and they will attract
[SPEAKER_00]: more natural enemies that will do you more
good than actually releasing natural
[SPEAKER_00]: enemies and trying to contain them in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they'll find a way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not where they want to be,
they'll just find a way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you produce the environment
that's attractive, they'll come all by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned perennials in outdoor
settings, because perennials in outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: settings, you're probably going to be
worried about weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly where we are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about all the weeds,
they're annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't compete with perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can establish a good perennial
garden, not only will these you with a mix
[SPEAKER_00]: of species that flowers all summer long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some will flower early, some will
flower mid, some will flower late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weeds will never have a chance to
establish, because the perennials are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up ahead of them, and they have the
stored reserves in their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they out-compete the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they give you a longer period of
flowering natural resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a longer period of attractiveness
for all those beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the same thing are going to
benefit pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a crop that needs pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing a double good thing when
you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just benefiting the beneficials
that eat your patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're benefiting pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we haven't talked about is
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that the ones, I think you
said it was Georgia, were highly resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, what sorts of effects do
traditional or even organic applications
[SPEAKER_01]: of pesticides have on ladybird
populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a deep topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the older materials that were not very
selective, the contact insecticides we
[SPEAKER_00]: were using up until the end of the 20th
century mostly, are all neurotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, there's certain populations
of lady beetles that have had so many
[SPEAKER_00]: generations of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they really have is high titers of
enzymes that can detoxify these things
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last 20 years, there are a lot
of really good, more selective
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides that are, for example,
just kill aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of safer materials that
won't harm the lady beetles at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're a little more expensive,
but they're really selective because they
[SPEAKER_00]: act on, you know, they'll usually be
systemic, get absorbed by the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when the aphid tries to feed and
suck the juices, it's in the juices of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and then the aphid dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all systemic materials are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the most popular one is
probably the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The imidacloprid and the thiamethoxam,
that group, they are actually very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very toxic to all natural enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their uses, their widespread use of
seed treatment as a seed treatment is
[SPEAKER_00]: another source of concern because,
again, that's basically a scorched earth
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want no insects on your crop,
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have no natural enemies when the
seed treatment wears off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, plus these systemic pesticides just
should not be used on edible crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not legal, but for people that
aren't growing legally, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns for the safety and efficacy of
them in terms of consumers consuming or
[SPEAKER_01]: combusting a final cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not sure about the
regulations and all of that, but I can
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee you there's a lot of stuff you
could use to kill aphids that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work really well, but you don't want that
in your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in Canada, that's part of their
national program.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff has to be tested for
residues, just like food, because there is
[SPEAKER_00]: that temptation for people to use things
they shouldn't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you can use systemic
insecticides, aphids aren't hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: control, but the problem is many of those
are amongst the most toxic of all
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go all the way back to aldecarb,
which is banned now, I think, in most
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, because it's just so toxic
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, to be systemic in a plant,
you usually have a water-soluble molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more linear, so it can travel
through the plant's vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's going to travel into you
pretty easily, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that
you shared today that I had no idea about
[SPEAKER_01]: lady beetles, even more so than your
keynote speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything else that you just
would like to share regarding these lady
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some interesting facts or other
information before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's nothing wrong with the idea
of augmenting lady beetles in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could get some that were
mass-reared safely in insectary
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, you know, and one of the
candidates might be Harmoniac serratus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Asian multicolored lady
beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tremendously voracious predator of
aphids in so many different cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, and I know it's present in hop
orchards and places like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it'd probably do fine in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, you know, if it has good
aphids, it'll go on almost any plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these things would not be hard to
re-evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be reared in the laboratory in
large numbers, but the problem is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know anybody that does
it because they can't compete with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are being wild collected that no
one should be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could rear them, there'd be
nothing wrong with augmenting lady beetles
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse if you had a sustainable
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how sustainable all that
harvesting of lady beetles will be over in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, they may start depressing
those populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's nothing wrong with the
concept of augmenting lady beetles if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have some that were massive reared
and you knew they didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: parasites, and you knew they were young
beetles, how old they were, that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start reproducing in a couple of
days and lay lots of eggs all over your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that would be great, but I don't
see that we have that system in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an open system where you
can devote a little space to some floral
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, planting some floral resources,
you're going to attract your own lady
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles and you're going to attract a lot
of other beneficial insects, not just lady
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thank you so much for your time
today and sharing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing your passion for these
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again for your time and I hope
to talk to you again soon.
