[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part two of my recent interview
with my good friend, Suzanne
[SPEAKER_01]: Wainwright-Evans, also known by many as
the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't listened to part one of
this conversation or any of her other
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts with me, I highly suggest
checking them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary focus on biological control and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been on the podcast multiple
times and please do go back and listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of her other podcasts if you haven't
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her website is BugLadyConsulting.com where
you can find links to other webinars,
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts, and information as well as how
to contact her for direct consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things that you've taught
me, again correct me if I misspeak,
[SPEAKER_01]: around oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that you like SufOil,
which is mineral oil-based, also Monterey
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Horticulture Oil, is because it has
less REI requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It biodegrades faster and it's something
that you can spray pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of data showing its
effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new product called EpiShield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with them right now to try
and get it into smaller container sizes so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it can be available to a wider range
of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that product has no REI and smells
phenomenal and it's botanical based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and there's a lot of data to support it
but that's one of the advantages of these
[SPEAKER_01]: oils is that they work as a suffocant and
so the pest can't really develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to them like they could
something that has a neural effect or
[SPEAKER_01]: other mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to correct anything there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean you're absolutely right on,
you know, the the SufOil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean one of the reasons I like that too
is because of particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small particle oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you spray it, you just spray
a mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not spray to run off and you have
such a fine thin particle layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can coat very tiny insects and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it works really well on
areophyid mites and even areophyid eggs is
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have just, you know,
billions of these tiny particles that can
[SPEAKER_00]: coat to suffocate the eggs and the the
adult larval stages, all those different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far we've not seen any resistance
to it and that's what I also like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like that once it's dry you can
release beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no residue from it and it doesn't
clog pores or stromata in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we, you know, as long as you use it
according to the label, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to have any issues with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when people accidentally like,
oh my gosh, I applied it at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a four percent rate and I burned my plants
or I sprayed at noon, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epishield is super interesting because
it does have plant botanicals but they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand completely how botanicals
always work as pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the exact mode of actions are
always not worked out on all these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just know they work and they break
down quickly because they are derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and generally aren't very stable
once applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, again, the epishield is interesting
because we don't fully understand all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mode of actions of it but it's the right
combinations of different things that the
[SPEAKER_00]: the trials have been excellent with it on
mites, especially two-spot spider mite,
[SPEAKER_00]: all life stages, and it's been looking
very good on cannabis aphid-2 without
[SPEAKER_00]: having an REI on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, you know, if you have allergy
problems as I do, that doesn't mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: could not have a reaction from some of
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually, in recent years,
because I've done so much work with
[SPEAKER_00]: hibiscus, the years when I go into
hibiscus greenhouses, I tend to now have
[SPEAKER_00]: some respiratory stuff happening because
long-term low-dose exposure to anything
[SPEAKER_00]: can trigger allergens over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they have a zero REI and
don't have the restrictions, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: still, and it still is a pesticide,
and I still would, you know, treat it with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the nice things about those two
products that you touched on too is less
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of phytotoxicity and lower,
you're using much lower concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredients than you might with
other commercially available products on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market, would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making a face of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the things I've seen when
reading about, let me clarify this,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe active ingredient was the wrong
word, the concentrations that you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to spray from what I've seen is much
lower, and I'm getting this from reading
[SPEAKER_01]: on the BioWorks website, with a product
like Epishield than some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available products.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you phrase that better than I
just did?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like other things, you can buy
different things in different
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations and generally big ag,
buy stuff more concentrated and dilute it
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeowners' pesticides are generally more
dilute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you mix up super concentrated
things and you mess it up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be disastrous because those are so
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes dealing with more dilute things
are easier for mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I was getting at is the
concentration needed for efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Epi, yes, so Epishield, the way the
product is made, it takes a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient to see the results than
you would with Sulfoile X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfoile X, typically you're at a one to
two percent active ingredient per set
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a hundred gallons of water,
you're gonna add one to two gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfoile X into it and you're gonna see
efficacy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the active ingredients in
Epishield, its rate is 0.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a lot less of it in order to
see efficacy when you mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concern I have with that is if you're
a home grower or doing small amounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna mix up one gallon,
if you get your rate just slightly off,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be a huge mistake and can then
cause burn because you are putting out too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfoile X, again, you've got more wiggle
room on mistakes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why if you go by BioWorks
booths at trade shows, they're providing
[SPEAKER_00]: syringes to help measure because if you're
trying to pour out a tablespoon or a
[SPEAKER_00]: teaspoon, I do this because I do a lot of
candy making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pour cinnamon oil into a spoon and they
pour it out and I'm like, how much is
[SPEAKER_00]: really staying behind and is stuck to that
spoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because are you getting that full amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I think the syringes are
a much better way to measure for a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower or anybody that's mixing up
anything under 10 gallons of product
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would be very easy to make a
mistake on the Epishield and burn your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, doing the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cannabis growers, stop contacting
me, asking me to figure out your rates for
[SPEAKER_00]: small amounts for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Math is not one of my strongest points.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioWorks for their products does have a
rate calculator on their website that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put in the product you're using and
how much you want to make and it can help
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also today with AI and all that stuff,
they can easily do your rates for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the Epishield, again,
a little more because more is better is
[SPEAKER_00]: not good in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to stay with that
recommended labeled rate for that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my head, what I was thinking of with
my comment about concentrations was less
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing Sufoil and Epishield,
but comparing Epishield and Sufoil to
[SPEAKER_01]: other commercially available products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less with Epishield, a lower concentration
of final applied product that you're less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to see compared to other botanical
25B products on the market that don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: as much research around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're less likely to see phytotoxicity or
other issues and still get the efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're putting out less AI,
active ingredients, not artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence, but you're putting out less
active ingredient and still getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: results for a good price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
money matters on the cost of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people, when they look at
the cost of Epishield, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my gosh, it's a tiny bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to realize that the rates
you're going out at are very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't take as much chemistry
to kill because of the not completely
[SPEAKER_00]: understood ways it kills compared to an
oil or even a soap that you need a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage to smother and activate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think when it comes to these
plant botanical based products,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Epishield is going to take over
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the one standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a really, really good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one thing it's not as effective with,
as I understand it, is with thrips that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pupating inside the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making faces at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making faces at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good because I am not an expert
here and I'm learning myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I understand it, thrips can lay eggs
inside of the leaf tissue of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they emerge, there is some
efficacy with stuff oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't get that efficacy with
Epishield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now please correct me if I'm wrong on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Epishield was originally, the market
was going to be a miticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the focus was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the product's been used,
we've seen activity on other insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it's like, wait a minute,
you know, it's knocking back if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thrips, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most, not all thrips, but most thrips do
lay their eggs inside of plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Western flower thrips, onion thrips,
echinothrips, parvy spinous, they lay
[SPEAKER_00]: their eggs in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there has been some new information
and I feel like a dumbass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't know this and apparently
there was some research done in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at stuff oil eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did find, and I'm guessing this
didn't get published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our buddy Mr. MB over there is the one
who told me about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, how do you not know
this, Suzanne?
[SPEAKER_00]: They found with stuff oil, they were able
to kill about 50% of Western flower thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is because when insects lay their eggs
inside a plant tissue, and if you come to
[SPEAKER_00]: my presentations, you know, I've got
videos of like Oreos inserting their eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave the tiniest bit of the eggs
sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the air exchange is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're respirating through that little
tip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put an oil over it,
it's suffocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It suffocates the eggs just the same way
as if an egg is laid on a plant surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and you cover it with an oil, it will
suffocate it because they do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: respirate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some newer information that the
stuff oil can, and again, the work was
[SPEAKER_00]: only done on Western flower thrips,
which, you know, we generally do not find
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if they have done any of
the work looking at egg efficacy with
[SPEAKER_00]: EpiShield.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is leaning towards no,
because I don't think it's as much as a
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocation mode of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of a chemical, you know,
I don't want to say akin to pyrethrins,
[SPEAKER_00]: but something's happening with those
botanicals in there and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think they know because they
haven't looked at it because for years
[SPEAKER_00]: we've always said, you know, no pesticides
kill Western flower thrips eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then all of a sudden, boop,
wait a minute, no, oils can kill like 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after they do hatch, and I think where
you're going for, not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I was going, actually,
because I talked to Michael two weeks ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and he explained this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't, the pupa is not in the
leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the thrips species,
some drop to the soil to pupate,
[SPEAKER_00]: others pupate on a leaf surface,
but they don't go back into the tissue to
[SPEAKER_00]: pupate.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screwed it up, but I was close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one word, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate the correction,
because that's how I learned to.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, with thrips, one of the
things that Brandon shared with me from
[SPEAKER_01]: from one of your workshops was that our
webinars was that you're seeing a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: incidence or primarily onion thrips now in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always found always onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so some of our management options
should not be based around Western flower
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or lifecycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out online, a lot of people talk
about Western flower thrips in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's because they're not doing
their due diligence, collecting samples
[SPEAKER_00]: and identifying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to say you cannot find
Western flower thrips in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I have not gotten a Western flower
thrips sample from a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found other thrips species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just had, you know, you were
mentioning before about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've always got interesting stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just had a thing not too long
ago with somebody had another consultant
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consultant told him they had Western
flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote him this whole thing about
managing Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in behind this other person in his
facility and immediately I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are weird thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were absolutely they weren't even
close to being Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so Western flower thrips and onion
thrips, you almost have to put them under
[SPEAKER_00]: a microscope and slide mount them to tell
them apart because you have to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: positions of the hairs on the pronotum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look at the sill eye color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the spots on the top of their
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to count in tenal segments and
you have to do all that to tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are just doing quick looks
and doing quick picture matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I could understand where
people would get onion thrips and Western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this thrips wasn't even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to reach out for help because I
could only get it to genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a species that hasn't even been
really described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last report of it was in the
1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my point is on on the thrips is you
have to do your due diligence and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: which one it is so that you can put a
better management program together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true ornamentals, vegetables,
cannabis, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because onion thrips and Western flower
thrips do have different chemistries that
[SPEAKER_00]: work on them differently because of
resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology between onion thrips and
Western flower thrips are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you start getting into a kind of
thrips and this other thrips species,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not the same biologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just you know, you got to stop
guessing and you've got to stop matching
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of just people's quick pictures
online because you're going to you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get yourself into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already getting run out of time
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few other questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just wanted to skip to do you have
any other sort of stories of common
[SPEAKER_01]: misidentifications or where these improper
application rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know you and I have talked off
air and you've talked about how like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people will work with
consultants or a third party distributor
[SPEAKER_01]: of beneficials like myself that supplies,
you know, we sell bio bee insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and they might prescribe
rates that are wildly too high or too low
[SPEAKER_01]: to get control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people may be wasting money or they may
be spending money, but not enough to get
[SPEAKER_01]: actual control based on the size of their
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the problem with the rates is if
somebody calls me and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you know, I've got two spot spider
mites and I want to control a persimilus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's there's not an easy answer
because is a propagation where your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is an inch tall or are they 10 foot palm
trees?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so rates can be all across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know companies try to put out a
basic middle of the road kind of rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really if if you just call
somebody and they don't ask you more
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, what you're spacing,
how tall the crops, even leaf texture can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about spider mites like in
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilus really struggle to get through
those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to up your rates of
persimilus and tomatoes compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical foliage because you have that
smooth leaf surface where they can run
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like ice skating for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of variables that go into
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it's important to talk
with somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does not have to be me,
but talk with somebody that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: understands these systems and,
you know, takes the time to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: To figure out what the right rate for what
you're going to need is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to home grows,
homeowners, you have five or six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can afford to put out insane numbers
of mites because even like persimilus,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the smallest they come in really
is like 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that covers a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you're talking maybe 15
bucks, you know, so a homeowner is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can afford that for my commercial
growers when we need to treat like 50
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like have to get the numbers
exactly right because if not, it gets very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these variables that go in
to making rate recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I really, you know,
working with a lot of bug people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, the guys from BioB,
guys from Beneficial Insectary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Copert, BioBest, you know,
of all these different companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of their people have had a better
experience and that can take the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: help put those better rates together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did see happening is when cannabis
legalization happened, there were some
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrupulous people that are like,
well, cannabis don't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were selling them ridiculous
rates of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was insane and in charging
crazy prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for what my growers are paying 14
cents for, I saw growers paying $2,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers paying $2 for which I
just have zero tolerance for that kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gouging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the cannabis growers have
become more educated on bios and even
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries and how to purchase and
they're buying for more traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers or they're getting better
pricing these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where pesticides, the label is the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rates are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio rates are very subjective and you
really need, if you're new, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with somebody that can help guide you
on the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, there's a lot of variables
that go into making these rate decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to do one quick shameless
plug because we do work with BioB and BioB
[SPEAKER_01]: is a partnership direct from Insectary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have situations with like a
facility or someone you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're not the only one that can
do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, you can't do this for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't afford to have Suzanne
come out, one of the resources that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: have is Kelly Vance and Saul Alba with
BioB, both excellent technical advisors
[SPEAKER_01]: and friends of Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been great to be able to use
them as resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least with helping our company and
other companies should have someone
[SPEAKER_01]: similar or something similar that would
allow you to get better dialed rates for
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing in your facility or even
in your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just are good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him a long time and he's a
real, I mean, Saul's awesome too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know Kelly much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him a lot longer and I'm always
proud of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to walk into a greenhouse with
Kelly next to me because he's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is, you know, he was a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows he's been in your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he doesn't want to be taken
advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't take advantage of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're listening to the podcast and
you'd like to know more about insects or
[SPEAKER_01]: get in touch with these guys as well,
please don't hesitate to reach out to me
[SPEAKER_01]: directly on behalf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to make that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on, last question of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you get back to your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common misidentifications that you see in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of times people will at least
online say like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out it's like a mold mite
that may have been introduced when they
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced beneficials or another one
would be springtails that I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are not necessarily of
considered pests within your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis growers have gotten a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've saved on my computer that in the
early days of legalization, somebody put
[SPEAKER_00]: out this ID manual and for their fungus
snap picture, they had a winged aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that started everybody off
onto the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the wrong footing, because people were
trying to be helpful, but they put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of misidentification and there's still
a lot of bad ID photos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures of persimilis that are
actually velvet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, again, I think the growers
have gotten better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've learned from coming to classes,
whether it be my classes or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing talks from, again, like Kelly or
Steven authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less misidentification,
but there is still confusion between
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats and winged root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broad mites and area phyid mites sometimes
can be a little confusing for growers if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have enough magnification to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think another thing that
periodically comes up, and it's not a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, but they're concerned, is insects
from outside flying in and then flying up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the lights and then dying and then
falling back onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that a handful of times now where
people think they're these weird insects
[SPEAKER_00]: on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, excuse me, they're typically some
kind of midge that have come from some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh water that got sucked in some vent
somewhere and they come in and die,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because of the trichomes, they stick
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those can be mistaken sometimes for
fungus gnats, but you have to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the venation on the wings to be
able to tell these different species
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do overall, I mean, I think the
cannabis growers are getting smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a really good job of getting
educated but just make sure you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: education from good sources because
there's still a lot of bad information out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet and the stuff on the
internet just never goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note of bad information,
one last friendly reminder to not buy
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, please don't support
the companies that are sending them for
[SPEAKER_01]: free with their product or selling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are a few, there is some
commercially-reared ladybirds available
[SPEAKER_01]: now, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's rare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that they're rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's they're expensive because they have
to rear them, which I'm waiting to see on
[SPEAKER_00]: the permits, but we may have some other
ladybird species available on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: More to report on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, which this is kind of important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for ladybug
alternatives, Micromus, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: brown lace wings, beneficial insectary and
applied binomics now have permits for the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it's a, it's not a new
species to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here already in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that they have the permits to sell
them here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit state-by-state
basis, so you have to check to see if they
[SPEAKER_00]: are available in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why brown lace wings are interesting
is they are as their cousins, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use that usefully to try to put in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like cousins to a green
lace wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they the difference is brown lace
wings as adults are predatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green lace wings as adults are not
predatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with brown lace wings, not only do you
get the larvae feeding, you get adults
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding and the adults fly around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit, the wings are a
little bit, I don't know how to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they're like not as long and narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little shorter and fatter where
their larval stages are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and skinnier than green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really hope with these is we'll
be able to release some of the adults out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to fly around in crops and
they are excellent aphid predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping with their size,
because they are larger, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't get stuck in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's a chance
they could get stuck in your buds just
[SPEAKER_00]: like ladybirds could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're big enough that you could,
you know, remove them easily because of
[SPEAKER_00]: their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also may be something that we'll
want to use earlier in the crop cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: help manage foliar aphid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all, it's kind of new on using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, I've got one trial going on
botanical plants at a botanical garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a test there because they've
got birds in the area and so they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing some trials now with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had any of my cannabis growers
use them yet, but I'm hoping we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hoping for a cannabis grower to
have problems, but waiting for an outbreak
[SPEAKER_00]: of either cotton melon aphid or cannabis
aphid to see if we release some adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well they'll do in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the drawbacks is there's almost
zero information on pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility, where there seems to be a
lot more information on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green lace wings and other
commercially reared beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: since this is so new, there's not much
information available on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the permits have come through now
for anistis, which is the whirly gig mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outside during the summertime
and you like look down on the sidewalk and
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a mite running in circle crazy
patterns, that's the whirly gig mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find them in Florida all the time on
hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes find them in trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a larger predatory mite that looks
more like a crab, but applied binomics did
[SPEAKER_00]: get the permit for them to come into not
every state, but certain states in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're setting up some trials
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally going to be more of an
aphid predator, even though they can feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concerning thing about this one is it
is very non-selective, and it will eat
[SPEAKER_00]: your predators just as much as it would
eat your pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it eats your other beneficials to
maintain its own population, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of okay with that as long as
they're controlling the other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, zero pesticide compatibility
information, and it's still so new that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really, is it going to be happy on
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be happy on tropical
foliage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to, you know, trial and test all
this stuff to see how it's going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing that there's new stuff
coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those, just to go back to the
ladybugs, ladybirds, the reason we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be buying them is because they're
wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can spread disease to native
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same species, but remember,
just like cannabis has different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ladybird beetles, even though it's a
species, because it's hypodemia
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence, and you know, if you're in
Virginia, you're like, oh, hypodemia
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a different strain of hypodemia
convergence that is on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as science goes on,
and there's more molecular work and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and all that, happening,
you know, we're going to understand more
[SPEAKER_00]: how we need, you know, basically more
taxonomic levels breaking down even
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we do have subspecies
and things like that, but we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to understand it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I always relate to plants,
you know, Acer rubrum, red maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones growing in Maine and the ones
growing in Florida, those are not the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't dig that one up from Maine and
send it to Florida and the Florida one and
[SPEAKER_00]: send it to Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we definitely have to think about that
with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Bavaria bassiana,
now you have the strains of Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the ANT strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the GHA strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same when you're getting into insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercially, there are several different
persimilis strains on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytosilus persimilis is not phytosilus
persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some very interesting research
done by a friend of mine where she
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looked at cannibalism rates
between the different commercial strains
[SPEAKER_00]: of persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually different
cannibalism rates between the different
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies, which are basically different
strains or cultivars to put into plant
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't aware that that applied with
insects as well as with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think of it from a microbial
perspective, like mycorrhizal inoculants,
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizophagus irregularis is not the same
from different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one particular spray may offer better
drought resistance, may be able to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: in a different range of abiotic conditions
than another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, trying one, if it doesn't work,
doesn't mean that mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't work in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just may mean that you need to try a
different strain out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like the same could be said
for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing with the insects is,
I mean, the damage is kind of done because
[SPEAKER_00]: of everybody buying them and shipping them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back, if you go back into the 90s,
back when I actually sold beneficials,
[SPEAKER_00]: we used to sell one of our, one of our
native species, comium macula maculata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually had, they sold different
strains of it, or different cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever term you want to use for
association, but depending on what part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the country you were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there was like a west coast one,
and there was an east coast one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you were in Pennsylvania,
you'd get the east coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in California, you get the west
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had actually different colonies to
have the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've just, and now it's a hot mess
from all the plants moving around,
[SPEAKER_00]: people moving bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, the whole roly-poly thing,
you know, with all the hobby trading and
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that, you know, it's going to be
hard to even track any of all this because
[SPEAKER_00]: humans have just moved all this stuff
around without a thought or a care,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of the environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what you're saying is we
don't know what the ecological impact may
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've made this mistake in the past
with introducing species to a new
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and causing problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of Hawaii as a great example of
that, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, Hawaii is a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Florida, Florida gets one new invasive
a month, I think is the current going
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is like everybody knows
about, you know, the problem with like the
[SPEAKER_00]: iguanas in Florida, and everybody knows
about the problem with pythons in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're big, and it's very easy to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the insect stuff and even microbial
stuff, we don't see it so directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't think about how harmful it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of these things that I think
one of these times something bad is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen, and it's going to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though everybody's intentions are
good, people need to stop and think about
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're sourcing all this stuff
from, and should it be here or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, a lot of mistakes were made early
on with moving stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cane toads released in
Florida for control of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sugar cane, big mistake, again,
happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always compare it to medical science
because medical science, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we had our last, the Spanish flu,
our last big world pandemic problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were bloodletting, giving whiskey
enemas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean we throw all medical
science out and don't do it because they
[SPEAKER_00]: made mistakes years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn from it and try not to repeat
those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, when it comes to the
insects and the other arthropods and
[SPEAKER_00]: things and microbes, since it's so small,
we don't see it the same way we do as with
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, I've got mice in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go buy some cheetahs from
Africa and release them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would think to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's weird why people aren't concerned
as much about moving arthropods around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the government is, but not growers
because a lot of, I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal movement of arthropods in this
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these more exotic species of
isopods probably are not legal to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: just because of the risk of them getting
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what the ecological
implications are, but also at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, the government doesn't have the
capacity to really enforce or regulate as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as they probably should for this sort
of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't have the manpower to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to move the isopods around,
you do have to have permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just ship them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a permitting process involved,
just like with the commercial beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, persimilis, cucumeras,
those things, they're permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is all regulated by the USDA to
make sure people aren't moving invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the pet trade of these other
arthropods, there's all these shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go buy stuff at and this,
you know, it's just, there's not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the manpower to regulate
all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're setting ourselves up for
some serious problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to stop this stuff is you
know, make sure if you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: something, do you have the right permits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this legal for me to buy and be a
better human?
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be like, oh, the government's
just, you know, trying to control us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why this stuff is in
place to prevent these major problems
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had with invasives in the past and
be a better human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about the impact down the road
of what you're doing, not just what's
[SPEAKER_00]: right in front of your face today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne, I enjoyed our conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always learn something new every time we
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mark that calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can come.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll both be there, along with a bunch of
other folks.
