[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some exciting news to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've finally been able to release two
white papers that are now available to
[SPEAKER_00]: read and download on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one looks at a comparison of
living soil methodologies in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health and yield in a controlled
environment for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this trial, three different living soil
recipes were tested and then put under
[SPEAKER_00]: fluence lighting in a controlled room and
yield was documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other white paper looks at a cost
analysis of living soil cultivation at
[SPEAKER_00]: different yields in comparison to the
costs of more conventional methods like
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients or hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get some feedback from
growers on these white papers and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: people will go on the website and check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to our front page, click on blog
and it's the first two articles on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping this will spark more discussion
and research into this methodology as a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable way of cultivating cannabis in
controlled environments and also get some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to attempt similar experiments to
replicate the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Sarah Pelkofer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah grew up in a small town in Northern
California in the olive growing capital of
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got her BA in environmental studies
from UC Santa Barbara and worked for years
[SPEAKER_00]: for a private environmental consulting
firm, writing environmental impact reports
[SPEAKER_00]: and statements and creating remediation
plans for superfund sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: She then moved over to Switzerland to get
a master's degree from the department of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary biology and environmental
studies at the University of Zurich,
[SPEAKER_00]: studying and publishing work on the
importance of urban gardens as habitat for
[SPEAKER_00]: solitary nesting bees and wasps while
starting a microbrewery to pay for her
[SPEAKER_00]: tuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: After she completed her PhD in plant
science and policy at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Zurich, studying plant soil interactions
and publishing her own work on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity and the stability of
ecosystem functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: During her PhD, she was lucky enough to be
able to travel around the world to share
[SPEAKER_00]: the results of her years of research with
other researchers and scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah wanted to bring this knowledge about
the crucial state of soil biodiversity to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she left academia and started the
company Microculture in Seattle in 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: under which she designed the microbial
inoculant plant probiotics with the
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation to empower all levels of
gardeners to easily start to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: own soil back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wanted to talk a little bit about
your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a really interesting academic
background relating to everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary biology to environmental
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just tell me a little bit about
yourself here to start off the podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it took me a while to find my
direction after I grew up in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California in a small farming town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I finally went to school,
I had no idea what direction I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually I was kind of it just went
towards environmental science because I
[SPEAKER_01]: found that there was just we were just
seeing so many problems in the world and
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed like a good way to try and make
an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into environmental science as an
undergrad and I started I was doing like a
[SPEAKER_01]: geography minor with an environmental
science major.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from after I graduated with my
undergraduate degree, I went into
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental consulting and started
working on super fun sites and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impact reports for new
construction sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was all pretty it felt like
a big downer because it was just just a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of degradation in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided that I didn't feel like I
was making a big enough impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to go back to school again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found a great evolutionary biology
program at the University of Zurich in
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who doesn't want to live in
Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to go there and started
studying wild bees and wasps in urban
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking at how how these
they had these these kind of urban gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like little plots of land that you
can rent and have your own little garden
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was studying how how important these
these gardens were for acting as a habitat
[SPEAKER_01]: for for bees and wasps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty cool because we found
that these little tiny gardens that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to have they weren't actually like a
ton of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very, very small, completely
surrounded with, you know, high rise
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were actually acting as a really
important habitat for for bees and wasps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had even more diversity in them
of different species than than were out in
[SPEAKER_01]: in agricultural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a pretty like impactful study in
terms of talking to the city and telling
[SPEAKER_01]: them to kind of preserve these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, I mean, I was spending a
lot of time in in the garden in these
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking at also how the
diversity of bees and wasps was also
[SPEAKER_01]: related to the diversity of what was in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was looking at a lot of plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and as my master's degree finished,
I got the opportunity to stay to do a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: and decided to stay for that and ended up
studying biodiversity underground and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that was related to biodiversity above
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with my work, I was looking at how
biodiversity affects how plants grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking at, you know,
when I say functioning of an ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about the carbon
sequestration, nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: how like how well the the plants are able
to grow like biomass production and
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition and like several different
functions, like basically trying to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the functionality of the system as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we called it multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are finding that the more diversity
that you had living in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more diverse, excuse me, the more the
better functioning the above ground system
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also the more novel part of my
studies was that we looked at the
[SPEAKER_01]: stability of that ecosystem functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able to find that systems
that had more soil biodiversity actually
[SPEAKER_01]: had greater stability in the ecosystem
functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was kind of like a really like
it was really like it it backed up
[SPEAKER_01]: previous work showing that that there is
this relationship between biodiversity and
[SPEAKER_01]: the functioning of a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also found that the biodiversity is
great for stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really kind of gave like a good a
good background for for saying that we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to preserve soil biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's and it's it is really important
for not just the underground, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: above ground systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after like finding all of that stuff
out and my PhD was coming to a close,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to figure out, do I want to stay in
academia and keep spreading the word in
[SPEAKER_01]: academia and keep building on this
research about soil biodiversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I want to go some other direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided that I felt like with my
results, it seems obvious within the
[SPEAKER_01]: academic community that this is the way
things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't wasn't really translated
into the public eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured that, you know, soil
biodiversity, it needs to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there it wasn't really like there was
it just needed to be told to the people
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow in a better way, because
scientists and the public just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: have this lack of communication sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to start a business called
microculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make a microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of gives people an easy way to
bring their soil back to life and improve
[SPEAKER_01]: their soil biodiversity in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a major change of hats going
from academia into the public sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of a general story of how
I got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful that you're local,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the opportunity to meet with you
in person, which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we've talked off air about
quite a bit of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really impressed me with your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microbial based products on the
market now, as the industry is realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of microbes and this this
concept of plant probiotics that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit more before
we get into this concept of biodiversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have some thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit more about
what is in your plant probiotics product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have when I say we, it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always talk in the we sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a mixture of three different
kinds of bacteria and four different kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of listed fungi that the bacteria are all
their bacillus species and the fungi are
[SPEAKER_01]: glomus species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up with this formula because I
wanted to make the product kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: universally applicable to different
gardens and different growing
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are species that I studied in in
my graduate work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always seem to be present in
healthy, really healthy systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're they're naturally occurring
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a healthy, natural soil,
like if you go out, you know, into any
[SPEAKER_01]: grassland or forest, you're going to find
these species there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are the species that tend to be
lacking in, you know, the soils that we
[SPEAKER_01]: process a lot bag soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you basically if you're adding a
lot of fertilizer and chemicals to your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you're going to be pretty
efficiently killing these guys off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are the ones that that really
help the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they really form a symbiotic
relationship with the roots of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have these different species in the
mixture, along with a few starter
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients of kelp, amino and humic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys are there to kind of help
the kickstart the bacteria and fungi once
[SPEAKER_01]: they're activated, because the product is
in a powder form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dry powder form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're in this suspended state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you add water to the system,
they're activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this kelp and amino acid,
amino and humic acids come in and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: give them some food to start out with
before they are able to seek out the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and pair up with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I found out about you from Stephanie
down at Fire Cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been using your product and she's a
good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to give her a shout out and some
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's sort of how I found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized you were local and you
and I had some conversations offline and
[SPEAKER_00]: you gave me a sample, which I threw under
the microscope and tested the problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these, like you said,
suspended microbial products is they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not motile bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not very exciting under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did see an increase in bacterial
biomass over time when I added distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: water and a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew there was something alive in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't a lot of fun to look at
under the microscope, like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more exciting things like the fungal
hyphae and flagellates and motile
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you did was you took
your background in academia and looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific species that you had
researched or found to be most effective
[SPEAKER_00]: and then and then put them into this
product, essentially is what is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also I think I was kind of
funneled as well by by the market and
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of different laboratories,
reliable laboratories in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, because I wanted to have a solid
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's there are tons of
suppliers out there that can they say they
[SPEAKER_01]: can give you whatever species you want,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them are overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just is is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't have a lot of faith in in
in the viability of the species that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, and I didn't want to overrun the
system as well with too many species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just kind of a good start for
for the mixture that I have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know you're looking to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I talked about some other
microbes that you were excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully getting into a commercial
production with your products down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road, which I love that you're open to
that and it's constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing, though, you had mentioned
off air that you do some testing back with
[SPEAKER_00]: your old university on the viability of
your product on a on a fairly regular
[SPEAKER_00]: basis to make sure that you are providing
the microbial levels that you're claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: on the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I sent some samples back to
Switzerland and I luckily I have my old
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues, a lot of them are on my
scientific advisory board with
[SPEAKER_01]: microculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to banter back and forth with
them about ideas and just kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: they have better access to the current
state of the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as things are evolving and we're
discovering new things, which we are all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time because, you know, science is or
excuse me, soil is really like the great
[SPEAKER_01]: frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know so little about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to have them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with their hand in academia and being
able to have access to the journals and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the current science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sent samples back to them and
they've incorporated them into some
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also have the DNA extraction
laboratory and equipment to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have contract or I have samples
going out to some local labs here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing the fungal spore
analysis for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really important to kind
of just constantly keep testing your
[SPEAKER_01]: product because it's just it's a really
challenging medium because we can't see
[SPEAKER_01]: the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to have quality control
visibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to, you know, send stuff
out and you have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's important to have these
to be able to know that you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: viability that is listed on your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least at the minimum concentrations
that are that are on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's it's yeah, it's money out of
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in the end, you're going to
have a better product that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable, that's going to give more
reliable results to your clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one thing that a lot of growers
don't realize is that with microbial based
[SPEAKER_00]: products, you I believe you have to submit
an initial test that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations to support what you're
putting on your label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, there's there's very
limited testing done by the state to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually ensure that the levels that
you're claiming on the package are really
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't know how long it's been
sitting on a shelf, how it's been stored
[SPEAKER_00]: by whatever company is distributing or
selling that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets really, really convoluted,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only state that I know that's actually
done any of this testing is the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest if you haven't signed up for
their fertilizer and pesticide alerts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that everyone should go do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a free email service that they
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just give them your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they did a study or some
testing back in, I want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 or 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that the levels were quite
different based on what the claims were on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something for people to be aware
of when they're looking at comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial based products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's important that there is
that there should be you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a shelf life listed on the
product, because it's I think that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: that's safe for the producer and for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yeah, then because microbes,
they want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, fungi and bacteria, they want to
grow if they get any access to sugars or
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a suspended form, like what I have
in a dry powder form, if it gets access to
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of moisture, they're going to
grow and things are going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's the beauty of fungi and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's they're constantly changing,
evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you're going to be selling
a product with X number of species listed
[SPEAKER_01]: at X concentrations, you have to be able
to kind of stand behind that.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to I want to kind of change
directions here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned biodiversity early on in
our conversation and how that was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the findings that you had in your in your
university study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't actually talked to you about
this yet, but I recently went to Chicago
[SPEAKER_00]: for Photo X, which is a a conference put
on by Fluence Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a lot of fun and a lot of really
good studies are presented there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to share some of that later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, I'm sitting in
on the plane and this guy next to me is
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a journal article on how how
earthworms can be used to in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular earthworm species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I leaned over to him and asked him
if he was a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, I got I got seated
probably next to the only soil scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plane, which was which was
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's he was a German professor who
looked at they were measuring in a given
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find they may have 20 different
species of earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a certain amount, you know,
a certain concentration of those
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to use that data for a
given area to to see as an early indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: of the quality of that soil or so to be
able to address soil problems before they
[SPEAKER_00]: got too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially using the earthworm as an
early indicator species, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was taking that and he said
that they were they found some farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: were taking earthworm castings,
of course, or that have actual viable
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworm species in it and then planting
them into fields that were degraded,
[SPEAKER_00]: that didn't have good biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these cores, they were able to move,
I believe it was three meters per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd end up with this like
circular patch around that core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a company doing this now in
Germany and coring these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd see much healthier plants,
biodiversity, all of these benefits from
[SPEAKER_00]: this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just something I wanted to
share that happened happened to me this
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I got to this conference,
it was very different because one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I found with university professors
is they want everything to be controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they want to run a study,
they want to control every variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenge there is when you look
at organics and what we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: with biodiversity, you really you really
can't so that a lot of the studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the studies with organics may add
too much variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your thoughts are on
that, but it seemed it was difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the academic people there to talk
about organics or to look at organics just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the complexity of the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's one of
the hardest things of working in ecology
[SPEAKER_01]: is you're you're working with these living
systems that have I mean, ecology is like
[SPEAKER_01]: the it's the interlinking of all of these
these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just effects from the light,
the the air and the like all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: gases, the water is just all these
different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's yeah, it's incredibly
difficult to isolate the variables of what
[SPEAKER_01]: what is actually having an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's funny because of my PhD
work, I had access to these incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, we called them eco tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really looked like it did not look
like a natural system at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the best shot we had at trying
to figure out the true effect of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these eco tubes were designed by my
my in German, it's called Dr. Father.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my PhD advisor, Marcel van der
Heiden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are these systems that they're
these, it's these the kind of cylinders
[SPEAKER_01]: with these clear plexiglass glass tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the air and the water going
into the system was filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would we would only add it was
it was of the entire soil medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: only 5% was our treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the soil was actually
sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would add in a 5% inoculant of the
soil biodiversity that we were testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with with all the air and the water
being filtered going in, and trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: basically eliminated the outside
contamination of the different microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that were living in the greenhouse
already, we that was a I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the best systems that I've
seen for for trying to isolate soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's artificial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, you know, some some negatives
from from having such an artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that kind of really what
you're saying is nails nails the
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulty of testing organic systems,
because to have an art, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to really test an organic system,
you have to kind of make a non natural
[SPEAKER_01]: system to to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's incredibly difficult to
isolate the effects and and seeing like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really causing the differences in
your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it you know, it's yes, it's incredibly
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would also say it may limit the
amount of academic interest in studying
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these organic concepts,
too, because it's so much harder to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of trends or conclusions from the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's there's a lot more challenges
like we discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I guess my big takeaway was that it
still felt like at this at this conference
[SPEAKER_00]: that more and more people are pushing for
more conventional agricultural,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, processes or applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we can take some of that
data and then apply it back into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so take some of the things that we're
learning regarding lighting and nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: and then find organic ways to replicate or
or use that information that they're that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along that note, you had sent me this
recent article in Wired.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that you're finding
in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came out on October 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll post these articles on the
podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one is called Farmers Can
Now Buy Designer Microbes to Replace
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to talk a little bit about
what the findings in that article were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was this Berkeley biotech startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Pivot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called Pivot Bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they launched the first and only
nitrogen producing microbial treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: for U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: corn farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're essentially trying to in the
nitrogen fixing bacteria that you normally
[SPEAKER_01]: find in legumes or the fungi and bacteria
that pair up with legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to do it paired up with
corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is just it's unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's incredible to think that we
have the science to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they use like a bunch of gene editing
tools to re rewire the gene expression of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bacteria that they found that they
found them in nature paired up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots of some some corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But normally what happens in these
agricultural systems is when you when you
[SPEAKER_01]: throw fertilizer onto the system,
you basically shut off the responses of
[SPEAKER_01]: these these nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they they basically get the like the
plant sends out the signal that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: enough nutrients coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bacteria doesn't get the signal
to pair up with the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've kind of switched the genes to
to make these bacteria keep on pairing
[SPEAKER_01]: with with the plant, even when there is
fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the kind of idea of it is that the
farmer can keep adding fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also have the benefits of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are there, increasing the efficiency
of the uptake of of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's yes, it's crazy to think that
we've we're already at a point where this
[SPEAKER_01]: is being put onto the market pretty
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now, knowing with your background,
I guess, how much concern do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: there is for the for the addition of,
you know, essentially these gene edited
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes or even non native microbes to
various soils in terms of their effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It it appears from what I see that you
just don't see a lot of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: persistence, which is why a lot of these
are being applied over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what what sort of findings have you
seen along that along those lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think nature is going to sort out
the populations itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if these guys don't if they're
not fitting into the niche space of a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular environment, they're they're
just not going to be able to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, other bacteria are
going to be able to out compete them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so it's it's I don't know,
like what kind of guarantee this company
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to give for the viability of this
kind of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they if they're expecting people to
probably have to reapply every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's I don't think they can
give any kind of guarantee of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness of this kind of product,
because everyone's system is different and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have a completely
different soil microbial community
[SPEAKER_01]: underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going they're going to the species
that are living there are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine whether or not this one
survives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's it's going to be really
interesting to see like how how this all
[SPEAKER_01]: works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's terrible to think that
even when you put these gene edited
[SPEAKER_01]: species into the ground, you're kind of I
don't know, it's it's a little too hand
[SPEAKER_01]: like human hand heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, I think there's probably
should be more tests done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you think of like the worst case
is you're kind of growing a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's somehow if this species really
like takes off, it could take over and
[SPEAKER_01]: kill off native species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we just don't understand soil
biodiversity enough to to really be
[SPEAKER_01]: messing with it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll see where it goes,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may be playing God in a sense and
releasing essentially a lion in a petting
[SPEAKER_00]: zoo, potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had an interesting
conversation with this German professor on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plane about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was asking him about, you know,
essentially the exact same question I
[SPEAKER_00]: asked you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me a response and I was like,
well, you know, you study earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworms are not native to North
America, but they have a ton of benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're all glad they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, his colleagues in
Canada, actually, there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: species of plants that require a mulch,
a heavy mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earthworms are breaking it down
too quickly, causing these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to really suffer and potentially go
extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, something that I think I've
always thought of as a positive addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to our soils when we talk about worms does
have non-target organism effects that may
[SPEAKER_00]: or may not be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, some some work of my
colleagues in Switzerland and they found
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of the biggest differences in
the effects on the above ground community
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil biodiversity, when they looked at
the soil community, they found that the
[SPEAKER_01]: systems that did the best actually had
populations of more rare species in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're thinking that maybe the reason
that these systems did better with the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher biodiversity was actually more of
an effect of the rare species in the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, maybe these rare
species, there's something that we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on preserving more rather than just
finding one species that does X really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we add a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you need to kind of focus on the
entire community, not not just
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one difference I do want to point out
between, you know, your product and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this particular study is that
your product contains bacteria and fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: that are already found essentially
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're native to, I think, all soils as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to point that out for people
because I want to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we're distinguishing the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to move on to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one other study I wanted to talk
about with you that Stephanie actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sent over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one I thought was really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out on July 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2006, this article out of the
University of California, Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: entitled Fertilizer Destroys Plants
Microbiome's Ability to Protect Against
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know she sent it to you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to talk about that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a really interesting study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they found that that when you when
you add fertilizer to the system before
[SPEAKER_01]: before they they threw in it was a
pseudomonas species that causes some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of blight in the tomatoes before applying
that pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they applied fertilizer and they
found that this application of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: negated the protection of that the mic
that the biodiversity normally had for
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting the plant against the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when when when there was fertilizer
applied and they they put the pseudomonas
[SPEAKER_01]: on there, it completely took out the plant
and if they had biodiversity there,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the plant was or they didn't have the
fertilizer application before then the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome was able to protect the system
from the incoming pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it was it was it's a really
interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's just the changing of
the nutrients when you when you throw in
[SPEAKER_01]: this fertilizer into the system,
it really just throws off the balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then I think also that when you
throw on fertilizer, the plant is it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: the signal that it has enough nutrients
and so it doesn't send out the amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: and signals to pair up with with more of
the species underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you're you don't get the
symbiotic pairing with with the good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the bad guys come in,
the system's open and free and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to come in and just munch at the at
their will on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one other really interesting result
from this study was they found the best
[SPEAKER_00]: the most protective community of of
microbes was the lowest application dose
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher they applied the microbial
community, the less plant resistance they
[SPEAKER_00]: got to the diseases that they were they
were adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you initially look at that and you're
like, that's that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it, they're they I
looked at the details of this because that
[SPEAKER_01]: that was just looks strange to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I found that they they only
applied 12 cultural species to the that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what their microbiome was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're manipulated microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only 12 species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only they did the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one week after the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my mind, if if you have more
species that you're throwing in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to take a lot longer than a
week for everyone to kind of get situated
[SPEAKER_01]: and find their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that you have species
trying to they're kind of all battling for
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and getting settled in their new
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't know, I would like to see
how those results would change if they
[SPEAKER_01]: tested later than one week after
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I would I don't know about the
details of what exact species they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, I'd have to I'd have to read
more on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, they took healthy tomatoes and
then cultured 12 bacterial species that
[SPEAKER_00]: they found naturalized and thriving on
these healthy tomatoes and then sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: them onto new tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of explain that to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll I'll post this article on the
podcast page as well so people can read
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you notice if the 12 species came from
the same location?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I didn't see that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw that they took them from
healthy tomatoes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was wondering if maybe they were
coming from different locations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would then indicate they would
probably even be battling more for the new
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just be like a rougher
transition for that first week of the
[SPEAKER_01]: species together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just another thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting because one of the
claims that you hear out of the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea world, which is something I want to
talk to you about next year, is that
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar applications of compost tea provide
aerobic or beneficial microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: directly on the leaf surface of the plant
that will outcompete pathogens for that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether or not that is true,
it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen enough actual research on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compost tea varies so much that it'd
be really hard to draw any conclusions
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sort of goes in, well, in some ways
opposition to this, but also in support of
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of having a healthy microbiome on
your leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's called preemptive
colonization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there's no space in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone's living there and they're
eating up all the resources, there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to be any available for the new
guy coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder for them to colonize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's definitely a valid
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think we should be careful
with foliar applications knowing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: may be increasing the opportunistic
bacteria for disease, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: on our leaves themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be the other conclusion I'd
want to draw from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk a little bit about plant
probiotics versus compost tea and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us sort of an overview on
your thoughts about these differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, compost tea is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you can compost tea,
you should compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to replace compost tea,
but I just think that not everyone has the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, the resources, and the knowledge to
make a really good compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, it takes a lot of trial and
error to get your compost tea right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have the right
temperature, the right nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to figure out the right time for
your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your starter species is dependent on what
you have in there to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a lot of trial and error to
get a really good compost tea going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, plant probiotics is an easier
way to get a lot of the benefits that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get with the compost tea without having to
have all that trial and error time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also without the mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's especially good, I guess,
if you're in an apartment or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't really do a compost tea in your
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could, but yeah, it's just not
as convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant probiotics is kind of a
convenient way to get a lot of the species
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're trying to grow in a good
compost tea, but just have it in a more
[SPEAKER_01]: guaranteed and convenient form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that if you can compost
tea, you should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like the next best thing is a
plant probiotics or of course having your
[SPEAKER_01]: own compost would be even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think when we're talking about
this, we really have to compare,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at all the pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with compost tea or aerated compost
tea, just to be specific here,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of cost associated with
having a good brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as just throwing an
aquarium pump in a bubbler in a bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: then throwing in some compost in a food
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually is a fair bit of science
that goes into designing and using a good
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other challenge with compost tea
is variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are never going to get the exact
same brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you use the exact same water
source, compost source, brewing time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still going to vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the challenges is that
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the risk of potentially
having pathogens in the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think that's a fairly low risk due
to if you're using high quality compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a majority of
beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing along that lines
is one advantage of compost tea is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting functional nutrient cycling,
which is something that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily get with these other microbial
based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, a microbial based product
like yours may help increase nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling once in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of people have moved away
from compost tea just because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's so much that
we just don't know about soil plant
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions in the rhizosphere that even
when people make a less than a year or so
[SPEAKER_00]: of great compost tea, a lot of times
they're still seeing benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've shown me results with your
product where even if you have a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good soil by adding plant probiotics,
you're still seeing an increase in overall
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the major point there is we
don't really understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of better to give the
system more options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without doing too much, obviously,
but letting it kind of sort out what it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs and just giving it a kind of a
buffet option of what to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we've talked about how we can't
really control for every variable with
[SPEAKER_00]: organics and with these trials,
what you could do is take a product like
[SPEAKER_00]: yours and apply it to a few of your plants
in your garden and see how they respond
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the other plants trying to
eliminate as many variables as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would really be an easy way to
determine a cost-benefit analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a microbial product like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can't look at your garden and
say, oh, I'm missing some glomocenter
[SPEAKER_01]: adices in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you got to do a guess and check
and just see side-by-side pod experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely the best way to try and
figure it out, figure out where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: missing your biodiversity, where's your
gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other things are you seeing here
as you've started working with gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers that are using your product or
microbes as an additive into their
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what kind of results are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you've learned from now
that you've had this company for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years in terms of what sort of responses
people are getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they vary quite a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hearing back the same things from
growers or gardeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a lot of reviews from people
that were just like, you saved a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was just totally on its way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried adding different
fertilizers and they thought they had
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that just adding the plant
probiotics really just made the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are finding... I have a guy who
sends me pictures of his roses every year
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's just like, these are the most
beautiful roses I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just a guy who's really into his
roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't design the product for
making roses more beautiful, but it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: great byproduct of plant probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, people are finding they just
have more robust plant communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to resist disease better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to survive through our crazy
droughty summers now better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because when you have a fungal
community that pairs up with the roots of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and it really is like reaching
out and extending the root of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant's gonna be able to get to more
of the water that is existing in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do water, it's gonna be more
effective and more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant's gonna be able to better
survive the hotter, drier days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've gotten a lot of positive
reviews and some people have said,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really do anything for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's because they had a really
great diversity in their soil already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to say why exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not have shown positive effects
on someone's system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they applied it in a wrong way or
something, but yeah, it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a good first stab at trying to
restore your biodiversity in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we just started making a new
shaker jar this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to go over really well with
a lot of people because that's one thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: found is that people really like
convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a shaker jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks kind of like just a little spice
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can take it and use it in house
plants really easily and keep it under the
[SPEAKER_01]: sink and pull it out whenever your plant's
looking a little sad and just sprinkle it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the soil surface and water it in and
bam, you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to go out to your shed
and change out your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a really easy and convenient
way to try and help your plants kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: a more natural way than a lot of other
things that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I found people really like
convenience and they seem to be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with the results in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets me thinking based on this
research that we've already discussed,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think of for, I guess,
best practice around applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes or microbial based products,
whether it's compost tea or your product
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to fertilizer and other
applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think if you can get your soil
community strong and robust and diverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to need to add excess
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unless it's like a really closed
system, then you probably have to if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not restoring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not restoring the nutrients in
your system in any way and you're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out of it constantly, you're
probably going to have to restore it
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, if you have a natural soil
community that's strong and robust,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil microbes are going to do the work
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to add all the
synthetics and the terrible things that
[SPEAKER_01]: have become like the norm and mainstream
that we're all starting to realize are
[SPEAKER_01]: just they're bad for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bad for us, for our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bad for the plant, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bad for the soil community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can kind of steer clear of those if
we have our soil diverse and strong and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, yeah, just try out different
species and different mixes and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: works in your system, see what you're
missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, from that respect, I would say,
yeah, look for like a diverse species list
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're trying something out and then
just see how your system responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about adding additional
mycorrhizal fungus at, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking your product and another
mycoproduct and adding them in at initial
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant, for example, or when cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anyone doing anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's probably the most
effective time to add the product because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really like you're putting it in
right at the root zone when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more of like a basic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungi and the plant root are more
likely to pair up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're asking, like, what's the
difference between two different products
[SPEAKER_01]: or what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know you have some gloma species
in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other ones that are more
that have higher spore counts but may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have that same diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, the ones that we
currently sell are specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizophagous enteraticis or glomis
enteraticis because that is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: researched species of mycorrhizae in
regards to most of the plants that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you already know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just throwing it out there for
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding a higher spore count,
say, of that particular glomis species at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of inoculation, we could add in
your product at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is what I'm getting at as a way of
increasing the overall microbial community
[SPEAKER_00]: or microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, again, it's finding that
missing piece in your garden puzzle
[SPEAKER_01]: because the system is going to
self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if it already has too much
enteraticis, it can only support so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to balance it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, you can add a bunch of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if the spore counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, I think it's just kind of
maybe overkill because as long as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee the successful growth of spores,
you know, a certain baseline of spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to propagate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to fill up your
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even if you start with a low
number, if they have the resources there
[SPEAKER_01]: and the environment is right for them,
they're going to bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just need to have, I would say,
like a minimum there's like a minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: viable number that you should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I don't think necessarily
having a lot more is really going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge difference in your system because
if they can't support them, they'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ultimately, all we really care
about is that we're getting this
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal infection as quickly as
possible when transplanting, because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people, you know, we're talking
about a pretty high value crop here with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and a pretty short growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that done as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research that we talked about
today is showing that maybe higher amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes are not always necessarily
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot more research to
be done on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I have you on the phone,
is there anything else that you'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: share in regards to the future of your
company or the future of sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology and agriculture and
horticulture in general that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, I think for plant
probiotics, you got to just keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_01]: things because I have some ideas in the
works of, you know, expanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding different products, you know,
targeting different plants specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know that there are specific
species that pair up better with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'm trying to constantly
evolve the product, maybe just go for a
[SPEAKER_01]: different, you know, having a line of
products that go for different plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: different targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, in terms of, I think it was Dave
Montgomery who talks about like the fifth
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural revolution that we're in
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, I think it's an
exciting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we are learning how to kind of give
the power back to nature in our growing
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're realizing that, you know,
us interfering and adding plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all these synthetic,
you know, fertilizers and pesticides is
[SPEAKER_01]: not really the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's exciting to see like where
we're going with this kind of encouraging
[SPEAKER_01]: our soil biodiversity and letting nature
do what it does best, which is grow
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's yeah, it's an exciting
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep an eye out on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really interested to see like
where these new biotech companies go with
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to isolate different genes and put
them into the agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been seeing more and more stuff
pop up on endophytic fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microorganisms that actually live
within the plant itself or within the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that might be the next big big
thing here in terms of biologicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's sort of really, really new at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen much research
on that, but it's something that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't read much on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you an article when when we get
off the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but yeah, I really appreciate you
coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that answers all my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to, I guess,
catching up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for giving me the opportunity to be
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll actually I think we have a
delivery coming to your shop today for
[SPEAKER_01]: some plant probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Sarah Pelkofer with Plant
Probiotics.
