[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk a little bit about broad
mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell me about broad mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a while there, they were like
the latest spider mites and everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosing all plant problems as being
broad mites.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I just saw some hemp images that
was like broad mite, broad mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're pretty sure it's actually
herbicide damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: For outdoor production, people have to
remember spray drift is an issue and
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicides drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even had it at my house this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm field up back had sprayed an
herbicide and it damaged all our tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had herbicide damage on our tomatoes,
which looked like broad mite damage
[SPEAKER_01]: because I got all excited thinking,
yes, we've got broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take pictures and videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out to be herbicide damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about the actual life cycle
and identification for a broad mite,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we looking for in a plant in
terms of damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always associated with incorrect me
because I'm probably wrong, but twisted
[SPEAKER_00]: new green growth that's a little bit
lighter than it should be in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're speaking to cannabis,
cannabis actually can have a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: level of broad mites on it before you see
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deal with this in ornamentals and
vegetables too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get a few broad mites feeding on
an impatient and the leaf is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: gnarled and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis actually handles this pest quite
well, not that you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, people don't realize they have
it until they do have really high numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you see that slightly
distorted growth, a little discoloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk by and it's just like,
it just doesn't quite look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you put it under your scope and
you're like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you know you have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being this is a very what we call
cosmopolitan pest, it's probably in every
[SPEAKER_01]: local garden center, coming from every
major greenhouse because it's just been a
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad pest the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, before it hit cannabis,
we've been working on it a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamentals and we've had a lot of trials
and tests and things we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out products like the SufoilX
work extremely well on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That in combination with a predatory mite,
Cucamaris.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of ornamentals now, if it's an
ornamental that we know can get it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just treat them with Cucamaris.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do it as a preventative and it's
basically stopped the problem in
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what you'd want to do then
you're saying is treat the plants early on
[SPEAKER_00]: with something like a SufoilX to knock
back the populations and then follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: with an application of the Cucamaris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Cucamaris are so inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like a bread and butter
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, price is low on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucamaris, being that we know it does
really good on broad mite, it will also
[SPEAKER_01]: feed on a first instar, western flower
thrips, and a few other thrips species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will snack on spider mite eggs because
this is something that's been very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Guinea in patients, we used to have a
lot of spider mite problems on in addition
[SPEAKER_01]: to thrips problems and broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we went to using the Cucamaris
program, we don't have spider mite issues
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore on the New Guineas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that the Cucamaris are stopping
it before it gets started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never recommend Cucamaris to treat
for spider mites if you have a population
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's just one egg here or there and
the Cucamaris find it, there's a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to just feed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, do not use Cucamaris as a control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't email me saying, hey, I heard you
say use Cucamaris to control spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're targeting broad mites,
we're seeing these side benefits of other
[SPEAKER_01]: things that will feed on and can stop
problems before they start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, if you're a
cannabis grower and you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucamaris in your program, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about identifying broad
mites, they're quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't see them with a jeweler's loop
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What identifying characteristics and what
do we need as tools in the garden for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be able to really identify them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 60X magnification is generally where
you need to be around and this is where,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I love my Dynalite because my eyes
are terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have old lady eyeballs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be able to take leaves and sit
with my computer with my Dynalite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this giant big screen and then I can
scan over the leaf surfaces with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynalite and then be able to see things
close up and then take pictures if need
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them for my classes, but for my
growers, they can take pictures and then
[SPEAKER_01]: send them to me if they don't see what
something is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The broad mites, they tend to be a little
clearer on their bodies and the key
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnostic feature we look for are their
eggs because they've got little white dots
[SPEAKER_01]: all over their eggs where spider mite eggs
are larger and they're perfectly round.
[SPEAKER_01]: They almost remind me of golf ball dimples
in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very distinctive eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see those, then we know that that's
a broad mite egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing broad mites do is the
males will pick up and carry the females
[SPEAKER_01]: around so if you see a mite running by and
then there's a female attached to it or it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like two are running along,
then that's broad mite also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing is we're sampling off of
a leaf that's probably new growth and then
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that, flipping it over and using
the Dynalite or a stronger leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's packed to go for my workshop for
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Dynalite I got is wireless and so
you can have your laptop or your phone
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting somewhere a bit away and you don't
have to worry about the cable or cord and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to manipulate the Dynalite a
bit easier to be able to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant canopy and everything if you don't
want to cut leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're just expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but you got to remember,
I'm in a different job than you all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very expensive phase contrast
microscope that would be overkill for any
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the right tools for what
you're doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of broad mites, you mentioned
Cucumeris, you mentioned Sufoil-X.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say if you are under warmer growing
conditions, which often if you're in an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grow, you're not, there is the
option of using the predatory mite
[SPEAKER_01]: Swirsky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say start with Cucumeris and if
you can get it to work, you can save a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you can move into Swirsky,
but generally Swirsky is for a bit warmer
[SPEAKER_01]: of temperatures or if you're fighting
white fly at the same time that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting broad mites because Swirsky will
also feed on white fly eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other oil-based options or
pesticidal sprays that you can use that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: For broad mites besides Sufoil-X?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a very good comfort zone with
that product because I have had lots of my
[SPEAKER_01]: growers using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had any problems with it and we
know it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of other oils, a lot of the
plant botanical based ones, but they get
[SPEAKER_01]: very expensive and there needs to be
testing to prove they work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there has been some testing going
on comparing the different oils and the
[SPEAKER_01]: oils do not all work the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk about somebody else's
research because he's going to publish it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the oils do not work the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different particle sizes and I
know one of the things that I'm getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people are like, well, Sufoil-X,
it's a petroleum product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my argument back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use things like plant
botanical oils to make those botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: oils, how much carbon footprinting and how
much petroleum has to go into growing all
[SPEAKER_01]: those, harvesting all that to process it
to make a small batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you if you actually looked at the
fossil fuel inputs to produce those
[SPEAKER_01]: products, it's more than just using a jug
of the Sufoil because you think about how
[SPEAKER_01]: much of these plants, how much lavender,
how much rosemary, how much all that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to grow to produce these oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of input and a lot of work to
harvest it and do all that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying that when you're looking at a
1% spray rate on some of these products
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's weird because people are okay
with driving their cars and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: gasoline in it, but then they've got this
weird thing about using Sufoil-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting early on in propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dipping our clones or spraying them
with the Sufoil and then introducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumeris hopefully to the crop fairly
early on, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that within a few days, a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as ... I mean, the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how often should we be introducing
Cucumeris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I assume if there's not enough
food, they'll die off and then- Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and this is the other thing that
ornamentals and vegetable guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of spraying every week or every
two weeks, they're releasing bugs every
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not building a population in there
because as you said, there's not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to do constant
introductions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all going to depend on the rates,
your pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you got to work with somebody
that can help you put these programs
[SPEAKER_01]: together because as I'm working around
North America, people's pressures are
[SPEAKER_01]: different in different parts of the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a very cold climate and it's
mid-winter and you get your spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: or broad mite cleaned up, you might not
have to introduce anything else for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of that until it warms up outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in warmer climates in Vegas,
Arizona, Florida, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have constant pressures
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more likely going to have to stay
on a solid program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I guess my last question about broad
mites would be, what happens when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower and you notice that you have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just screwed at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like because you're not spraying
SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you should smack yourself in
the back of your head for letting it get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that point because they didn't just
show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been there for weeks and weeks and
weeks and weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why, again, you've got to be
preventative about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the ornamental and vegetableized
have gotten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In propagation, they just treat everything
like they're going to get problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't get enough Cucumeris out or
Swirsky out in flower onto the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because the application methods would be
just very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd end up with so much carrier on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sachets will not release fast enough
for what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem.
It's a problem.
