[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tav Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: In honor of our 50th episode, I wanted to
get Jeff, our very first podcast guest and
[SPEAKER_02]: old friend, back on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff is the author of the popular teaming
series, teaming with microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: teaming with nutrients, and teaming with
fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff is an extremely respected and popular
national garden writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the former president of the Garden
Writers of America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff has been a good friend now for over a
decade and is a wonderful advocate for
[SPEAKER_02]: organic gardening, compost teas,
and the microbes in our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to have you back on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're an old friend and it's
wonderful to chat with you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never see enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is a poor second
substitute, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's, let's just, let's just start
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talked about a few different
topics off air, but one of the things you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to talk about was rhizophagy,
which is something pretty interesting that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that informed on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we just start right there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizophagy, R-H-I-Z-O-P-H-A-G-E-Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is, or maybe it's just G-Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I stumbled upon,
oh gosh, about probably about 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, a friend of mine in New York sent me
a article about tundra plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of actually ingesting organic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, just as by way of background in
teaming with nutrients, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways is that the microbes in the soil
put a charge on the 17 nutrients that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that, that charge, which enables
the nutrients to get into plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs that charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wrote the book teaming with
microbes, which is about how the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: gets delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then teaming with nutrients,
how it gets into the plant based upon the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web concept that the,
that the exudates that the plant drips out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root system, attracts bacteria and
fungi, that bacteria and fungi attract the
[SPEAKER_00]: protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes who eat the bacteria and fungi
and poop out the excess and feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's all happening right there in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the model that I've
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about seven or eight years ago,
the, this rhizophagy concept came up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was sort of an eye opener because
plants aren't supposed to be able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic molecules that don't have a
charge on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there, there were some pictures of
some tundra plants and they were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, you could think,
okay, they're living in the tundra.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had to adapt for a special way to
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very short growing season,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it turns out is that there appear
to be a set of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what the identification
of this particular set is, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria operate in a different way than
that standard soil food web model.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys go into the marital stem of a
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those brand new cells, you know,
sort of the stem cell area of the root,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go into the tip and when they go in,
they, they, they drop off or lose their
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall and they move into the root
where they are up against the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the cell wall and the plasma lemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this stuff, if you don't know these
words, they're in teaming with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are oxidized and the nutrients
that they contain that the plant wants are
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped out of the shellless bacteria who
then continue to move through the root to
[SPEAKER_00]: the edge of the root where they stimulate
the production and growth of a root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a root hair is just one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves into that single cell out to the
tip of the root hair and pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the soil, putting back on its cell
wall or building a new cell wall and then
[SPEAKER_00]: repeating the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys cycle through the soil,
losing their cell wall inside the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving the plant its nutrients,
moving back outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an unusual new way of plants
getting food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can figure out which bacteria do
it, when they do it, why they do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, we're going to have a new tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me to be able to grow our
favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on the web, there are pictures
of it where they can actually show the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen creates a situation where they can
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can actually show where these
guys are in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just one little guy in the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, there's quite a few of
them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, we've got to back up a
second because I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand that there are two ways
to move through a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're going into a root,
you can go into the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into the cell, you're inside
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move from that cell to another
cell to any other cell on the plant by
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, that's called the simplistic
pathway, but you could also go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the cell walls and move from one
cell wall all the way through the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just by staying in the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called the apoplastic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that situation, uh, there are,
there are things that live in the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: walls that are, that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're bacteria and fungi,
and these are capable of, of, of through
[SPEAKER_00]: this reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure going back out in the soil and
they do also, they drop off their
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics, you know, they, they,
they take out bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now we've got a situation where not
only do we have these guys, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going into the simplistic
pathway and moving back out into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that I always thought
they could do by going through the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, you got a sort of a
second way the plants are feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what is there a different,
there's not enough information for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to tell exactly what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so excited about it, as you can
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause this information is going to be
coming available.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so everybody needs to keep an eye on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't quite know what the,
um, commercial or human application might
[SPEAKER_02]: be for this, this amazing process,
but, uh, it's something new kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: what mycorrhizal fungus was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gosh, now probably what 15,
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, and that's a very good
comparison because in a way these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: operating like a mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going into the plant root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's kind of an
interesting situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, uh, it's going to be
fascinating to figure out how they,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to watch how they study it and figure
it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going beyond, obviously the
tundra plant now we're into, into regular
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does cannabis do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it's one of these things
where an article sort of plopped out in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, and it just doesn't have
enough specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so maybe I got to, I just read it in
the paper about a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to, I got to, maybe I need to
contact the author and see what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, stay tuned on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it turns out to be, you know,
a significant way plants obtain their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, I'm going to have to revise the
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen commercial applications now
for, uh, or commercial products around
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytic bacteria where they've studied,
studied this essentially in this case,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was from the vents of a Yellowstone,
a specific bacteria that they're now
[SPEAKER_02]: culturing and using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found a supposedly great success
in mediating abiotic stress in plants by
[SPEAKER_02]: using this endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've set up some trials over at a
local, uh, cannabis facility that I work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we haven't gotten any definitive
results yet, but that was something I was
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that because when I, when I wrote
to me with microbes, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground, every plant has at least one
and really, really many more than that up
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 300, 350, uh, different endo endo
phatic, uh, organisms in the, in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're sort of comparable to
the, like the risal fungi below ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: but above ground, you've got all these
endophytic fungi and endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I predicted back then that,
gee, you know, we're, we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing these things in commercial
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, it's just terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, so, so what's the name of the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may ask you, or does it not have a
name yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't remember off the top of
my head, I'd have to go back into my email
[SPEAKER_02]: and dig it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's been a few months since we
started, uh, but they they're working in
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually a local company to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, we're going to hopefully
get some information off the trials and
[SPEAKER_02]: see if we can figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and that's, that's
what's so exciting about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular, this particular hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, you get to do things that you
just normally wouldn't think about doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a guy speak in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, very interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and, and it was right up our
alley, you and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, what he was talking about was
making specialized teas, really
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and his theory, and I think he's
proven it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a lot of stuff in your compost
pile and end up in your compost teas that
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't normally think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was concentrating on a number of
things, one of which was chitin,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which I found very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, he, he, he goes to the ocean or
the beach and he collects soil that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that can, you know, that was made by
kelp and seaweed and all those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: decaying, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I suppose you could make your own by
going to get kelp and seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and then, uh, what he's
discovered is that that the chitin that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the bodies of the organisms,
uh, that eat that kind of soil or live in
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of soil, uh, that chitin becomes
an unbelievable tool in protecting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you, as you know, uh, a lot of the
mycorrhizal fungi, uh, chitin prevents
[SPEAKER_00]: some nematodes from getting into the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't like chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, so, so what this guy does is
grow, he grows organisms that have chitin
[SPEAKER_00]: in their bodies, fungi, but they're also
bacteria and other things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, deal with chitin and break it
down and do all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he, and then he uses it in,
in, in, in specialized teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done the same thing by make,
by taking some of the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that you might use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I can never pronounce their
names skimped or slowly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mite, uh, and he, and he grows them in
massive quantities in this compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, so that their metabytes, you know,
the, the things that they produce are in
[SPEAKER_00]: that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then become useful in growing the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's just sort of just a
little bit more of an extension of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do by trying to make a designer fungal or
designer bacteria, uh, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and since I live near the coast,
I'll be trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see more research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I know the, like, for example,
the insect frost that we source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has a really high levels of chitinase
producing, uh, bacteria, which produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's called chitinase and that
enzyme is what is effective in dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with these insects in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're describing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are seeing a lot of like
these, uh, Korean natural farmers and
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming where they're taking
local, their local soils and using that in
[SPEAKER_02]: teas as a way of increasing indigenous
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's definitely catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see how it all plays out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, funny enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you the name of, uh,
he's got a little lab and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, I think, I think it'd be
worth your communicating with,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly since, uh, you know,
you're, you're, you've got a lot of inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: on your farm, uh, and, and you live close
enough to the, to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can really fool around with a
lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I happen to know that you make some
pretty damn good compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, this would be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we've, we've known this
for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you can, if you can give it to the
plant, the plant will figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chitinase is important stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enables the stuff to break down without
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, very cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of new stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but lots of old stuff going on as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people, people who listen to
your podcast probably get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a chuckle or, or, or maybe are just a
little bit confused by some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, uh, last week there was an
article about a, I think she was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, this, this was a research
assistant, obviously in the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: She obviously had an advisor and the
article, uh, you know, it was one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: articles that I just couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article said, Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just discovered that plants create
their own microbial communities around
[SPEAKER_00]: their root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, and I read it and I went,
what, where's this lady been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where has this lady been?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more important, where has her
advisor been all these years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, this is not a new discovery,
but it's written up like it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so, so people read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, it's, it's pretty
interesting how much, how, how further,
[SPEAKER_00]: further along the spectrum we are as
growers, you know, and as hobby growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, compared to so many other people who,
who deal with plants, it's just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis growers have to give
themselves a pat on the back, frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, best best gardeners I've ever met,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the idea that, uh, you know,
you're pushing the envelope with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cannabis growers and giant pumpkin
growers, people that are really trying out
[SPEAKER_02]: new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I also love that science does
catch up and then tell us where we were
[SPEAKER_02]: way off base.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of stuff that
cannabis industry has tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, a lot of things that giant
pumpkin growers, some pumpkin growers have
[SPEAKER_02]: done that is just not panned out over time
that we thought was good science when we
[SPEAKER_02]: first started doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, it is a balance,
but I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis growers are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I was just talking with someone
how, uh, a lot of, for a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, uh, it's becoming the new gateway
drug to vegetable gardening and where
[SPEAKER_02]: their food comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been a wonderful adjunct to all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and as, as you know, we don't want
to ruin it for the next show, but we'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do a future show on my upcoming
book, which is on auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I take the perspective,
uh, and this is not a book that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: written for you or for the listeners of
this particular podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a book I wrote for, you know,
my wife, uh, a sister, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, somebody that's not a professional
grower, that's just a gardener because I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that auto flowering cannabis have
reached a point now where they are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the next tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just to, without getting too far
into it, just to cap it off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've reached the point now
where they are so easy to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and so effective in terms of what
they're able to deliver in terms of CBD or
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, uh, you know, uh, that I think they
are the next hobby plant in our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a new plant comes along once or twice,
uh, in the vegetable world snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peas is the one that I remember more than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't any, and now all of a sudden
there's, you know, seven, eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 15 different kinds of snap peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody grows them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what auto flowering
cannabis I think is going to do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigma is dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once it drops, Hey, this is the next
tomato, the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll, I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do another show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, but, uh, uh, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we are a gateway into
growing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing food organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know I said I wanted to wait on
that, uh, cause you have your books coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out when in October, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a whole conversation about
that, but yeah, we, well we will,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I, do you want to, do you want to talk
briefly about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you want to talk a little bit
about what auto flowers are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know most of the people on this podcast
are probably pretty familiar, but have you
[SPEAKER_02]: learned anything really interesting about
their history or something that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, might surprise listeners that we
didn't know about auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the most surprising,
there are two surprising things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the most surprising thing is that auto
flowers are now as strong and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and can produce almost as well,
uh, as, as a standardized, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the regular kinds of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is I was dumbfounded how
many people do not know what auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they, and even professional
growers, and once they hear about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go, wow, the possibilities are
endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so for those who don't know,
uh, auto flowering cannabis does not
[SPEAKER_00]: require a photo period like Indica and
Sativa cannabis plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you can grow it any time of
the year where the temperature is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you can grow it indoors or
outdoors any time of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but better than that, they go from seed to
harvest in seven to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't have the breeding that
we have put into our Sativas and our
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've put Afghan hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they are the basis of all the plants
we grow, except for these auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and they, they take a long time
to mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These auto flowers, seven to nine weeks,
harvest, seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breeding that's going on with them
is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite easy to breed two existing auto
flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to breed an auto flower
plant with, uh, you know, a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, you can do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a bit longer and obviously it
takes many more generations, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: an exciting new adjunct to our hobby,
but to the gardening world, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a brand new hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody wants to just quickly hop
over to Amazon and pre-order the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the DIY auto flowering
cannabis, a new way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to say there's a new bud in
town and this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and if you're a grower currently
and are turning your nose up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, you know, these things go on the
internet, look up some of these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, get some of these new seeds and
just try them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you'll be flipping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one question I had, I had heard that,
I don't know if in your research you found
[SPEAKER_02]: the origin story of what, what cannabis
ruderalis essentially is, is auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I understand it, and that they were
discovered in Siberia on the side of a
[SPEAKER_02]: road or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what have you found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the story goes that there was a
scientist in the Volga river area and he
[SPEAKER_00]: stumbled upon this in his travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and it was about 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1900, 1903 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it didn't have any PhD in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, you know, sort of a scrubby
looking little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he didn't really think too much about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he did, he did realize it was a
photo, a photo period list plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but he didn't think too much about it
and didn't really do much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and people fooled around with them a
little bit in the seventies, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: just, they just weren't kicking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then people began to discover
them in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so so in addition to, uh, the Volga
river area, which is not Siberia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they found it in Siberia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people have found them in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard stories that people have found
them along the railroad tracks in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_00]: although I've been unable to track that
one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, but there are scrubby little
plant, uh, they're about a foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: foot and a half tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes a little bigger if you give
them a little bit of food, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're just a funny looking little
cannabis plant that, uh, that grows so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and doesn't have a photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it doesn't have a photo
period is because it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great example of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: These escaped from plantations where
people were growing hemp for probably rope
[SPEAKER_00]: and sail cloth and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they realize, Oh, I better flower
right now or I'm not going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowering cannabis, the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to do a quick plug for a forum
called autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to go and read a little bit
about it, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Jeff's posted on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've posted on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't check it as frequently as I
probably could, but, um, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: great guys on there that are more familiar
with auto flowers than anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, and if you want to, you know,
soup to nuts, if you want to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: where to buy seeds, they cover all the
seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little, you know, little splays
off of various different forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tell a story, you know,
a tab that, uh, you know, when I came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea to write the book,
um, and again, it's not a book for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a book for, you know, parents who
want to be, you know, or gardeners who
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to get into a new kind of
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, boy, I really have a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have consumed the Kool-Aid that the
stigma is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't I, you know, Oh yeah, your father
and mother will be growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yours might be, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it's just one of these,
it's just a phenomenal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are just going to fall in
love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you like about growing a
regular plant, you can do with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors, shapes, sizes, uh, breeding,
not breeding, feminizing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: male, female, the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fabulous and all in seven to
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine, uh, what the difference
is in a breeding program?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's seven to nine weeks versus seven
to nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't had a chance to grow auto
flowers yet, but I think this year I might
[SPEAKER_02]: get the opportunity to get to experiment
with them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited for that and I'm excited to
read your book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll definitely come back on and have
a podcast just on auto flowers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, maybe closer to October.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be
interesting to see what happens to the
[SPEAKER_00]: book because again, you know, I write
these books for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't write them for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, this one I did write for somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it, you know, for people who don't
grow, but yeah, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed on these books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just learned that, uh, teaming with
microbes and teaming with fungi are both
[SPEAKER_00]: being translated into German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I talked to a woman the other day
about, uh, teaming with microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and you know, I got to thank people
like you and your listeners, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who, who, who've just adopted the book is
as sort of a good, a good read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, write these books for myself,
but only one person buying a book,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it doesn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, so I thank everybody for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may have been more than kind and
buying the book and telling friends about
[SPEAKER_00]: it or all the books and telling friends
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't tell you, I was in,
uh, the San Juan's this past week on
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend for a friend's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walked into the bookstore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I went straight to the
gardening section and teaming with fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: was right there in the front best
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the bookshelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also Jesse Bloom's book and
Steve Solomon's book.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that I've interviewed on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow, I know a lot of the
really cool people in the gardening world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that fun?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Steve, Steve of course was in
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, uh, you know, I used to be on
this list serve for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have any time anymore
because, because he was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he, uh, initially he thought his system of
growing, which is, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of a better word, minerals,
uh, versus microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't, you know, he, he was not a big
fan of the microbe system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and I think he's come along quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, you know, I think some of the
things Dr. Lane said he didn't agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I think he, I think he sort of
went the other way and I think he's back
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, uh, you know, the, the two
systems work quite well, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, it's the microbes that put
the charge on the minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you gotta have them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're both a little right and a
little wrong too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try and use a combination of both by
remineralizing the soil and then having
[SPEAKER_02]: good biological activity and diversity and
promoting the sorts of things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about in teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Hey, Hey, Hey, that reminds me of
something I want to, I want to go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think, I think this was the show
where I created the, uh, the controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, we talked about whether
cannabis should be grown in fungally
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated soil or bacterially dominated
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I think I, I, what I said was,
you know, it's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a perennial plant and it likes
bacterially dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, again, I don't want to put
any words in her mouth, but I believe Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lane said, no, you know, her research
indicates that it really likes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit like fungally dominated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically the, that what she said
or, uh, I don't, again, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put words in her mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, I think the right answer is,
you know, as I went back and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: looked and looked and thought about it in
light of the auto flowering book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to, I want to sort of change my
answer a little bit if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still believe that it likes bacterial
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think you've got to take a look
at which variety you're growing first of
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing an auto flower plant,
jeez, these are in the ground for only
[SPEAKER_00]: nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In weeks, those, those love bacterially
dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are clearly in my mind, bacterially
dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the testing I've done, you know,
they thrive with the bacterial soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you make it, if you make,
if you make the soil too rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't do very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's, that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is when, when we talk
about bacterial soil, we're not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about soil that is, or I'm not talking
about soil that's void of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterially dominated simply means that
you have more bacteria than fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and obviously you need to have
fungi to break down stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you, you know, you've got to have,
you've got to have the fungi in your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's, uh, you know, it's supposed
to be heavily bacterially dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to have some fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in the soil and make it soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're growing a, let's go back
to my original thought, I thought that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing an Afghani, uh,
you know, that's a nine month long plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, it necessarily in nature is
going to have soils that where,
[SPEAKER_00]: where fungi have, have come in,
uh, you know, and, and, and establish
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to want to have more
fungi for the plants that take longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know now pretty well how long a
seed's going to take, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream takes X amount and,
you know, uh, uh, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, blueberry takes Y amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so I think we've got to be
thinking of in terms of that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I just wanted to clarify that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think they, they like bacterially
dominated soil, uh, but you've got to have
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and if I'm, if I'm correct in putting
words in her mouth, I believe that Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine, uh, thinks that you need to have a
little bit more fungal than bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I'll sort of leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to argue with Dr. Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, she is, she's been so important to
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I, I hate to argue with her until
I have empirical evidence and we sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a few thoughts on the subject
that I'd love to get your opinion on too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, when we talk about fungally
dominant or bacterial dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we're really talking about the plant
succession table, which I think are chart,
[SPEAKER_02]: which people get, I think overly caught up
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, if we were trying to grow cannabis
or lettuce or some, you know, annual crop
[SPEAKER_02]: at the very edge of an old oak forest,
we may have issues with that because that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil has been established.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when we till the soil,
we're getting that reset that you talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about and getting some more bacteria in
there.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, uh, all soils are probably,
you know, like you said, all soils need
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the subway system for our bacteria
to move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It prevents erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the things that you talk about in,
in teaming with Michael, microbes and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I make a compost tea, cause this
is where I find that people email me and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, I'm growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a bacterial tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, I don't want fungus,
so I'm doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I want a fungally dominant tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to add, you know, baby oats and
then, and then get this fungally dominated
[SPEAKER_02]: tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people get so caught up in
that, that they forget that compost tea is
[SPEAKER_02]: really about microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause realistically that, that cannabis
plant or that tomato or lettuce is really
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: What organisms are going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trying to put out as many as
we can and really let the plant be in
[SPEAKER_02]: charge of that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always, you know, in my talks,
I always start out with the concept that,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, this is how the system works,
but the plant is in control, not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the plant that makes the decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if you, even if you put down a
bacteria dominated tea, if the plant needs
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal, fungal, you know, materials or
needs to attract more, it'll change the
[SPEAKER_00]: eschidine and do what it needs to do to
get the fungal that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to get, we tend to get hung up on
the theoretical, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in order to explain the system,
we talk about, you know, fungal bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the succession chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do now in my talk is I,
is I, as I say, basically, if it's in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's in the ground for more than a
year, it really needs much more fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: than, than bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's in the ground for less than a
year, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of how I leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant, you're right, is in control
and is going to make the decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can live long enough, and generally
it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're in a situation where
you've taken a plant up to space and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing it in a baby diaper,
you know, and you've given it fungal and
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs bacteria, it's not going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's in regular soil, it'll,
it'll figure out if it can live long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough how to get the goodies that it
needs from those, those bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't give them enough credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I agree with you 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also say that when we talk about
bacteria and fungi, there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different species, you know, tens of
thousands of species of bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know which one is the mechanism,
mechanism of action in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't just say, I would argue,
we can't just say bacteria, adding
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria is going to be beneficial without
knowing what species of bacteria or strain
[SPEAKER_02]: of bacteria we're adding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, with compost tea, it's the
shotgun approach, but I don't want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: too caught up because it's very easy to
add bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's easy to make more bacteria,
but we want to make sure they're
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial bacteria and that they're
working in, you know, a functioning
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient cycling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, then I always, I always
add, but if nothing else and you put a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial down and you really wanted to
fungal, the bacteria might die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, something else in the
soil, food web will use it to make
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the plant ultimately is going to
say it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a beautiful system, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that reminds me of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I see you being quoted now as like a
authority on these subjects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will say in forums, you know,
I read in teaming with microbes this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll read, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else will say, well, in teaming
with fungi, Jeff says this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this particular case, the topic was
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it, does pH matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in this case, the gentleman had
water that was, I think like eight three
[SPEAKER_02]: or eight four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were saying, you don't need to
worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants, the microbes in the soil are
going to buffer the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have my own thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally believe that pH is still a
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've gotten away with a lot
because the microbes do offer some
[SPEAKER_02]: buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, 75, 80% of the time,
and I'm making those numbers up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, we can check our pH pen and not
have issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I saw water that was, you know,
seven six, seven five or higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want to be adding an acid and you
know, like citric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: To lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead, tell me your thoughts on pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I think what people are
forgetting is what I say is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the only place where pH counts is
around the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's, that's really probably too
much of a generalized statement because
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH doesn't just affect the bacteria
and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, other organisms are impacted by
pH as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, but we tend to think of it just
in terms of how, how it impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of a plant to be able to take up
certain nutrients, which is bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi related, I think ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, so the area where pH counts is
where the plant doesn't count on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are no roots on the surface,
who cares what the pH is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that I think, you know,
that's, so I get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if someone gave me a glass of acid and
said, here, what are your plants with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the plants are going to take care
of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're
misunderstanding what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course you got to be cognizant of
what's, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, as you say, 70,
80% of the time, you don't got to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to take care of it for
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you've got an extreme
situation, yeah, you've got to pay some
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I, do I test for pH all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I see something going on with my
plant, that's one of the first things I
[SPEAKER_00]: think about is pH and it's one of the
easiest things to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's sort of where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant and the natural system should
take care of your pH for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, but in your, in the example you
gave, you know, you got somebody adding a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an outside substance with a pH
of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, you know, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a natural system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when we talk about commercial
cultivation, you know, where you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this for a living, I, I like to see a good
soil test initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we usually use the Malik
three and the saturated paste just to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the ballpark figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take these numbers as,
you know, as scripture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be able to track trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to have a number,
any number is helpful, but if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some specific ones and that's as long as
you use the same ones each time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think testing your water too is
really important, especially for people on
[SPEAKER_02]: the wells, as that water may fluctuate
throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen it with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but, but here again, if you were
dealing with a normal crop, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would let it adjust itself,
but we're dealing with a commercial crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and we, you know, you're, you're,
you're selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay attention to it in all
aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, you want to know everything,
you want to know the pH, you want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK, you want to know micro biomass,
uh, all of these things are, have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: fooling around with the bio micro biometer
at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, uh, I haven't quite gotten on
board with that product yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've loved, I think we already had
this discussion, but we can have it on air
[SPEAKER_02]: for listeners too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I approach this, the microbe side
a little differently than you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for me, for example, this,
this micro biometer that would tell me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, microbial biomass in the soil,
it doesn't identify species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for me, it doesn't change my.
[SPEAKER_02]: My behaviors in terms of how I garden and
that that's why I haven't quite figured
[SPEAKER_02]: out a use for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my head, because I'm already going to
be, you know, making compost teas or using
[SPEAKER_02]: a high quality compost or doing things to
increase microbial biomass and diversity,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting a test back that says
it's lower high doesn't change my
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening habit particularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I use it for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, first I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me, let me back up a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro biomass in general, you can,
you can use micro biomass changes in micro
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass to tell you whether inputs are
helping or hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the first place where I use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come to me all the time and say,
Hey, when you endorse this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: any good, you know, I mean, I got to grow
plants and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that it's able to increase a
biomass in the soil in a positive way is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good indicator that it's a pretty good
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use it for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I think you could do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you make a new kind of tea,
you want to see whether it's, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, is it adding to the biomass or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take a test before and then
you take one after it's just like you do
[SPEAKER_00]: an NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also use it to, to determine
what the plant is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, so plants in the springtime,
uh, produce tremendous amounts of exudate
[SPEAKER_00]: and increase their biomass around their
root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can track it, uh, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can track the cannabis plant biomass
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they change biomass when they start to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so it's a, it's just, it's another
tool now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does not identify species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and right now, uh,
it doesn't distinguish between bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, although there is now a beta test
going on on the next version, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, uh, which will, I think will be
very useful and maybe increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: potential use of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do a little bit of bacterial
fungi, uh, identify, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio or quantity identification,
that would be very, very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to be able to do pH as
well, which I think is going to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just another one of these
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's an exclusive tool,
but it's just another one of these tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you quantify whether what you're
doing is actually helping or there's
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and I find that to be a
fascinating thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all gardeners need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, but, but if you want analytics,
information is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another little piece of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, microbiometer.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are coming up with new uses for
it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, which is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever meet James Cetillo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anyway, he was the guy that gave the
talk that the woman who invented the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: heard and decided to go home and,
and put the thing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And James was a wonderful compost tea
brewer, uh, really avant-garde designer
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, maintained a high line in New
York, the world trade center, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the battery parks, you know, a lot of,
a lot of the, uh, stuff along,
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Harbor in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately he died last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really added a lot to the compost
tea world, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so upset about that, but, uh,
he, he had some involvement with the micro
[SPEAKER_00]: biometer, which is why I thought about it,
but don't want to be a downer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on the back nine and it's how we
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that appraised that game well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be organic folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I do recognize his name that you say it
from compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I don't think I ever met him,
but I'm sure my father knew him,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to talk a little more about this
microbiometer, if I were to apply,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, micro isofungi or apply E coli or
salmonella, it would show an increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, it would, but it would smell
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, but my garage, she's,
she's got some stuff, very exciting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: about micro isofungi coming into the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's in beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, but yeah, I mean, and I had this
conversation with sort of obliquely with
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine, you know, it's not, you know,
yeah, if you put E coli in your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to smell bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in other words, you gotta,
you gotta, you gotta know something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web in order to be able to
use that tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you pick up soil, it smells bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what the micro biomass is,
it's bad soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's something wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you pick up that soil and it
smells sweet and measure the micro
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so, so, so it doesn't,
it doesn't, so just to be clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't replace NPK or soil food web
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got to do those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or, or, or look in a microscope
instead of the cell food web test,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but it, but it is a very interesting
effect of a new tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another question I had then was,
so I went to this soil scientist
[SPEAKER_02]: conference last January, uh, in San Diego
and it was very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what some of the speakers were talking
about, you know, they were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: identifying the specific bacterias and
their levels in soils, but they were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how biomass changes,
uh, throughout the day, even at like an
[SPEAKER_02]: hourly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, are we just looking for a range
with a product like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or because it will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that dramatic a change,
frankly, but, uh, it does change,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not that dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're talking about is, you know,
if you look at a soil and it on the scale
[SPEAKER_00]: of one to 2000, and it has a reading of
285 on the micro biometer test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you take out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neat thing about it is you can do it
right there in the field right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, and, and then, you know,
you know that you need to add something to
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not high enough biomass to be able
to feed those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have one that's 1700,
oh my God, you know, you've got a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start concentrating on other
things than your, than your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that, you know, it's a useful tool
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it incredibly useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I'm having, I'm having,
I'm having fun just sort of wandering
[SPEAKER_00]: around and, you know, I go into the forest
and I, holy crow, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, some of the things I measure,
it's just, but anyway, I'm a nutball,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm I mean, I would walk around
with a microscope if I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a lot of time, you know,
fooling around testing with these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's efficient and practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, one of the other companies that I
looked into was Solvita.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made, they do soil respiration tests
and there's actually a lot of really good
[SPEAKER_02]: research around measuring soil respiration
and CO2, uh, coming off of soils to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what sort of aerobic activity you have in
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're just, the issue I had was they
were just really expensive still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the great company, but expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there, there's some limitations to
the, to the test as well, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, I can't, all of these tests,
whether, you know, whether they're perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, they all help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all give you information and
information is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you want to know that,
you know, I think, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized test for micro, you know,
microbiome mass is to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, they come from their cells
and it just takes two months, $500 is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, so I'm glad we're seeing
these new tests coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think ultimately, let's go back
to the question of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we're going to have machines
in our own homes that are going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or our phone, our cell phone, uh,
you know, that's going to enable us to
[SPEAKER_00]: take pictures and be able to go to be able
to determine what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and boy, would that be an exciting
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so for example, I always talk about
this, this article I read last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in science, I think it was in science
news, where they go around, they test
[SPEAKER_00]: soils all around the world and there are
511 bacterial taxes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial families that pop up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test soils, you know, well,
what if you go to the kiss farm and you
[SPEAKER_00]: test the soil and it's only got,
it's only got 428, it's missing those
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones, you know, which one is missing
and if you put them in, does it make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it make the soil better?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, you got to be able to
identify these bacteria and so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting closer and closer and
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all ultimately, I believe going to
be growing a little flower cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have a, uh,
you know, one of these 3d printers in our
[SPEAKER_00]: houses, you know, so that when you want a
new piece for the kiss machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just go to kisses website,
you know, and you, and you download the
[SPEAKER_00]: template to make the new pipe and poof,
you make it, you know, uh, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot what the third thing was,
which was the point I was trying to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, uh, you know, we're all going to
have bacterial and bacterial and fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: identification abilities and we're going
to be able to say, Oh, Oh, this soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing 16 different kinds of bacteria
that it needs or this soil has got powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So science is so fascinating to me,
but I was, uh, you know, getting back to
[SPEAKER_02]: what you talked about with cannabis
growing and all of that being sort of on
[SPEAKER_02]: the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff that they were sharing
at the conference, uh, very specific,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it did seem like things that was kind
of like, Oh yeah, duh.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already, we already kind of knew that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're able to prove it with,
you know, trials and these, these,
[SPEAKER_02]: the methodology that they're setting up
with these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's face it, uh, as we get more
legalization and opportunities to study,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who the things we're going to be
able to pick out, you know, when you study
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant in like cannabis where there is a
demand and they need different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: uses and all the different, different
chemical ingredients that we're all trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some unbelievable
research opportunities, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, once in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's, it's going to happen because
sooner or later, our stupid federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government is going to back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're just, you know, we're just
going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it, once that happens and you can
do research on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, changing subjects here,
anything you want to share, looking back
[SPEAKER_02]: at your three books that are already on
them on the market, um, mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I know, remember when you first
came out with team in microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had the pH switched in there and you
had to send out a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a silly error, but was there
anything you found that you've been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, looking back, this was really
important and I wish I'd talked more about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did that with mycorrhizal
fungus or I've changed my mind on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, uh, I didn't include
algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, algae is part of the soil,
uh, and they're part of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a, that was a whole
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, gosh, you know, I have every now and
then jotted down little things and I just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm drawing a blank right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I guess what I ought to say is if
any listeners come across stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: bothers them, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and we'll take a look at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that pH problem plagues me because
every time they do a reprint, a
[SPEAKER_00]: reprinting, they go back to the first one
and it has the mistake in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, uh, and, and then I will always
worry about is the Dutch, does the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: version have the mistake in pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the Korean version, uh, you know,
it's in 11 languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that sort of bothers me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, to talk about the books
in general, I think what I, what I have
[SPEAKER_00]: found to be the most satisfying in,
in addition to the fact that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted the books and have read them and,
you know, sort of applied and improved on
[SPEAKER_00]: them and all that kind of stuff is the
fact that people are now reading the books
[SPEAKER_00]: as a trilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was a little concerned that
people were going to think these were
[SPEAKER_00]: three very separate books, but they're
not, they really are tied together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously the teaming with fungi
is an adjunct with teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi are a microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at the time I wrote the team with
microbes, there wasn't really this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, wealth of information or, or,
uh, I don't want to say craze,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a need for the mycorrhizal fungi
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just appeared in, you know,
2011, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why that one came.
[SPEAKER_00]: But teaming with nutrients appears because
why write team with microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Team with microbes is just how the food
gets to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important to know how it gets
in the plant and how it operates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could, you can think about it
in terms of, where it was in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's all packaged and all fits
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, uh, I, I really encourage
people when they pick up a gardening book,
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of gardening book to always try
to, to fit it into the, to their body of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, because these things are not
written in isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people do just pick up a
gardening, what's wrong with my plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and they read it and they don't
think about it in terms of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only think about it in terms of what
the leaves are telling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you gotta be thinking more
holistically, uh, in order, in order to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really successful at what, at what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of a, that's sort of a
biodynamic concept, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's none of the whole,
it's the whole, you gotta put everything
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't look at just one part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny because, uh,
soil really gets a, uh, the bad rap or
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about a plant that's not
looking as well, uh, people forget about
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other variables like lighting and
humidity, temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in my case, I find, I'd say,
and again, I'm making up these numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, 75% of the people that have issues,
it's their watering habits even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that affects the microbial community
so dramatically with these living soils
[SPEAKER_02]: that they end up, uh, what looks like a
deficiency is actually over or under
[SPEAKER_02]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny cause you raise these
things up in my, in my basic talk that I
[SPEAKER_00]: give, you know, about the fifth or sixth
laugh slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you give a talk,
if you, if you put in slides that generate
[SPEAKER_00]: in theory, if people are understanding
what you're saying, a laugh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're listening and that they
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't laugh and they get to
that slide, then you didn't explain it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you gotta go make sure you do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my last slides at the very
beginning is a picture, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a guy standing in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have one of a, of a reader board
that says, uh, uh, spring is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wet my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I always say to people,
we water our plants, not necessarily to
[SPEAKER_00]: give the plant water, although that's
obviously important, but to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and the microbes alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need water for God sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's amazing, but in the
gardening world, not the cannabis world in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gardening world, every garden writer
in America has written at least one column
[SPEAKER_00]: or done one radio or television show where
on the subject of the number one mistake
[SPEAKER_00]: people make is they overwater their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number two mistake they make is they
underwater their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't write that column once
during the year, you know, then,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you haven't, you haven't,
you know, complied with the rules of
[SPEAKER_00]: garden writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, watering is so key, so key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just, you'd think it's intuitive,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played around with moisture
meters at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we use one from blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a digital moisture meter,
but I'm always looking for other,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other suggestions and what other
people are doing to measure, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: more quantitatively their, their levels in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I used to, uh, you know, and then I
found there wasn't the one I had wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and I've never, I've never gone
back and done it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I suppose I could, um, I like to use
my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very accurate, of course, but,
uh, something I've always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about a myth, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your finger can't tell when the soil is
moist properly or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've heard that too,
but then one of the best, uh, gardeners
[SPEAKER_02]: that my botany teacher, he, that's what he
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He uses his finger and I was like,
well, that's not that scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: but man, you know, you're the best
gardener or grower I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to argue with you on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father taught me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same finger you pick your nose
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, but it is, uh, but meters of
fun again, because the quantum of
[SPEAKER_00]: information, once you start collecting
this information, you know, if you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, oh my gosh, you get a whole
different picture, a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, what is withholding water do
this flowering, you know, what is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what is withholding water do
the, uh, to the production of trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating, fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and fortunately in the cannabis world,
we tend to share that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were talking a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we want to necessarily get
into it, but, but the silos, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, you know, cause people,
people in the cannabis world were sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: information, you know, and now we've got a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we do, we tend to share
information and I hope we continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, very important,
uh, particularly with the big guys trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into the business, you know,
we got to, we got to support ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not competition that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, that's healthy
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's the big guys we've got to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do have actually one other
question I wanted to, I wanted to bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: and see if you had any information on,
um, so I got a call a few weeks ago about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a woman who was vegetable gardening
and she'd done a test on her native soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also her raised bed garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came back with 40 PPM of lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: In her raised bed garden, you know,
where she bought potting soil versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: one where her native soil was zero PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was, you know, obviously upset
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea what 40 PPM of lead
meant on this particular test to know if
[SPEAKER_02]: that was an issue or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called the WSDA and Washington state
department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Hey, what kind of regulations
do you have around heavy metal testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for me, as a soil company who
because of the level of fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients we're putting into our soils,
I had to register our soil as a
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer, which requires heavy metal
testing to make sure it's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I had registered as a potting soil
or a soil amendment, uh, what I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: from the WSDA is there really isn't any
requirement there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could have high levels of cadmium or
lead or arsenic and, uh, they wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wouldn't know or really not,
I won't say they won't care, but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no legislative, uh, policy around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh, it's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worse than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to have radioactivity in
your material, it's not tested for that
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so you, you, you know,
it's unbelievable what you can get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with putting in potting soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called the Oregon department of
agriculture because they've always been
[SPEAKER_02]: really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, whenever I've talked to them and
basically what they said is, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had to pass me through to a few
people and came back with, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't, if you're buying it off,
you know, by the truck load, or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: just getting loaded in the back of a
pickup, uh, we don't, we don't test it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you're putting it into a bag,
then we do require heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause all of these states have different
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, what they said was,
and it was, I want to say it was a very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 238 PPM or 243.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, how is this, how did you
come up with this number?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was somewhere right around that
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, the, uh,
FDA, hired this consulting company way
[SPEAKER_02]: back, you know, 20, 30 years ago to set
these levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've used them ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I asked for him to send me
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that research yet,
but, uh, you know, that made 40 PPM not
[SPEAKER_02]: look so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if, but then I got thinking about it,
you know, if we're growing root crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we're growing cannabis, you know,
things that are, there's a lot of research
[SPEAKER_02]: to show that they're dynamic accumulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: They uptake heavy metals really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how do we know that what we're getting
is safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I just wanted to
bring up for listeners because the people
[SPEAKER_02]: are sourcing things from so many different
places that are using really, really high
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could be getting these heavy metals
in their final crop and, uh, it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to hear your opinion and
what, what you found on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm very concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first of all, let's talk about the 40
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this stuff is cumulative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so, so yeah, it may only be 40,
you know, but, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you go, then you go, and,
uh, you know, rub up against your wall or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, so it adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a backpack, you know,
it's 40, but then you run into something
[SPEAKER_00]: else that's 40 and all of a sudden you
have 80 in your backpack, not just 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that I, I, I'm concerned about any
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think it had anything to do
with the fact that one was raised bed and
[SPEAKER_00]: one was in ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was the soil that they brought
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it had, it had the lead in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am very concerned about the fact
that, that, that we do not test for lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff in the cannabis industry in
Alaska, where I live, they don't test for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that kicks me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, where's our,
where's our clean green certified
[SPEAKER_00]: organicky, you know, standard,
uh, but this is something we're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, uh, you know, it's not just lead,
it's radioactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it's arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and yeah, I mean, we should be
testing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing a plant like a fern
or a cannabis that can create this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of them, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're not eating or smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's upsetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go back and look at the
research, but I'm not sure if it
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulates it into its trichomes or if it
just goes into its leaf biomass,
[SPEAKER_02]: in which case it's a little less
concerning for cannabis, but there always
[SPEAKER_02]: is some leaf material, you know,
when you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting, you know, in, in,
in the modern world, they're putting those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves into a machine that's turning them
into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the lead still there in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so whether it's trichome or leaf,
if it's in the plant and you're turning it
[SPEAKER_00]: into an oil, uh, you know, that's a
potential problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the research a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a terrific podcast, uh,
that ran recently, uh, uh, and I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember whether it was radio lab or
something of that sort, but people can
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it, uh, involving, uh, lead
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lead paint, the little Dutch boy
that's on the lead paint, uh, and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, oh, so it's a brand new
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember it's a brand new podcast where
they're trying to say to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Passies?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do something about this with
various subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have a whole podcast about the
lead paint industry, the little Dutch boy
[SPEAKER_00]: and how there's so much lead in lead paint
and why it was there and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and why it's still around 30 years
later, we haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That damn thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not holding national lead
company that made the paint and other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good God, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, fascinating Google it and
listeners will be fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, that's really interesting,
especially since I'm getting ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: paint my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not just, not just the lead
radioactivity is something that always
[SPEAKER_00]: gets me in the, in, you have to,
in order to put, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your radioactivity into a landfill,
your nuclear waste, you got to fill out
[SPEAKER_00]: form after form after form in order to put
it into your potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing bad, bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we done to ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moral is, uh, you know,
definitely test and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you, you get information,
you get smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a downer to end the podcast on,
but know where you source your
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all, in all regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and just so that we can,
you know, keep it into the organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not just these chemicals that you've
got to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using manure, for example,
and it's got tremendous amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus in it, you know, it could be
that you're using so much manure that you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that your phosphorus levels in your soil,
even though the stuff gets lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locked up are so high that mycorrhizal
fungi will never work in your soil for a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you got to test folks to know what
your numbers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you can figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with a, with the soil that has
a, you know, a phosphorus number that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, uh, 250 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it should be 50 parts per
million or lower, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so yeah, testing is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just for the chemicals that we
know are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's for the good stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some recent testing around
nitrogen where, you know, it's being
[SPEAKER_02]: over-applied and we're seeing,
you know, some nitrogen toxicities
[SPEAKER_02]: actually from, from too high of levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where a test came in really
handy to sort of confirm what we thought
[SPEAKER_02]: we were seeing visually, uh, with the
price.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and again, in a place like,
like Alaska for years and years and years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a garden columnist, not me,
uh, who was telling people to put down
[SPEAKER_00]: eight 32 16, eight 32 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times a year on your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of, that's a lot of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those lawns, they've got phosphorus
for the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, yeah, we're not even allowed to
apply phosphorus on lawns here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pass laws around that because of,
uh, issues with it leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, I think nationally,
if people take a look at the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lawn food, lawn, uh, non-organic,
uh, lawn foods, you'll see there is a no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no number zero for the middle number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to put phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're 30, 40 years away from peak
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and, and, uh, that's going to be
a bad problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought climate change is a bit,
uh, if we run out of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, Jeff, I really appreciate
you taking the time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, look forward to seeing you soon here
at the cultivation classic, though this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast will probably come up after it's
already been, it's after it's already
[SPEAKER_02]: happened, but, uh, I'm looking forward to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to your talk and I
always keep an eye out for when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to my area, because it's always
great to hear you speak in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you can hardly shut me up
as you know, uh, so if anybody needs a
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker and they can afford it,
contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this new book, I think, uh,
your sister is going to love.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Jeff Lowenfels and you are
listening to the cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to leave us a good rating or
review on whatever platform you listen on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And check out the podcast page and kiss
organics YouTube channel for more
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not too early to pre-order Jeff's
new book on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can be one of the first to read it
and stay tuned because I have some great
[SPEAKER_02]: future episodes coming up where I'll be
sharing some research from some trials at
[SPEAKER_02]: a commercial cannabis facility and an
exciting new collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
