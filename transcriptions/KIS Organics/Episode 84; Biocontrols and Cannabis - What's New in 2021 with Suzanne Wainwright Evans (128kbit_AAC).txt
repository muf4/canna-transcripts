[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest this week is my good friend,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, also known by
[SPEAKER_02]: many as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_02]: primary focus on biological control and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting to
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses, nurseries, landscapers,
and interior scape companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the owner of Bug Lady Consulting,
now in business for over 21 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Suzanne, welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm super excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love chatting with you and I love all
your peeps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I'm excited too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have some wonderful topics
to go over for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with talking about some new
products and innovations that have
[SPEAKER_02]: happened in biocontrols since the last
time you were on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some really new exciting
things happening and it's not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: often that we get new products in
biocontrol because the biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and right now we're going to
talk more about macro biocontrols,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are your mites, insects,
and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are heavily regulated by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot just rear bugs and ship them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we typically don't get actually new
species of beneficials, which we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any new beneficials at this time,
but what we have is new technologies for
[SPEAKER_00]: the current beneficials that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this new product for applying
nematodes, which I'm super excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still really, really, really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a product out of Germany and
the manufacturer is a company called
[SPEAKER_00]: eNemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say that too fast because you'll say
the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eNemma has been making nematodes in
Germany for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to find a new
application method for nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, when we apply nematodes,
we generally drench them or sprinch them
[SPEAKER_00]: across the soil surface and then they
settle into that top portion of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really good right now for
especially fungus net larvae, western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips, onion thrips pupae,
which are down on the soil, which is fine
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are right on the top of the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're trying to do with
eNemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead and show you how
we manage pests that are lower in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they have come up with is
basically a slow release nematode system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, when you look at the
product, it looks like small tapioca
[SPEAKER_00]: pearls that you've soaked in water
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these little balls and they're kind
of spongy when you touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in each one of these small balls,
there's about 1600 nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you take this product and
then you pre-incorporate it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: media so that then you'll have nematodes
completely homogenously mixed through your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and it can stand up to the soil
mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over a series of several weeks,
you have nematodes slowly releasing out
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way through your media so that
again, you have better distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes as well as higher numbers in the
soil because of the ability to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: release and to come out of these little
pearls that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pearls are very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not any crazy chemicals that you're
going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically made of water,
sunflower, oil, there's some calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride, emulsifier, and there's sodium
alginate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all things that are not going
to be toxic to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really interesting novel way to
apply nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's brand new to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distributor for them is going to be
Bio-B, which many people already know
[SPEAKER_00]: because Bio-B is a large insectary in
Israel but they also sell here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, they're going to be
distributing this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now on the
website here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do look like little tapioca pearls.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be nice for reasons of if you
had a pot with drain holes on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume you're more likely to get any
fungus, gnat, larvae that are infecting
[SPEAKER_02]: those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of what you're thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I'm looking at,
I think it will be interesting to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and please do not run out people and say
nematodes control root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a petri dish, we know nematodes can get
inside of a root aphid, but they've never
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in a growing situation where you
just apply nematodes and the nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: infect the root aphids and control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because your root aphids are too
deep into the pot because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: most nematode drenches are right on the
soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be interesting to look at
if incorporating nematodes can help with
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's going to work,
but these are things we have to trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, and test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe even a combo program of an
intimal pathogen pre-incorporated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes to see if we can go after them
for multiple approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to do a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I'm interested in
about this is for the small home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because most nematodes come in larger
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you open the package,
you really have to use all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to store nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these would come in a cup and could be
stored in the refrigerator for a several
[SPEAKER_00]: week period, which from my understanding
from them, they can be, you could open
[SPEAKER_00]: your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you only have three or four
plants and you wanted to apply nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the soil surface, or even dibble holes
in your soil surface, drop some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and cover them, you could do
multiple of applications of nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the crop cycle where traditionally
when you buy the nematodes, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy them and apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can get very expensive to buy these
large packagings of nematodes and use them
[SPEAKER_00]: all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way you could do small applications
of them because there is research done
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that low dose regular applications
of nematodes work better on fungus nests
[SPEAKER_00]: and combination in really heavy and then
going without an application and going in
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low, low doses are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you back up a moment and talk about
what specific nematodes one would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you're talking about SF
nematodes here, but if you could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: explain that, and I'm not even trying to
pronounce them, I'll let you handle the
[SPEAKER_02]: pronunciations, but I don't want people to
think that like they can just go online
[SPEAKER_02]: and Google nematodes and think that
they're going to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's specific to a given pest,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there is some crossover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main three nematodes that we work
with currently in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: are Sinema Feltiae, and that's,
I mean, that's the majority of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because in research, it is shown
that performs best for fungus net
[SPEAKER_00]: management and for Western Flower Thrips
pupae in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Bacteria Fora, which is also
used, but a much smaller percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Carpocapsa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria Fora is typically used more for
beetle grubs, but Bacteria Fora still can
[SPEAKER_00]: infect like fly larva, but it's not the
best at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carpocapsa is used a bit more for
things like cutworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can work on flea larva in the soil
outside, but that doesn't mean that other
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, there's lots of crossover,
but the research basically picks the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that works the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not like Bacteria Fora and
Carpocapsa won't do anything for fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: net management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Feltiae has been the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there really hasn't been a lot of
looking at the different species and
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes for potential for root aphids
because, again, of the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: root aphids go really deep down on the
pot, and the nematodes just aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching down to where the nematodes are
when they're just top dressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this new form of application could
potentially, if research plays out,
[SPEAKER_02]: show better root aphid suppression
possibly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I still think you're gonna need
to do it in conjunction with, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: a microbial product of Averia,
Isaria, something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we don't have a magic bullet at
this point for root aphids, we need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: all the tools possible, and this may have
potential for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the product is, they just basically
launched this product at the Cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: Show two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be a while before we have
some US trials done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the research entomologist,
Dr. Steven Authors, who's a good friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine, who works at BioB, is doing trials
with this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should be hearing some stuff later
this year, potentially, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's something worth looking at and
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pricing, I am sure this is gonna be more
expensive than just regular conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, but if it's a situation where
you can incorporate this and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to apply again for X amount of
weeks where you're normally applying
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes weekly, it could be a labor
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that only comes in if you're a larger
grower or in a larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're a home-grow four or five
plants, it's not gonna be that much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cost savings because your labor is not
that intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I look forward to learning more
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and most of the products,
I believe right now, it's signed into a
[SPEAKER_00]: Feltier, but they do have the potential to
do a Bacteria 4 or Carpocapsate in this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I look forward to seeing where that
goes here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: as it becomes more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what else is going on in the
biocontrol world?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you have spent time with me
over the last bajillion years,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite predatory mite of all time is
Persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a tattoo person, I would have a
Persimilis on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a needle weenie, so that's not
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I keep telling, for those of
you that know Kelly Vance of Beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: Insectary, you know, he's got like an
insect sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep telling him those are my tattoos on
his body because I just, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggled getting my ears pierced a
second time, and now I completely regret
[SPEAKER_00]: it because I'm just such, I just don't do
needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Persimilis is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that aren't familiar,
Phytoselus Persimilis is a predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tropical species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's known for is feeding on
two-spot spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really got one job, and that's what
it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been used really heavily in
greenhouse vegetable production through
[SPEAKER_00]: the decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used very heavily in strawberry
production, especially in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Persimilis production in
California for that very reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the demands of the strawberry
producers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But several decades ago, and this was the
first commercial beneficial I worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 90s, was Persimilis and using it in
tropical foliage for spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it out, if there's spider mite
eggs, immatures, or adults, it eats them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if there's no food source,
they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a double-edged sword,
I don't know if that's the right word,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you are, let's say, a landscape
kind of person or a vegetable producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of want your predators to hang
around and have them on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing for ornamental
purposes, you're good with your
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials dying because you do not want
to send any plants to market with anything
[SPEAKER_00]: moving on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the palm growers are okay with all the
beneficials dying off, because even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they're beneficial, most people cannot
determine if something is a beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pest, or indifferent, which most things
you see are completely indifferent and
[SPEAKER_00]: benign from an agricultural context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would release them, they'd pass
away of starvation because they had
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically on a Persimilis program,
you're releasing about every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, BioBee in Israel has come up with a
new rearing system for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally how you rear Persimilis is you
have to grow a ton of spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once you have a ton of spider
mites, then you go sprinkle some
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilis out there, and then the
Persimilis multiply and multiply and
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply, and then when your whole
population is almost Persimilis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest them, you put them in bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a poor spider mite that survived
and you're in that bottle with 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilis, you're not even gonna make it
very long, because they're gonna eat you
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the product and then you
release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What BioBee has discovered is that they
can raise these predatory mites on
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the egg of another mite
species called Carpoglyphus, and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, instead of having to raise
all these spider mites, which have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: raised on plant material, the
Carpoglyphus, they don't have to raise on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harvest their eggs, and then
basically the eggs are like little protein
[SPEAKER_00]: bars, and they just feed them to the
Persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a more efficient way of raising
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that technology, what they're
able to do is then take sachets,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sachets that are used for other mite
systems are very different than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they put these Carpoglyphus eggs,
or dead mite eggs, in a sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, you've just set up a
sachet with a pile of protein bars in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put some Persimilis in there,
and then they've got two kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have what's called the speed release
product, which they say, if you just put
[SPEAKER_00]: that out, it just has Persimilis in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about five days, all the Persimilis
climb out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's a speedy release to get
them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get what they call the the
brand is Percy Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get the classic Percy Plus
sachets, right now, they think one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those sachets will release about 300
mites, oh, up to about 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting almost two weeks of
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that are used to working with
Cucumeris and Swirsky sachet, those last
[SPEAKER_00]: four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because in those, you actually have
a breeding system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got mites in there that are
breeding, that are feeding on fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's growing on brands, so it's
self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these systems, they just put the dead
mite eggs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's no mites to be breeding in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they run out of the mite eggs,
your breeding system's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still can give you two weeks of
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be important for crops that
you do not want carrier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's got those trichomes,
you don't want to see that carrier stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like petunia and calibrachoa
crops, things like that, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the heavy trichomes on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those are going to go to retail,
you don't want to see carrier sprinkled
[SPEAKER_00]: all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to give you that option
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this persimilis, you can buy in
bottle form, too, not just the sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you open the bottle and you look
in, you're going to be like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've attended in my workshops,
I've said it a million times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use color solely as
identification because we have different
[SPEAKER_00]: color morphs, insects and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors can be slightly different depending
on their food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Percy Plus, when it's reared on
these mite eggs, the persimilis are clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost like a milky, creamy color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask anybody what colors are
persimilis, they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, they're bright reddish orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're fed on this different diet,
they look completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I saw them, it was like
totally freaky because it's just I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: not used to seeing persimilis like
transparenty, creamy color.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting, though, is once they
start to feed on spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'll turn their red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a little potential here that
these could be a diagnostic-slash-scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: tool that if you put out all these clear
colored mites and then you start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: them turning red, they're finding spider
mites somewhere in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware that there's a lot you have to
understand about using the Percy Plus
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis over conventional persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing you have to be aware of is
when you buy conventional persimilis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again, amazing products out there,
when you buy them and they're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle, there has been no food in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy the red traditional
persimilis, so when you release them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you were locked in a room for
two days fasting, when you get out,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, you're going to be ready to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you release the traditional red
persimilis, and I watched this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of you heard me talk about
over my COVID vacation I had for a year
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting at home, I raised a lot of spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I released the traditional red
persimilis on there, man, they are right
[SPEAKER_00]: on it because they're so hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go right after the different life
stages and they just tear up the
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I release the Percy Plus,
they're like, oh, yeah, look, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just saunter around and kind of get
settled in because since they've got food
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottle and the sachet, they don't
come out of the bottle starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not necessarily a bad thing
because if you have a very, very low
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mite pressure or you're doing it as
a preventative, if you can release these
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-fed mites and you're going to be
releasing all life stages in those,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to live longer on your plant
so they can cruise around looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: mites longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red persimilis you get, those are all
adults you're getting, but they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way at this point, I kind of see it
and things may change as we use them more
[SPEAKER_00]: in growing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a current mite problem,
you've suppressed it with a nocturnal
[SPEAKER_00]: spray, but you still, man, we've got mites
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely at this point go with
the more traditional persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're being preventative and lots
of my growers are, man, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting persimilis out every two weeks,
it's that they do not have a spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Percy Plus may be a better way to go
because they're going to live longer on
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants because of becoming pre-fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say doesn't have a problem,
does that mean they aren't spotting any
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you walk around, yeah,
very low pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing is with my ornamental growers in
Florida, there is no such thing almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: low pressure down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're outside growing,
it's extremely warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a winter freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you have just such intense
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those guys in Florida,
they could be spraying for spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: every three days, where they typically are
releasing every two weeks persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're an indoor grow, you don't
have a history of spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: your pressure is going to be so much lower
down there or up there or over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are, that this may be a
better choice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've gotten spider mites into
your facility by bringing in cuts or
[SPEAKER_00]: unemployed clothing or somebody did
something and you've got a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular persimilis is probably the
better way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, talk to me in six months
because this might change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing about biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff I said even three to four years ago,
we know more now and it's not true
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we've got this constant,
we need to keep learning and trialing and
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and push ourselves so that we can
improve these programs and get smarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you have some exciting stuff
hopefully coming down the line too,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not quite at this stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always things, innovation
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's wonderful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's great to see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, I mean, well, I get
excited almost over any bug thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to have like this handful of new stuff
this year, it's really exciting to have
[SPEAKER_00]: new innovations and new ways to solve
growers' problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to see because BioBee has
been very forward thinking and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some really cool products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things which I posted about
on social media if you saw, they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: made Pokemon cards for all the biocontrol
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I love stuff like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the hemp show, man, I was right there
and I'll take one, one, one, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I snagged myself an entire deck of
them and I was out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way I was not getting a stack
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked about them at the show and
then BioBee got back to me and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh my God, after your talk,
they said their booth was like rushed
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody was down there trying to
get these cards and they gave every card
[SPEAKER_00]: away they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're getting requests for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a great idea because it's
a quick reference card on the beneficials,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, quick temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you release?
[SPEAKER_00]: And things you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's really cool like in a
Pokemon format.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is totally off topic, but I was just
talking with Ben the other day about how
[SPEAKER_02]: all the stuff that we saved as kids that
we thought would be worth something
[SPEAKER_02]: someday like baseball cards are not worth
anything and all the stuff that no one
[SPEAKER_02]: really saved like Pokemon cards,
I guess, are worth thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I look at it as if it was sold to be
a collectible, then nobody played with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's lots of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was sold to be played with and then
the kids all destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the valuable stuff is because
not many of them exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to talk about methods of
release, but is there any other like new
[SPEAKER_02]: products or innovation you want to cover
before we get into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I told you, I would be short
about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So banker plants, you know, this is more
of a regular practice and vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slowly creeping in here and there in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not really seen it executed
extremely well in cannabis yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some states won't even allow
banker plant systems to be used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is, as I mentioned before,
you're releasing all these beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no food, they starve to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the mites, things like
cucumber, some persimmon, they're not that
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into parasitoids and
these are the tiny little wasps that
[SPEAKER_00]: control aphids, it can get expensive if
you have to release them over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are these programs for using
plants that you grow aphids on and those
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids will not attack the crop you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it basically so when you release your
parasitoids, if they don't find any aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: in your crop you're growing, they can go
to these banker plants, find loads of
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, lay their eggs in the aphids
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those aphids, those parasitoids
emerge and then go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually building a population
in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many ornamental growers do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start these programs early spring
before the aphids even show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're rearing the parasitoids in
their greenhouses on these banker plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the aphids do show up in the
spring, they've got this whole army of
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids already there waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program that most people know about,
and you've been doing my workshop through
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it, there's a banker plant
system for Ophidias colmani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colmani is a parasitoid that controls,
and I'm going to give you like the air
[SPEAKER_00]: quotes, smaller aphid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it does green peach aphid really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cotton melon aphid really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it absolutely will parasitize the
cannabis aphid, the Fordon cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that everybody's having problems
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go running out and think this is a
magic silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cousin parasitoid, Ophidias irvi,
which is physically much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls larger aphid species like it
does potato aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does foxglove aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does the cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that the cannabis
aphid, when you start looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids that have been collected out
of it, there've been several of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily three of them are commercially
produced at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea with the new banker plant is
you can grow this larger aphid on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the larger aphid, which is a pea aphid,
and it is grown on fava beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the new banker plant system that's
coming to market raises Ophidias irvi,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fava beans with pea aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we have been using is barley with
a bird cherry oat aphid and raising
[SPEAKER_00]: Ophidias colmani.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's two banker plant systems
that allows you to raise two different
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids because the colmani typically
is not going to go over and parasitize the
[SPEAKER_00]: pea aphids and the larger parasitoid,
the irvi, is not going to go over and
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitize your bird cherry oat aphids
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there can be a little crossover,
but for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Irvine system is still very new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first year any of my growers
have tried it in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the pea aphids are super
cool because they're giant and they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful long legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love pea aphids, but if you
look at them and give them the side eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: they drop off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you touch the plant, they drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a behavioral thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to move banker plants,
or the pea aphids on the fava beans and
[SPEAKER_00]: you knock them, your aphids are going to
fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're on rolling benches that get
banged, your aphids are going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a bit of a challenge on
keeping aphids up on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they don't like extremely warm
weather and that can be true for the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids on the banker plant for the smaller
parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think there's potential there to
build up a colony, build up a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: these parasitoids in your cannabis
facility that both will go after cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any cannabis growers testing
this yet, but I think it's something we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to look at and see if it's
going to work in those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm a grower, what am I buying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I like raising these barley plants,
for example, and then buying the aphid,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pea aphid, or how does this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the smaller aphid banker plant
system, you actually buy, it's basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock wool, I think it's rock wool or
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a cube and it's barley is
already growing on it and it's loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: bird cherry oat aphids, which don't freak
out if some of the bird cherry oat can get
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your cannabis because they can't live
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growers are not physically going to be
able to tell bird cherry oat aphids apart
[SPEAKER_00]: from rice root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bird cherry doesn't live on cannabis
and the root aphids don't live on barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not moving back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you buy the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the larger aphid plant
banker system, basically you buy pea
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids by the gram that are shipped to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to have your fava beans or
pea plants already growing for when the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just inoculate them on the plant and
they go nuts on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For facilities that are open to the
outside, this is another really great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about these aphid banker plant
systems is it not only does it raise these
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids, it can also provide food for
a lot of your native beneficials that move
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often find like lacing larvae on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often find surfid flies on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because they come in from
the outside and are utilizing it as a food
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's fine because it's the immature
life stage that's eating the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pupate there and then
you're going to have a new adult in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that can go lay more eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so for those listening, I confused
the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pea aphid does not go with the
barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that backwards.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pea aphid goes with a fava bean or pea
plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bird cherry oat aphid goes on the
barley plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then- And one for smaller aphids and
one for bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're talking about banker
plants, the other one is aureus and purple
[SPEAKER_02]: flash pepper or something similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized we're not talking about,
we're talking about pollen sources at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be another potential banker
plant to mention for folks if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking banker plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to just spend a minute on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use a pepper plant to basically
provide pollen for aureus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aureus is a minute pirate bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent generalist predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly used for thrips management,
but also feed on spider mites and other
[SPEAKER_00]: soft-bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In outdoor hemp and cannabis production,
I find it naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little insect loves hemp and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is indoors, when you're in an
indoor grow, you can release them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but you don't have pollen for them
really to feed on because they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have pollen to be able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to have a minimum of 12
hours of light to throw that into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is this pepper plant then
provides the pollen for the aureus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, any of my cannabis growers that
have tried it, I find the little shriveled
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper plant in the corner of a bench
being neglected, that's the hardest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is either do banker plants or don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't half-ass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to commit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have somebody in charge of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, they don't get watered and
dried up and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't half-ass it and say banker plants
don't work unless you truly commit to it
[SPEAKER_00]: and do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: How far away from your crop can they be,
would be question number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then question number two is,
it sounds like you said in outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: situations, you don't necessarily need
banker plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would a greenhouse fall on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, greenhouses, we are using them in
there just to up our pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can still get outdoor
environmental pollen in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if the vents open and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really going to boost their
numbers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're even using these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been, again, to some of my
talks, metro line of greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using these peppers, alyssum,
and these other banker plants outside with
[SPEAKER_00]: mum production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because mums themselves, when we're
growing them at a growing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just all green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no pollen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're adding these even outdoors to
encourage the aureus to stay more locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our plants, even though pollen can blow
in from the environment, we're really just
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating it there for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still, I mean, we even use these
banker plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not, you are getting more
pollen, it sounds like, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study done looking at Swirsky
inside of a greenhouse and then outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: on a pepper crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they provided Swirsky supplemental
pollen because you can actually buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cattail pollen from like BioBest to
supplement feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found is indoors, in pepper
production, it made a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got an increase in the numbers
of Swirsky and predation on thrips and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, adding the pollen made no
difference because there was enough pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: already just in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how far away can these plants be for
aureus?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be pretty far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you have to look at and think
about is, so when you go into ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: and vegetable greenhouses, they're not
giant wind tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cannabis facilities, it's like
going into a hurricane, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to think about insects
trying to fly and move around in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the winds like that move your
pests amazingly also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have super high winds,
the aureus can travel huge distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a heavy wind, it's going
to be hard for them to fly upwind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to put more plants at the
head of the direction your wind is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not solely relying on these for
your control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a supplement to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say of all the cannabis
facilities, the distance is not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at, again, what we're
doing outside, we're doing these over
[SPEAKER_00]: about, I think, about 10 acres outside,
putting these banker plants and dotting
[SPEAKER_00]: them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to be a flying,
it's not going to be an issue for Ophidias
[SPEAKER_00]: colmani and Ophidias urvi and aureus in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichogramma, who we do not have a banker
plant system for, those are the egg
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitoids for caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't fly for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to do a ton of release points
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I shouldn't have used that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't fly for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said there's no banker plants for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just talking about when you
release them, you have to have a greater
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't just open a container in
the middle of your greenhouse and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of do that with the aphid
parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just open the bottle, set them out,
and let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to get them as close to
the plants as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just walk out your door and look at
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If parasitoids couldn't fly any kind of
distance, how are they going to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects have to be able to travel a
certain distance in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the most grows, it's not going to be
an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an issue where they're not going to
be able to get around unless you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these, again, hurricane-force winds
pushing them down to one end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any other products, innovation,
things to cover before we get into methods
[SPEAKER_02]: of release?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I do want to mention,
and remember, I'm not paid by any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bug Lady Consulting is completely neutral
on all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just bringing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But BASF has released, and unfortunately,
they were really going to promote this
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, but because of COVID,
it didn't really get rolled out,
[SPEAKER_00]: a velifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Velifer is an insecticide that contains
Bavaria bassiana, where it's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: strain than what is in botanogard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanogard contains the GHA strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bavaria bassiana and velifer is the
PPRI 5339 strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're finding you're using one
Bavaria product and you're not getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: results you expected, you may try a
different strain and different formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if it works better in your growing
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, you guys all know that
there's differences between the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the same thing, too,
with these microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different strains that perform
differently under different conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: target different pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to find the one that works
for your particular growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about this product is
the oil it is in has proven to be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: darn safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had anybody burn plants with it,
except when somebody tanks mixed velifer
[SPEAKER_00]: with stuff oil X.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot mix two oils together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will absolutely burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just straight up velifer as a contact
product for foliar things like thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it tank mixed with an IGR,
it can be really good with aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my growers has been looking at
it as a drench for root aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photos they showed me have been
pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be the be-all magical
answer for root aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it may work better in your system
than some of the other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think it's worth looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's really nice,
too, that BASF has done is they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: available from them compatibility with
biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you are releasing Cucameras
or using persimilis, and you want to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: velifer, and you're like, hey,
what's this going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have a chart available that
will tell you about compatibility with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is super useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most pesticide companies don't
provide that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: For folks that want to look that up,
velifer is spelled V-E-L-I-F-E-R.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more information on the BASF
side about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of did a perfect segue into
microbials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things, I know we want to
talk about methods of release,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things you want to talk
about was contaminated non-EPA regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Registered microbial products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we skip to that topic first,
since we're talking about miticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: insecticides, from a microbial
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, maybe I planned that segue there
for you, because I was going to make you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you did highlight this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get in, I want to highlight
this one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about trichoderma,
Bavaria bossiana, even mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: or any of these microbial products,
they're very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't just say, oh, I'm going to
apply Bavaria, or I'm going to apply
[SPEAKER_02]: trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not enough information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all different from different
suppliers, different growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people need to differentiate and
know exactly what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of leads into what you're
going to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked a long time with these
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say microbial, mostly what
we're going to talk about right now are
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal products, fungus that the intima
pathogenic ones are ones that kill
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I'm most interested in,
not as much the disease management ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, if you make a
claim that your product controls an insect
[SPEAKER_00]: or mite or kill anything, it has to be EPA
registered, unless you're making what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call the salad dressing products,
which are basically made out of essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oils that are on what we call the 25B
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the non-EPA registered products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means those products aren't
registered through the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the government figures is,
here's a list of inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a product,
you're not going to kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to poison the environment
and are letting people bring products to
[SPEAKER_00]: market that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you get some products on
the market, you'll see there's no EPA
[SPEAKER_00]: registration number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask them for any trial work,
they really have no data.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing to see is when they
actually spell insect names wrong on the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of unproven products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people are trying to do is sell
microbial products, not as pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as either soil inoculants or just not
claiming anything so that they feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying this kills insects,
wink, wink, nod, nod, and we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you any directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the EPA can't say anything to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to sell you Metarizium,
or we're just going to sell you Isaria or
[SPEAKER_00]: Hercitella or Bavaria, or claim it's a
soil inoculant, because the inoculants are
[SPEAKER_00]: not really being regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the past, we weren't really
using these microbial entomopathogens as
[SPEAKER_00]: soil inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's research that has come
out, like with Bavaria botiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the active ingredient in botanogard,
velifer, biosterous, that there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation to the roots with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people are trying to do is bring
these microbial products to market and
[SPEAKER_00]: scoot around the EPA, which I will just
tell you right now, you are taking such a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge risk doing that, because the EPA
products are highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they test them to make sure that
the purity for all this kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get all that information from
the company if you talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These non-regulated products, and where I
keep finding this is I walk into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis facility and I'll see just like a
bag laying there, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this one situation, the guy's
like, oh, well, I bought that at a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has like something you would print
at home, like a shipping label,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just would say like, you know,
one tablespoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product that we collected out in
Oregon, at a facility, we took it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grower had already been sprayed
this, spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That particular product that he'd already
been using in his facility actually
[SPEAKER_00]: contained a huge amount of human pathogen
in it, and he wasn't aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's very concerning is
when you get these products without any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide label, they don't tell you about
a protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy, again, any of the microbial
products, the Bavaria, the Botanogard,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those, you're gonna have to wear a
respirator, because even though Bavaria is
[SPEAKER_00]: not a human pathogen, you probably
shouldn't be breathing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These contain no warnings like that,
so the growers don't think they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wear proper protective equipment,
the PPE that's required on federally
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular product, the pathogen
that was in there was Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers are freaking out all the time
about failing microbial testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Aspergillus is one you are absolutely
failed for, and here it is being sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the plant by this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was contacted last year, maybe it was
early this year, by a grower in Vermont
[SPEAKER_00]: who asked me for directions on how to use
Metarizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metarizium is the active ingredient in Met
52, but they had just purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: Metarizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, what's on the label?
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, there is no label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked where they got it,
they sent me a website, and it's a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that was coming out of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not EPA registered, and all it was
is it just was labeled as Metarizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sent that off, and that particular
product contained, I can remember it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 15 or 25 different other fungal and
bacteria in that product, in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Metarizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Metarizium that was in there had
an extremely low, what they call the CFU
[SPEAKER_00]: quality forming unit from what they
claimed was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even that little bit of Metarizium in
there, less than 25% of it was viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here this person was just gonna spray
it, no protective equipment, and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know how to spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have easily, if they had
breathed this stuff, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, are you gonna fail your test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there plant pathogens in there that
can cause problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at another facility recently,
and they had ordered Metarizium off of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alibaba, those two samples are getting
tested right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also been ordering samples from
other companies that basically won't make
[SPEAKER_00]: any pesticidal claims, but they're selling
like Bavaria botiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're trying to scoot around
getting the EPA registered where the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: again has to be looked at because there's
such an appetite in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think all these growers that have
bought this stuff do not realize the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking with buying these products,
because they really don't understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: really this stuff needs to be EPA
registered, unless it truly is a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum and is not being applied for use
for insect management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, soil inoculum rates are way
lower than the insecticidal killing rates
[SPEAKER_00]: for these intimal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you buy a legit inoculum,
and spray it thinking it's gonna work with
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticidal, the rates are gonna be too
low, really, to get what you need for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super scary to me because I'm really
concerned someone's gonna end up really
[SPEAKER_00]: sick from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, please, please, when you're
gonna buy any of these microbial products,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria, Isaria, I know Metarizium is
nearly impossible to get unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ordering it from China through like
Alibaba or stuff, just I wouldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it, think about the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it, send the product off to a
lab to have it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna make a social media post to show
you guys the plate that came back from
[SPEAKER_00]: this Metarizium product being plated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a four-year-old sneezed on
the plate and all the different stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on the outer surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No product should look like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all really good points.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I wanna bring up too is
the risk of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what form of carrier they
may be using on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could also lead to having,
creating issues down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if there's any carcinogens
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand why people wanna
skirt these EPA regulations, because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really, really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to get a product EPA
registered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the 25B list is so
convenient for a lot of companies on that
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't get the level of research to
know, or the level of regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't know if the product's gonna
be as effective as they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't know if the product is
as safe as they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even with some of these 25B
products, I'm not convinced that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are totally safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, time oil, for example,
and some of these other ones, I think
[SPEAKER_02]: still have can be applied at
concentrations that I wouldn't want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing or around necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we talk about these
microbials, you're trusting the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that company may be trusting another
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, it's something
that I just think I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The risk is way too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go with an EPA registered microbial
product if you're going to use it,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if it has pesticidal effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you know, people are all like,
you know, don't want government
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this doesn't prove to you why we need
government regulation over these products,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what will convince people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is exactly why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, someone could potentially
die from one of these products because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, I mean, you could say
buyer beware, but this is why we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: EPA is to stop bad products like these
from being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, this, this whole industry
has sprung up basically because the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, I do not find any of
these products in ornamental or vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: production and never have in past,
but in the last two to three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: this has exploded in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to buy Metarizium,
Isaria, Bavaria, you want to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: product has an EPA registration number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a proof label on it that tells you
the protective equipment you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should tell you, you know, when you
apply this product, how long before you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding the cannabis industry,
you're not reading pesticide labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a facility not too long ago that
they were applying BT, it's really INSYS,
[SPEAKER_00]: for applied management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was the product they were
using and they were drenching their indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with is for outdoor use for ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a completely wrong label.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had taken the time to actually read
the label to see, one, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying this, is it on the label?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot use outdoor products
indoor, just like some indoor products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot use outdoor because the innards
are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not designed to be drenched on
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus gnats weren't even on the label
anywhere for what they were doing and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just completely the wrong label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a legit legal licensed grow,
but people aren't understanding pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to use them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't want to be the one that the
EPA makes an example out of because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen because the, you know,
ornamental and vegetable production
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and even cannabis facilities
are inspected and you don't want to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are using the wrong legal
stuff in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So read those labels, make sure that,
you know, it's EPA registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you should be able, if you have
a question, pick up the phone and call
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of this microbial weirdo stuff from
online, you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach anybody that can give you good solid
information like BioSafe, BioWorks,
[SPEAKER_00]: BASF, any of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reach people there to
answer your technical questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: these products and how to be safe about
applying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a friendly reminder, there's a
different BT for caterpillars than there
[SPEAKER_02]: is for fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you're looking at that when
you're buying your BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually two different
caterpillar strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the zaui and kristaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a strain for Japanese
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of different strains of
bacillus thuringiensis floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure lock and key
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get the right one for your
pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which leads you back to starting with
identification as the very first step in
[SPEAKER_02]: any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a friendly reminder on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen when you talk, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pick up things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes me a little while, but I'll get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, as anybody, I mean,
besides knowing I love Harry Potter,
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs and Star Trek, ID is probably one of
the most important things I've preached in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to ID what your problem is
before you treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I've tried to send you photos
of things like aphids in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I need a better photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to really see those genitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you really dive in because you can't
necessarily tell things apart without very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific key indicators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I guess I just realized
more and more how complicated it is to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the right identification, because you've
already talked about how there's different
[SPEAKER_02]: parasitoids for different aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as simple as a one size fits all
with a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you right now,
cannabis growers, if there was a mite in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil, it is not strilolaps schematis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every mite picture that is getting put on
social media, everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's strats.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put out a bunch of strats and you
had a ton of food for them, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With any living soil, with any compost,
anything like that, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil has living things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see mites in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're helping decompose things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a black and white,
you know, is that mite good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of them that are,
you know, indifferent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just living in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hurt in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not predatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's tons of them in there that do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot just take a picture with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot put it on your cell phone and
post it on Facebook and expect someone to
[SPEAKER_00]: ID it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nobody that can do that on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mites are really hard to ID, let alone
soil dwelling mites where there hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been a ton of research done, let alone
cell phone images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, you know, I'm working with mite
ID, most of the time I have to send stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: off and the stuff has to be slide mounted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look at all those details on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Facebook is not going to give you ID
answers on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the short answer is if you see a
mite on your soil, you don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily freak out unless you're
starting to see excessive amounts of them
[SPEAKER_02]: where their populations are just exploding
or if you're seeing plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to soil mites and
cannabis, and so far, I nor anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a trained entomologist have seen
bulb mites in cannabis, even though,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, people are seeing their bulb mites
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulb mites in bulb crops can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any soil dwelling mites, I haven't
seen cause any economic problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you could have root disease and you
don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the secondary mites move in that
are eating your dead decaying roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: people think they're the prime area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the secondary showing up and
taking advantage of decaying plant matter
[SPEAKER_00]: where normally it's a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the initial problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be very hard to tease that
all apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't seen any mites in cannabis
production to this day in the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: have caused any economic loss in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's that's good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that I I see the most of in
living soils would be the isopods,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then springtails where I see
explosions of populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two things I've had people
reach out to me with where they just see
[SPEAKER_02]: massive, massive amounts of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to touch on
either of those since we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the interesting thing about springtails is
it's not one species, they're multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're an anetherium grower in
Europe, springtails can be a pest and feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on your roots there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there have been some
agricultural losses of seedlings out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, which crop it was again from
springtails feeding on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what we're seeing in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's multiple species of
springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, can springtails be a pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have we seen them be of a problem in
cannabis to cause economic damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have to be very specific
about your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing the crop where you're located,
all these different kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not gotten into springtail
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lord, that's a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some springtail nerd
somewhere on the planet that'll be more
[SPEAKER_00]: than happy to help you with ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, that's not anything
I worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing in the soil from an
arthropod kind of standpoint that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about is fungus gnats,
because they eat your roots, they vector
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, you just don't want them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are very manageable if you treat
them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, beneficial nematodes are amazing
at controlling them when you get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product and you plant correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the beetles, there's mites,
there's all kinds of things you can treat
[SPEAKER_00]: them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And root aphids, root aphids are the oh my
gosh, you're not going to sleep tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have root aphids because
they're very hard to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, there's some weird
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had fire ants feed on cannabis,
we've had some cutworm situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few root knot nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this new situation with the
tobacco ringspot virus that's vectored by
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes that has just been found in a
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's vectored by plant parasitic
nematodes, completely different than
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar pests are probably going to
take you out before any of the root pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in hemp outdoors, we've had a few
weevil issues in the soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But root aphids are the ones that are
really the only thing to freak out about
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil from an indoor growing
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about excessive levels of isopods?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, roly poly bugs, pill bugs,
whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's self-inflicted too much organic
matter in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, the American way,
if a little something's good, more is
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the populations just build and build
and build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've absolutely seen them eating the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to people that they're out
there vacuuming them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost honestly kind of need to change
your growing system because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: sustaining them by having too much organic
matter in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for talking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on to a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know we've been talking for a
while now, but can we just quickly go over
[SPEAKER_02]: methods of release?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you kind of highlighted a little
bit when he's talked about sachets,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there may be people that don't even
know what a sachet is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know the best way to approach
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk about a few different
insects, or if you just wanted to pick one
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial insect and then talk about the
different ways it could be released and
[SPEAKER_02]: why that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about two predatory
mites, and then we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think those are the things that
I see screwed up applied incorrectly the
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump back to persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilis, there is so many ways to apply
persimilis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, back in the 90s,
it would just come in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would sprinkle it out on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of that still going on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on plant shape, depending
how you grow, if you sprinkle over the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, you're going to lose a lot of those
persimilis to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really cringe when people say,
oh, just pour the persimilis at the base
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find their way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if my mom's taken me to the
mall, I wanted to drop me at the mall,
[SPEAKER_00]: not six blocks from the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to take an awful lot of
work to get to the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them where your pests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next progression from those
bottles on the persimilis is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: vial with the nipple top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you've been to any of my
workshops, you've been to any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, you guys have all heard me talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'm holding one in my hand right
now as we speak, because I keep it on my
[SPEAKER_00]: desk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vial about the size of a roll of
quarters, and it looks like the top of a
[SPEAKER_00]: ketchup bottle, the nipple top ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hold this, persimilis will run up
to the tip of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you can do is you just walk
along and touch the plant, and persimilis
[SPEAKER_00]: goes right out onto the plant and will
start feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you can see how many mites are
going on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no waste to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no carrier on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite way to apply persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been around a long time,
but I swear, I feel like this was made for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, even though we've
been using it in the interior plantscape
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're treating palm trees and malls
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using this product for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this application method is a really
good way to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we've never had persimilis
and sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to get these sachets that
have the quick release.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I like BioB, I'm not sold on
the quick release sachet, because
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, I'd rather, instead of hanging a
sachet on every plant and then dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with sachets for the quick release,
I'd rather just use the vial and walk down
[SPEAKER_00]: and touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the slow release sachet may have
something there, even though it only lasts
[SPEAKER_00]: for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally, you only apply
persimilis every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have to look at your
economics if you want to hang the sachets
[SPEAKER_00]: out for two weeks, or again, you want to
come through with the vial every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to look at your
situation and see what works for you in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are starting to see more drone
releases for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it in strawberries and
citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now ParaBug has been working with
Beneficial Insectary out in California
[SPEAKER_00]: doing outdoor drone releases, where they
put the persimilis in the drones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they fly them out and drop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically kind of how you would
do loose mites for production out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about Cucumeris,
which is a different predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I love Cucumeris, not as much as
persimilis, but it is a freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's nice about it is it has a wide host
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only will it gobble up onion thrips,
western flower thrips, it will destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: broad mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavily used in ornamental production
to prevent broad mite damage on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of my consulting customers,
you're most likely using Cucumeris in your
[SPEAKER_00]: program because it's a cheap, easy
insurance policy against these pests I
[SPEAKER_00]: just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to we know it will snack on
spider mites and spider mite eggs out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good general mite to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that same fast running up
behavior like persimilis does,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you cannot get it in the release vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get the product loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loose or in a sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the loose product, again, I'm not
super excited about putting it over the
[SPEAKER_00]: tops of plants, especially cannabis plants
that are large because you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a lot to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in plug trays, like if you've just
stuck all your cannabis cuts into like a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 20 flat, before you put the jiffy dome
on, you could just sprinkle in there
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly, you know, a tablespoon or so of
Cucumeris, which I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to start your bios in
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not wait people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start them then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pennies to treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's going to start feeding on
all those pest problems then before they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your plants are that small,
it's not that far for them to walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sachets, which we've talked about,
you can also do those in propagation and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use those on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cucumeris comes in that sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slow release sachets, they almost look
like tea bags and either come with a hook
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're on a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a breeding colony of Cucumeris in
there and mites will slow release out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pinhole in there for four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage of doing that is if you
hang these in your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having to come through every
week or every other week to loose sprinkle
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumeris and everything, get it on the
floor, make a mess, you just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally slow-releasing population coming
out and it works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absolutely use those sachets in
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the propagation cycles are
pretty short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes if you stick them in there
and then you're going to be transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, two, three weeks maybe,
don't give me all kinds of complaints
[SPEAKER_00]: about that's not your time on average
because everybody roots differently and
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, here you put that sachet in
and let's say if you're stepping up the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in two weeks, now you've got the
sachet that you still have several weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: still left on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either put it in new propagation
trays or you can just step them up with
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop because you want to make sure
you get that full use out of the sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these sachets on the plants have
really been a game changer as far as labor
[SPEAKER_00]: savings and also having that consistent
slow release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got these sachets,
you can absolutely come through and spray
[SPEAKER_00]: with products like mPede, SulfoilX,
any of the Botanogard, the Velifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the breeding colony is protected
inside that sachet, even if the product
[SPEAKER_00]: you use like SulfoilX is non-selective,
it will kill predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will kill them on the foliage when
you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those mites are going to start
releasing still out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once your SulfoilX is dry,
any of those mites that emerge afterwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, are still going to continue to
be able to live on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray and it doesn't disrupt
the releasing in your system as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spraying with products that are
somewhat compatible with biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally in cannabis and organic
production, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those release sachets have really been
a game changer on releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other release thing I want to talk
about are beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I was just about to post on my
Facebook page, which is for Bug Lady
[SPEAKER_00]: Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't send me personal friend
requests to Suzanne Wainwright,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where I do my cat,
dog, and Star Trek and Harry Potter stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bug Lady Consulting is where I put the
links.
[SPEAKER_00]: But BASF has done a really good video on
how to apply nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of people saying they're
applying nematodes for fungus neck control
[SPEAKER_00]: and not getting the results, I think
because they're not applying them
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different ways to apply
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to look at your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial production, the most
standard way to do it is people mix the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes up in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they use a dosatron to apply them
out so they get even dosing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that video that Jen Berg did explains
that, which explains exactly how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: for smaller facilities or home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, people are buying sponges,
because you can get smaller counts on
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to wring them out in things
like watering cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to make sure that your
nematodes are about the same temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: as your water you're mixing them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have that pretty close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you use them up as
soon as you mix them, because nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: can drown in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to let the water heat up,
because that can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with your nematodes too,
again, I really like people to buy direct
[SPEAKER_00]: from the infectories so that you're
getting the freshest, the most viable
[SPEAKER_00]: product as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes the distributors,
you don't know if they've stored the
[SPEAKER_00]: products correctly or how long they've
even had the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that kind of give you an overview?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you talk about ones that come with
carriers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say almost all biocontrol
agents come with carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even you can buy it in vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy it in brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different carriers for different
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you're dealing with a legit
biocontrol company, they'll know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ordering blindly off the
internet, who knows what you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a spice shaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was 10 years ago now when I had
thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was shaking out these little granules
onto my vegetative plants at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know if you wanted to touch
on that method of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're probably putting out
Cucumeris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you're probably losing a lot to
the floor that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you should have done is once you've
got your tube, you lay it on its side for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never want to stand bottles up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always lay them on their side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you roll it slowly to
reincorporate the mites back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you should have opened the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you should have been able to get
what they call release boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically these little square
pop-up boxes with a hanger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hang them in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you walk by with basically a
spoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would put a tablespoon of that in
these little boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mites over the next day to
two days will slowly climb out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes and onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, you get all your mites on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have carrier everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have carrier everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know you 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the sachets just make so
much sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me if this is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a really bad pest problem,
you'd probably do a knockdown spray and
[SPEAKER_02]: then follow it up with a release or with
sachets.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you lean towards?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that every situation is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a general rule, when are you doing
more of a quick release versus a sachet
[SPEAKER_02]: option for a lot of these insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at how long before the crop is
being shipped or harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at population density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also look at threats from other pests
that may show up that we may have to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is that going to interfere with
our other program?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start in propagation with your
plants, that's when they should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in with low rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in those plug trays,
you can use loose products right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you use an aerocloner, again,
you probably don't want to dump carrier
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where using sachets may make
better sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's like ideal when people root in
10, 20 flats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you sprinkle it on and they
just land on the surface, like the glue
[SPEAKER_00]: plug or the rock wool or whatever they're
using, there's so many plants right there
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to bump into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I would use the loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even though I realize most of growers
are going to be cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we're growing, let's say,
basil pot tight on a growing bench and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a four inch pot, we may broadcast
over the top of that because the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are touching and it makes it difficult for
the canopy and most of the mites are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up on the plants and not losing
them to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually look at leaf structure too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants like crotons, it's a tropical
foliage plant, super big wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally use an orchard air blaster to
blow mites out because they've got big
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that can catch the mites and then
it slides them down towards the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and they don't fall through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at a cannabis plant that's
really, especially if they've been thinned
[SPEAKER_00]: out, they're open, they're leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you blow mites over the top of
that, they're just going to kind of fall
[SPEAKER_00]: through and fall right to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant structure makes a difference too
on deciding how we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're already running a little long,
but I want to put you on the spot here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you answer two things in the next two,
three minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be one, why it's important
to vet the entomologist that you work with
[SPEAKER_02]: or let's just say, not even use the word
entomologist because I'll let you touch on
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but the, I guess, IPM expert that
you work with or consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also why every environment is
different and there's no, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect answer that works for all
situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just, I know this could be a whole
nother podcast, but I wanted to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: in because I think it's important if you
could just touch on those really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so again, in my background,
it's a bit more, in the ornamental market
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's only a couple of us that are
consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't very many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're a consultant, you're a
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have other revenue streams and
we've gone to college for this and do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started working a lot more in the
cannabis industry and I discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's a consultant and I would ask
people, you know, what are your
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifications?
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, well, I grew weed for a
year, so now I'm going to be a weed
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important to ask
if someone is giving you advice or
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying something for you,
look at what their qualifications are to
[SPEAKER_00]: be giving you this information because I'm
finding there's just so much bad
[SPEAKER_00]: information being given out and people can
say whatever they want about their
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can call yourself whatever I
could call myself a zoologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I didn't go to school for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I think it's important to dive into
people's backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they go to college or these
specialized areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you could be a very good
grower without going to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into these specialized
niches of entomology or pathology or
[SPEAKER_00]: nematology, the reality is you need to
have gone to school for this and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and worked in the field and kept up with
all the scientific information because if
[SPEAKER_00]: not, if the people you're getting
information from don't, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up getting bad information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, unfortunately I've
learned and it's been frustrating for me
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis is kind of a social media
popularity contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is, is I'm sorry,
guys, I don't have a ton of time to put up
[SPEAKER_00]: all these flashy social media stuff
because I'm out in the field working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, doing experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm photographing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I rely on you, Tad,
because you basically kind of are my
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get me out there because I just don't
have time for, and I always say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got all this time to be on
producing all this social media content,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are you actually working and doing a
job?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, just, just fire, beware on the
information you get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check, you know, what people's
qualifications are.
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how many jobs they've had,
where they've worked and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to answer your question on
environment, it's just like, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it too with medications,
actually COVID vaccines perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people have gotten the COVID
vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all responded differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them out, they can respond
differently in different environments
[SPEAKER_00]: where it may work here, where it doesn't
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're dealing with living,
breathing organisms, there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to test and see which one is right
for your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a pretty good idea because
of doing this like 30 years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the good starting point, and we're going
to tweak it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the environment, you know,
workflow, you know, is there a soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: field outside your facility or are you
next to a building?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these kinds of things play
in to how we formulate your pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is for my growers to have
solid, environmentally safe and cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective pest management programs because
if your program's not cost effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're not going to be my customer
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need you guys to stay in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to touch on a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I think that if you were a
large facility, you could potentially save
[SPEAKER_02]: them money by dialing in their programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a small facility,
you could actually save them money by
[SPEAKER_02]: calling in their program or decreasing the
amount of pest damage that they're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be buying too much of a given a
given product, or maybe there's a better
[SPEAKER_02]: product out there that you could
recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every situation is so unique,
as you mentioned, you know, varying in
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, humidity, stage of plants,
airflow, all of these things that it
[SPEAKER_02]: really does require a lot of experience
and background in order to make a good
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note, I know I'm going to get
pushed back on the fact that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to go to college to know
something about about a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm the perfect example of that
when it comes to my background,
[SPEAKER_02]: since my background is in special
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get a master's degree for what
that's worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do I do think there is a huge
advantage to going to school now for those
[SPEAKER_02]: people that didn't go to school or didn't
have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's there are wonderful
people in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Kelly Vance is a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great example of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has a lot of experience as a large
scale greenhouse grower prior to ever
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into insects and then spent a lot
of time doing work with insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be aware that, you know, you'll even
see variability within these insectaries
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of the level of knowledge that
they have or these companies selling
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of the recommendations on
there versus the ones that you're you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you and I have talked about them,
and sometimes they don't really line up as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really do vet your information and make
sure that you're optimizing it for the
[SPEAKER_02]: health of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing research on something doesn't
mean Googling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see this growers like,
well, I researched this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, how did you research it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you Googled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much bad, wrong information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, I could write a whole book
on bad pest management information on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis on the Internet or a coffee table
book on the wrong identification of things
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, I don't know all insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try my best and I'm trying to improve
constantly by learning, doing more,
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbing shoulders with, you know,
the histimists that are specialists in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as growers, you have to be good at
lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a way, don't yell at me,
but master of none in a way, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys have to be able to handle all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it to the specialist when you're
getting down to the very specifics on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this that we can help you with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, Ted, I did have one of my
consulting customers in Las Vegas contact
[SPEAKER_00]: me a week after the visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that in the changes they
implemented just from my being there the
[SPEAKER_00]: one day, it already paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saved so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It paid for all my me coming out,
my consulting fee, travel and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: for what they saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a huge money saver for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's have a good program, but yet be cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for me, environment,
the environmental issues is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to reduce pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people to be exposed to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want more pesticides in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're hiring a consultant
for anything, they need to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be aware of what that
value is prior to ever having them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people that want me to come out
and see their facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of times I'll be
like, hey, you know, maybe a zoom call
[SPEAKER_02]: would be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not the right person for what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like in your case,
if you step into a facility, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times you'll see things that they might
not be able to put in a call or an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd be like, oh, my gosh,
you know, hey, you're storing this product
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong or oh, geez, you need to have some
sort of, you know, IPM protocol for going
[SPEAKER_02]: into this room that you don't have
established right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little things can save thousands of
dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where a consultant can make
a big difference and getting the right
[SPEAKER_02]: consultant, because there's no there's no
list of consultants out there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: canvas industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no ratings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really it's really your job as the
grower to go out there and vet them and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you're getting the right person
for what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being on on on site is critical because
you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I if you call me and ask me
about disease, you know, my answer is it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have six or eight legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Tad, you know, from knowing me,
if I don't know about it, I know who does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get you connected with the right
person that does know about that area of
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty that can help you then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing I'm very grateful
for, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that network of people,
because if it relates to insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can get a hold of you if it
relates to, you know, pathology or
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could talk to Chris Hayes over at
Bioworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's there's there's Dr.
Greenhouse, Nadia, who's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to airflow and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, having the network is almost
more important than your own personal
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge in a lot of cases when it comes
to consulting, I found, or just being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to find answers for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and this is an advantage to me being
like an old person because I've only ever
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in the horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've got almost over 30 years in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband's been in the industry even
longer than I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between my husband and myself,
I think we all know almost everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't know the specialist,
he knows the specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, I have no problem passing
people on to get the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like even if like an
eggplant person honestly calls me and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, hey, we have a commercial
eggplant production greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass them on to a vegetable
specialist for greenhouse, because I try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay out of vegetable production for
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my areas and I know when to hand
them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot be a master of all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great that's a great way
to end the podcast since we're already
[SPEAKER_02]: going a little long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you and I love to chat anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the sake of the listeners,
let's let's call it a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope to stay in touch with you and
get you back on here again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking with you and I appreciate
you giving me a platform to get my
[SPEAKER_00]: message.

will talk to you soon.
