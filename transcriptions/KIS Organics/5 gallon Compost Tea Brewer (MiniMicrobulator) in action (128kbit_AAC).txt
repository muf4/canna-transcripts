[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today to demonstrate for you the
five gallon mini-microbulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a five gallon aerated compost tea
brewer or bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an airlift design and it was
manufactured originally by Tim Wilson of
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbe Organics up in Canada and he
recently gave us the right to start making
[SPEAKER_00]: it here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really simple design, very,
very efficient and makes wonderful compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we want to make compost tea
ourselves is because we want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: By making it yourself, you can ensure that
you're getting good biological activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy stuff in the bottle,
it's not going to have that same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity and diversity and you're not
going to get the same biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important that we make compost
tea fresh because what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: creating nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're extracting the microbes from our
compost, adding a food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this just creates the optimal
environment by getting the most oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can into the water, which is where
all those microbes are because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: select for aerobic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, to use this brewer,
we're just going to set it down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and I've already dechlorinated this
water by leaving it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have chlorine here in the Seattle
area so I don't need to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I have to do is let it sit out and
this water has been sitting here for like
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five days because I've been so
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also run the brewer for six to
eight hours and that should take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really usually smell the chlorine,
which is a good way to tell if it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, or use rainwater or some other
source that's already had the chlorine or
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine removed or never had it in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've just secured this unit
to the bottom using a bungee cord that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just holds everything in place and then
all I need to do at this point is plug it
[SPEAKER_00]: in to get it going and I'm just going to
plug it in so you can hear about how loud
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the air pump needs to stay above the
height of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important so you can have it
on a desk or somewhere nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't come with the buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with everything else so we can
ship it much more affordably, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really easy to pick up a bucket at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work with any five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm going to plug it in here
and give you an idea of just how noisy it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll probably want to run it in your
garage or in your greenhouse, not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily in your kitchen or in your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's it running and I'm
just talking to give you an idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of volume that you're hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stick something underneath the air
pump to help reduce some of the air pump
[SPEAKER_00]: noise, but really most of the noise is
just the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that the water makes
that noise because what it's doing is it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breaking the surface tension of the
water which raises your dissolved oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once it's running, if you have one of
our brew kits, you're using our compost
[SPEAKER_00]: key, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do at that point is take
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our food source here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the micro catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small amount of organic alfalfa
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that and sprinkle it right into
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set that aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is the compost portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already pre-measured this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already free to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone ahead and cut the cable tie that
holds this closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using our other five gallon
extended life system, you'll want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the mesh in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are using this system,
you'll want to take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm doing now is dumping the
compost into the bag or into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let that go now for 24 to 36
hours and then I can apply it to all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about compost key is you
can't overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I said you can't overwater,
but you can't over apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a wonderful way to get additional
beneficial microbes right into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have additional questions about
compost tea, please check out our blog
[SPEAKER_00]: post.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 17 page guide that's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right on our website on our blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to unplug that so you guys can
hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say we do have a
compost tea guide available for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 17 page guide right there on our
website so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should answer any and all of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to give you an idea of the
microbialator in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
