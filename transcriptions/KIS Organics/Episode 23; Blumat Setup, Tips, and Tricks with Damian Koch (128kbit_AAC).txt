[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is a follow up podcast
on Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hadn't had a chance yet,
please go back and listen to the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast with Steve Troy to get a bit of
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Mats use no electricity and are an
affordable way to improve the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast, I go into depth with
Damian, one of the employees over at Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: On exactly how to set them up properly,
as well as tackle the common user
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and feedback I got after the
first Blue Mats podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to the show, send us an
email at TAD at KISOrganics.com if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested and we will help you get a
setup for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can view Damian's contact
information directly on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to mention that you heard
about them on our podcast and now onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thanks Damian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you taking the time today to
chat a little bit more about Blue Mats and
[SPEAKER_00]: do a follow up podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, sounds great to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to just dive right in here
since we covered a lot in the last podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk about dialing in the Blue Mats
since we've already covered kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they are and what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a little overview here
starting with, we talked a little about
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking the Blue Mats to get all the air
out of the carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just go from there and move forward
with how you prep them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's kind of changed a little bit
over the years in terms of kind of priming
[SPEAKER_01]: and prepping those Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, Austria kind of wanted us to
do it for I think 12 hours underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the last few years, just running
more tests and everything, we just
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that you want to just soak that
ceramic cone until it's basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: porous enough where water is both in and
outside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's just 15 minutes without
the cap on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cap is that little green top that
goes, that you screw on the Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to do just 15 minutes
underwater without the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then while it's in your bucket or bowl
of water, whatever it might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just screw that back on just so
that for another 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really just because the way that
a Blue Mats is working is it's constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: reading kind of the pressure within the
Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as you get that ceramic
cone to just be porous enough with water,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why 15 minutes without the cap,
15 minutes with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make sure that,
yeah, you don't get as few air bubbles
[SPEAKER_01]: within the Blue Mats out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be, I know the really kind of
master way to do it is using a little
[SPEAKER_01]: pipette to kind of squeeze water within
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I just use my thumb to kind
of push water within.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people use an eyedropper too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really kind of comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not 100% necessary, even if
there's a few bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to kind of ruin the
function of the Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we believe with zero bubbles in
there, you kind of get the best accuracy
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning the Blue Mats is going to react
and respond better to kind of those
[SPEAKER_01]: outside factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll know when the pressure outside of
it, meaning if the soil around the Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Mats gets a little drier, then it'll be
able to read that quicker and start
[SPEAKER_01]: dripping water and get it back to that
kind of prime watering zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's always really important
that I always tell people is you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that you're not putting in the
Blue Mats when the soil is either too wet
[SPEAKER_01]: or too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're basically setting the Blue
Mats, that whole default setting of
[SPEAKER_01]: turning it two little triangles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all there in the instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is when the moisture level is
at its kind of prime point, at its best
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you set it when it's too dry,
the Blue Mats is going to kind of keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: at that dry level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I like to tell people is just
either overnight or a few hours before,
[SPEAKER_01]: hand water it how you'd normally do so
that there's enough water throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire container, not just on the top
versus the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really important factor is
making sure you're priming that Blue Mats
[SPEAKER_01]: into that ideal moisture level because
that's what the Blue Mats is going to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to keep it at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with our soils, I like people to
water the soil really slowly because there
[SPEAKER_00]: is peat moss in there and it can get
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a matter of watering a little bit
of water at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's over a period of a few hours to
get that moisture content to the optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, which in our soils, again,
we aim for 100 mbar, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: vary depending on the soil that you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have your soil at that level,
which those moisture meters, the digital
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meters are excellent for telling
you when you're at that, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start looking to actually set up and dial
in your Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I want to point out,
and maybe you can correct me on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is when I was talking to Steve originally,
he was saying that you want to attach the
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Mat to like screw it back together
underwater and kind of knock the two
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces to get any bubbles out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd mentioned using a pipette.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you use the pipette?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the pipette, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just essentially underneath the Blue
Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have it underwater,
and I mean, even if you have it above
[SPEAKER_01]: water, if you unscrew it and look at the
little cap, there's these three small
[SPEAKER_01]: looking little ovals almost on the other
side of the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what tends to happen is water will
sometimes not get into those parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning there's basically an air bubble
underneath these three little holes that I
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: on the cap of the Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing you do with the pipette
is essentially just squeeze water into
[SPEAKER_01]: those three parts, basically pushing any
air bubbles away and out of the Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way you kind of described is the
alternative where you kind of shake any
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what I mentioned is basically pushing
water with your thumb inside the,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the same function as the pipette.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pipette just kind of really lets you
know for sure that you pushed water into
[SPEAKER_01]: there and that there's not going to be any
air bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not 100% necessary, but for kind
of 10 cents, it might not be a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you just have some pipettes laying
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been going down to the store and
getting distilled water for soaking my
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Mat to make sure that there's no
other particles or anything else that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be in my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that overkill or even necessary?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could say it is overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people that do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alternative is honestly just boiling
water because that's going to do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing with distilled water is
you know there isn't anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no sediments in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that any of the kind of oxygen
has already been, there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: any oxygen bubbles within the distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes if you just pour water
directly from your sink or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: then there is going to be a lot of air
bubbles in that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say yeah, it might be a little
overkill just because you're paying for
[SPEAKER_01]: more for just clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have distilled water around or
anything like that, then you certainly can
[SPEAKER_01]: use that as an alternative to just boiling
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now we've taken the two pieces of
the Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've connected them underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made sure there's no air bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next step in the process for
setting them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so the next step is once we have
your Blue Mat primed with water and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: already porous throughout the whole thing,
the next thing would be getting your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of what you were mentioning
before, slow watering soil just to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: that water to within the soil to really
kind of just move around to all the places
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know your soil is pretty amazing to use
with Blue Mat, but Blue Mat can work with
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of different types of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just may have to kind of be adjusted
differently or you might have to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: account for if a soil is really good at
spreading that moisture versus retaining
[SPEAKER_01]: it, then you might want to kind of just
prime the Blue Mat a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I mean prime, I mean there's a
step, the next step would be putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil and then turning,
you essentially open up the Blue Mat so
[SPEAKER_01]: water's flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You connect it to your water source so
that water is actually going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the top of the Blue Mat,
there's these, what I call a little brown
[SPEAKER_01]: cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that little cap actually, if you look
into it, it has these little, not into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the outside, there's these little
triangles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you're kind of using it
to control your Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic instructions, setup
instructions in the manual is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: you open up the carrot so that water's
flowing out and then you slowly close it
[SPEAKER_01]: until what we call there's a hanging drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that essentially means that water is
just on the edge of that small three
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeter drip tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water's found out on that very edge
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not falling and it's not going
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of standing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you close the Blue Mat,
another two triangles, which is about a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of the full radius of the brown
cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that two carrot or the two triangles,
that's essentially allowing it so the Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Mat is gonna stay closed until the soil
dries up enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's gonna open up the Blue Mat
and it's gonna allow water to kind of feed
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you kind of have some
leeway is those, changing those different
[SPEAKER_01]: triangles, either opening it or closing it
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally for a no-till kind of grill
where you want more moisture, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to close it the full two triangles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do one triangle or even one and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just means that the Blue Mat is
gonna be a little more responsive in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of it's gonna start watering sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more you close it, the less it's
gonna water frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more open you leave those
triangles, the more water is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: entered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the default way of setting it is after
you take, let's say your Blue Mat's are
[SPEAKER_01]: still in your bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your soil is at the ideal
moisture level you want it to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: retain or stay in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you take that Blue Mat,
you put it into the soil, you connect it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the eight millimeter tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you open up the Blue Mat to make
sure water is flowing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you close it with a little brown
cap until there's what we call the hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water is just found at the tip of the
tubing, the three millimeter tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you close it another two
triangles, which is about a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation of the brown cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you leave it there, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want, you can connect
distribution drippers to it or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just allow it to come off that three
millimeter tubing directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I found what works best for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important point you
brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was attaching the distribution drippers
or the Blue Soak Tape prior to dialing in
[SPEAKER_00]: my Blue Mat, which is a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna just keep that three millimeter
line empty and not attach anything until
[SPEAKER_00]: you do that hanging drop step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found going back one carat,
it works pretty well with our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, living soils,
you want them to be a little bit wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a optimal, or general level
for people say using cocoa or out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional garden or an outdoor setup
that you might offer them as a guideline,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the 100 MBAR that I really like
with our soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I found, especially using our
digital moisture meters are really gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of allow you to get that perfect
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we've talked about this before,
Ted, we're kind of discussing the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a really expert grower,
and you've been growing for years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you really know kind of the type of
moisture level you want on your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who can easily just grab a
handful of their soil and then determine,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the perfect level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone like me or others who just wanna
have an actual digital reading of it to
[SPEAKER_01]: really make sure, then our digital
moisture meters work really well for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've looked, and this is what we
talked about prior, is we looked on other
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture meters found on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: On like Amazon or just on Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we bought them and tried them out
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they work fine for just being able to
determine if it's too wet or too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're kind of asking is finding
that optimal moisture level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with our digital moisture meters,
usually the range that I'm telling people
[SPEAKER_01]: is between 120 and 150.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 130 works really well,
especially with a cocoa blend or even just
[SPEAKER_01]: regular just peat moss types of grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing when you're setting your
bloom add up, is you wanna make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of putting it at a zone where
it's not gonna give you an incorrect
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by saying this, I mean, don't put it
next to these huge perlite chunks or in
[SPEAKER_01]: the very corner of your pot where it's
gonna obviously sense the moisture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual fabric pot or the clay pot,
whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna put it in a zone where there's
plenty of soil to surround it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of what I was saying,
not where there's a really high ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite or just other stuff that might
affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cocoa, since cocoa, I know a lot of
growers are using mix of cocoa or even
[SPEAKER_01]: just pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It retains moisture really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could almost go a little higher up
to 150 or even 180 if your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering where it's using even less
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the 150 range is great if
you tend to like your plants having more
[SPEAKER_01]: water or if the soil requires more water,
like a living soil, no-till grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that 100 works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would agree with you on that point
that the 100 works great for your spot of
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple things I wanna highlight from
what you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we're going from a water
source, just backing up a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're using a main line or plumbed
line, we will need to add in a pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: reducer right at the beginning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can run splitters off of that
to set up the rest of your line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that eight millimeter line,
which is what would come off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure reducer, or if you're using a
reservoir with a bulkhead connector,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do it that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go from there down to your carrot
and then you can sort of create your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden setup based off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I wanted to mention when
we were setting up, I noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I would do all of those steps,
turn on the water and then nothing would
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the blue mat, even though I've
opened up that top dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something Jaya told me I didn't
realize was there can be a little kink in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take it and just slide the
three millimeter line out a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see it's just kind of stuck
together and you can just pinch it lightly
[SPEAKER_00]: with your fingers and it'll come undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water will start flowing and then
you can dial it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have people that will call us with
exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying, hey, I connected to my
water source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened up the carrot fully, meaning with
a little brown cap, you basically turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: counterclockwise so you open it up fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, water definitely should
be coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my basic steps, which it's kind of
funny, sometimes people don't realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: the shutoff valve near their reservoir
they had it closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing is make sure that that's open
so water is flowing throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is people don't realize in
a gravity system that it actually has the
[SPEAKER_01]: water reservoir, the water container has
to be above the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it happen where someone had it at
the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They opened it up and no water was coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, raise the reservoir
another foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they did, water started flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of what you talked about,
which just rarely happens with the eight
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeter, but I know with our super flex
tubing, which is just a highly flexible
[SPEAKER_01]: tubing compared to the eight millimeter
black, that can sometimes kink in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: if it gets stuck together, it basically,
it's kind of like something's stepping on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you just want to kind of pinch
it the opposite way so it opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the three millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that happen more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still pretty rare, but sometimes that can
get stuck to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of what you said, you just need
to pop it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as long as you see as long as you
open up your carrots and see water is
[SPEAKER_01]: going out, is flowing out and at a
consistent rate because sometimes you get
[SPEAKER_01]: air bubbles in your line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to kind of purge those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you see just a regular flow of
water coming out, then you're good to go
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're ready to proceed with setting
it up and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just attached our carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have water flowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've dialed in that blue mat now so that
we have a hanging drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the opportunity to attach up
to five distribution drippers or the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: soap hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an adapter for that blue soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say blue soap, what we're
talking about is essentially a soaker hose
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this paper and plastic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you would describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely feel like it's a little
more plastic element.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially there's plenty of drip
tapes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you call it either soaker hose
or drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two words for it,
which essentially is a type of tape that
[SPEAKER_01]: has these holes throughout the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows you to essentially
distribute more water using a soaker hose
[SPEAKER_01]: than just individual drip points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference is distribution drippers
are essentially just one spot where water
[SPEAKER_01]: can drip out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the great thing with attaching those
to a carrot is you can just have one
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor, so one area where water is being
sensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have multiple drip points off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that allows you to even get up to a 10
gallon pot, like a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to have even just one sensor
with multiple distribution drippers so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can really water the entire
surface of that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our soaker hose, like what you
said, we call blue soap, blue soap drip
[SPEAKER_01]: tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can attach to the carrot or what
has been just happening for 25 years over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a farm in Cuba using the
same drip tape that they've been using for
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years, which is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't even have it attached to
the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead it just comes off of a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just waters a certain amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a big difference between our
soaker hose and conventional soaker hose
[SPEAKER_01]: or drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is other drip tapes tend to
only water every seven inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, or even every 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: While ours is the entire thing actually
has thousands of micro tiny holes
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole thing dispenses water,
not just certain parts of the drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is our tape is reusable compared
to a lot of other drip tapes that people
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to actually throw them out every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a huge waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible for the environment because
a lot of times these farmers are just
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the tape into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just tilling over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: While ours you just bury it under the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can leave it out during winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can reuse it for years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we have a farm in Cuba
that's been using the same one for 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with Puerto Rico and Brazil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very kind of a famed drip tape in our
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we managed to do, which Austria
and Germany, all the other blue mat kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of mega countries, what we managed to
achieve is we've combined blue mat carrots
[SPEAKER_01]: to this blue soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can basically water a lot larger
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 100, 150 gallon pots are bigger with
that using only one or two sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing with just large row crops
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've managed to get greenhouses
using blue mat sensors just attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: this soaker hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just lay it out to the crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one sensor or the two sensors you
can attach one to the beginning or another
[SPEAKER_01]: to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows you to just water these much
longer rows of crops using one sensor that
[SPEAKER_01]: will still turn off and on based off the
moisture around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what you're kind of talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, actually I'm going to be posting
a video of the setup in my greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're currently in the middle of right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an 84 by 30 foot greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will post some photos and more
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost me about a thousand
dollars, I think all said and done to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate, set up the blue mats throughout
the entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm going to get that back in
the cost of labor and watering throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I'll have it for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's well worth using in these
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to worry about my staff
remembering to water the plants too so
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't get too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually changed the design again
since the last time we talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we tried a few different ones out,
but when I went to actually set it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized I think I have a better way of
doing it for my particular situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll send you some photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one we designed like a month
ago or something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally we were going to have two
carrots, one on either side of the row,
[SPEAKER_00]: running drip tape opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've changed it to where I have one sensor
now right in the middle of the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've run sort of a giant circle
or swirl around that bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still getting irrigation on both
sides of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to answer or tackle some of
the questions that we had gotten after our
[SPEAKER_00]: first podcast with Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the listener concerns was about
water sitting in the line too long or
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing portions of the soil to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to comment on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you mean by water sitting in
the actual line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about within the eight
millimeter, three millimeter tubing or in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soaker hose?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume they mean either with the idea
being that the water wasn't dripping out
[SPEAKER_00]: at a fast enough rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somehow that water was being
exposed to temperatures or leaching from
[SPEAKER_00]: the materials being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing with a blue mat system is the
water is continuously flowing or running.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why with our pump systems,
we have the pump is pretty much always on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with a garden hose or like a hose bib
system that you're always leaving that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to really set a timer with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the gravity system is obviously
the exact same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is always flowing through the
gravity system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one of the questions we were
getting, and this might be it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that within the actual supply line,
people were wondering if they could run a
[SPEAKER_01]: timer so that the blue mat was only on
half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question was with air being within
the actual line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are two kind of separate issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of water being in line,
you want water always in both eight
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeter tubing and going into the three
millimeter tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same with the pump systems is
people are always asking if they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: always be on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is basically yes,
because you could theoretically turn it at
[SPEAKER_01]: a timer so that it turns off the water
flowing at night when you're not using it
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main concern is you want to make
sure that the blue mat always has some
[SPEAKER_01]: water within it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for some reason at nighttime,
if the soil did dry out and too much water
[SPEAKER_01]: left the blue mat, then you'd have to
refill the blue mats with water,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is obviously a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have hundreds of plants on
blue mats, you'd have to kind of fill each
[SPEAKER_01]: one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the main reason why a blue mat
system is on 24-7 is because it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be feeding and not feeding and
sensing when water is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you turn off the water supply going
to the blue mats, it might be fine for an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour or even longer, however long it might
take for the plant to take in the water or
[SPEAKER_01]: for the soil to just get more dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you overdo it, then you're going to
have to probably refill the blue mat with
[SPEAKER_01]: water to get it to be responsive again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to kind of jump in on that one
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought was maybe that the
temperature in the line might get hot on a
[SPEAKER_00]: sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know you can bury the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm actually doing is I'm going
through and I have a larger black,
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker hose that I just picked up at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm running my eight millimeter
inside of that hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time I have a connector,
I just cut the larger hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not one straight line through,
but there'll be these gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I can bury that thicker hose
while protecting my eight millimeter line
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have customers walking through
my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a UPEG greenhouse all the time and
bumping things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by burying all of that, I can keep it
protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also maintains the temperature in the
line so that if it is a hot sunny day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that black line isn't just sitting out
there baking in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and I think that brings up another
really great point is just in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in a blue mat system really,
where a blue mat kind of you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this was a question we were getting a
lot, is people already had drip systems in
[SPEAKER_01]: place or they already had some plumbing in
place and they're asking if they could
[SPEAKER_01]: still use a blue mat system and integrate
it within that system or if they would
[SPEAKER_01]: have to buy all the new supply tubing and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes, you can definitely
fit a blue mat system into almost any
[SPEAKER_01]: other type of system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually what it needs, the difference what
you need is to either add a pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: reducer so that you reduce the pressure
down to 15 psi, which is pretty low
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, but that's what a blue mat
system works ideally on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, almost every single system that I
design on a daily basis is different
[SPEAKER_01]: because people might already have a
quarter inch regular drip system in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the really cool and easy thing you can
do is we have all these sorts of fittings
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have made here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: actually where it allows you to go from
that quarter inch conventional drip tubing
[SPEAKER_01]: to our three millimeter blue mat drip
tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with half inch people might,
for larger systems with thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, people might have a half inch or
even full inch PVC kind of plumbing going
[SPEAKER_01]: around the entire facility or room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty easy for us to,
we have a bunch of fittings that go from
[SPEAKER_01]: either three quarter inch or half inch
that you can kind of allow to have main
[SPEAKER_01]: header lines where there's a bigger water
source and then have it feed off into
[SPEAKER_01]: individual pots or beds going into a blue
mat system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, and I think that's what
you're kind of saying before, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a larger header line and then
you're going to be able to go into a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller conventional drip tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the other questions I received
was, can you add nutrients to the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the best way to fertigate plants
when you're using blue mats?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you send through?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can't you send through in terms of
like nutrients, enzymes, surfactants,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's something people ask a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of depends, honestly,
when it comes down to it at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of people that do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we have a nutrient guide that we
tend to send to people whenever they ask
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole nutrient guide was just us
browsing through blogs, asking our
[SPEAKER_01]: customers and friends and just testing
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found kind of a list of yes
nutrients and no nutrients that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I generally tell people is if the
nutrient is pretty water soluble,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you pretty much are good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning, and by that I mean if it mixes
well with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as it's a nutrient isn't
changing the consistency really harshly,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if it's really thick in nature or
really sludgy, then you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to, that would have a chance to
clog the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because anything that's really thick,
in any drip system which uses really small
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny holes to drip, to emit the drips,
then you're going to actually end up
[SPEAKER_01]: having issues where it's going to clog the
line and it's going to be kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the nutrient is pretty water
soluble, meaning it mixes well with water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not very thick, then people have
a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that list we have just a ton of
green ones, everything from Protract to H
[SPEAKER_01]: &G and Micro Bloom, Maxi Bloom,
Bloom-Bastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list just goes on with what people
have had success with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often what people have said is that using
this solution called Drip Clean is a go-to
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it kind of gets rid of all
the crystallization that can go on within
[SPEAKER_01]: the bloom mat and it just clears the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something people also might encounter,
and I've seen this on Instagram and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: is sometimes algae or this type of
basically organic solution just starts
[SPEAKER_01]: growing within.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's algae and what you kind of
want to do with that, biofilm is the other
[SPEAKER_01]: way I just remembered, usually what you
want to do with the biofilm or algae or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that is we run a little bit
of hydrogen peroxide solution to just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of wipe that out and kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing you can do with
nutrients is just there's some solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can do to kind of take care of
the line and just keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally I love to just keep it simple
and I don't really run nutrients inside my
[SPEAKER_01]: drip line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less hassle in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I do is a nutrient well,
meaning I kind of just dig a little hole
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil and add my nutrient kind of
outside of the drip system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a nutrient well does is
essentially it allows the nutrient to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly into your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're away for a few days,
that's a good solution with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, just hand feeding is always a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do want to run nutrients through,
which I know a lot of people do,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There just might be some future
maintenance you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is we do have Dosatron
systems that work with larger scale blue
[SPEAKER_01]: mat systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need help designing those or if
you have questions, then you can always
[SPEAKER_01]: ask us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer is yes, you can run
nutrients in a blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you might have to end up doing a
little maintenance to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: clog the line or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll just share that my opinion on it
is my preference is not, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, not to run any nutrients or
other additives through that system
[SPEAKER_00]: besides water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the reasons you mentioned,
plus the dangers of biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real easy, I think, to just take,
especially with organics, if we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want to add say seaweed extract
powder, I can mix that with water and just
[SPEAKER_00]: water it in over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't send those through either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to remember three
millimeters is not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty small hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of stuff can clog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moving on, do you want to talk a
little bit about how people are using them
[SPEAKER_00]: with a pump and when that might come into
play for some growers in certain setups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially a pump system is just
another way of saying it's just a pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pumps really come into play when
people don't have either the room size to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a gravity system, because either the
ceiling isn't high enough or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that they just don't have a hose bib
within the facility either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the alternative to getting a pump
is just getting a pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you connect that to a regular spigot
or hose bib or even garden hose itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people use a pump system generally in a
facility that doesn't already have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when they essentially want to pump out
of a barrel of water, a reservoir,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't want to raise the reservoir high
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of cases, people have nutrients
in that barrel in their 50 gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they want to pump that nutrient
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another way of using a pump
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use your own pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is you have to connect a
blue mat pressure reducer to it and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to 15 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I'm saying the blue mat
pressure reducer is because you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a hard time going to a regular
hardware store and finding a pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: reducer that goes into 8 millimeter line
while our pressure reducers do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason is we have tested out other
pressure reducers in our systems and found
[SPEAKER_01]: that they actually don't really reduce the
pressure to that actual rate that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, they just would restrict the
flow, but the pressure would still be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely recommend getting a
blue mat pressure reducer than trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of cheap out and get one that isn't
actually going to be reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why you would want to use a pump is
usually when you have more than about 50
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and you just need to get enough
pressure to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying with the pumps though,
the other reasoning you want to get from
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of our pump kits is that everything
is included from the pressure tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our pumps we use have a built-in pressure
switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you would need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have all the fittings and
components that kind of attach it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that the pumps we use are
rated for continuous use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you try using other pumps that
aren't rated for continuous use or don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have this pressure switch, you tend to run
the risk of burning them out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just out another couple hundred
dollars and you might want to still just
[SPEAKER_01]: end up buying the pressure pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question, yeah,
the reasoning to use a pressure pump is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually for larger scale grows and also in
cases where you can't get a gravity system
[SPEAKER_01]: high enough or you don't have a built-in
hose spigot or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, pump systems are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the last question I had was one of
the other methods for irrigation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really popular in this community in terms
of low tech solutions is sub-irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: planters or SIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel blue mats compare with
SIPs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with what I'm describing
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen on YouTube and I don't know
these kind of click bait articles that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually end up being really cool how to
kind of create your own automated watering
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost kind of works similar to a
blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is you're kind of over
feeding water for a bit and a consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have blue mat bottle adapters that
literally do the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You connect it to a two liter Coke bottle
and it just feeds a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: water per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the idea, honestly,
it's kind of really cool the engineering
[SPEAKER_01]: behind these where essentially it's the
same property that a blue mat works off
[SPEAKER_01]: where the soil is kind of acting as a
semi-permeable membrane where water is
[SPEAKER_01]: being let in and out consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is with those systems,
as I mentioned, you're just watering at a
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent kind of rate basically just to
keep the soil wet while a blue mat kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: monitors when it needs to be watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a really just this great
article that was written on Marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: Venture essentially and they wrote it on
blue mats eventually because there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: this huge this hidden killer that people
don't really know about which is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially over watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tends to happen a lot of times
when people hand feed as well because then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll just use a bucket and throw water
on top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the plant is doing when it gets
over watered at first, it's essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: like being too full.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat too much, you're not going to
really want to eat more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happening with the plant is
when that's happening, it can't even use
[SPEAKER_01]: the water that's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because basically at a deep down
biological level, the stomata is
[SPEAKER_01]: overfilled, meaning it can't use the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone knows how kind of
photosynthesis and everything works where
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant is using that sunlight plus the
water to create sugars within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you overwater, those sugars
aren't being created.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a kind of a delay with those
sugars being created because the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: so full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant isn't growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to see that the plant
isn't enjoying it either because the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves still stay green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't turn dry or anything like they
do when you underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant isn't growing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of at this hibernated
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the hidden killer with over
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what some of these systems
where you're basically just feeding from
[SPEAKER_01]: below and keeping it saturated all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of run the risk of that happening
where the plant isn't going to die,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the same time, it isn't going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say for higher valued plants,
a blue mat system is pretty ideal for that
[SPEAKER_01]: exact reason where it's not going to
overwater at one point, but it is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: water it throughout the plant growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when a plant needs more water,
the blue mat accounts for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it waters more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drips more water into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's smaller, it's using less
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to overdo it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the main difference is
those systems work great for plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't really care about how they grow
or how big they get or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a system where you do want to get a
plant to yield as much as it can and to
[SPEAKER_01]: really grow at its best rate, then in that
case, a blue mat system is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: better alternative versus these other
automated systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to say I do like the idea of
sub irrigated planters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they work pretty well with
established plants because it is a wicking
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the soil dries out, more of that
water will be pulled up into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: column from below.
[SPEAKER_00]: My issue with them is that when you first
transplant the plant into that system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still going to need the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a challenge sometimes with
blue mats, too, in that that area right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere there around the roots may
not be getting enough water, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: that pot is still heavy and has a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those cases, you're still top
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically with cannabis,
I found it seems to me that, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal, that top down watering seems to
be more effective overall, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always chosen that over sub irrigated
planters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a new grower, I know a lot of
people will use sips or earth boxes as an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative as a way of watering when
you're not as familiar with proper
[SPEAKER_00]: watering or have a system like blue mats
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at the end of the day,
we just want to also get water to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm fully supportive of sub
irrigating planters or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as long as you don't forget to
water your plant, your plant's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we kind of want.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, our goal is to just
have happy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever works for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Damien, I want to say thanks for
taking the time today to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've sent me this new tips
and tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Article, which I can post up on the
podcast page for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have further questions,
they can contact me or Damien directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put all your information up there on
the podcast page and perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm happy to do these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying, I love listening to
your podcast as well myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a huge pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know one thing I've been seeing and
people have been telling me on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot is now they're choosing your
podcast as a kind of a default method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or podcast to hear when they're commuting
to work or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking I might just do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have something exciting coming up
with Nelson Linsley here in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: along the podcast line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep you guys posted, but I don't
want to give too much away on that just
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, Damien.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be signing off on this podcast,
but look forward to chatting with you
[SPEAKER_00]: again here in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
