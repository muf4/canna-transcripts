[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before starting this week's podcast,
I have a couple of quick announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 44 at the time of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an amazing journey and I've met
some incredible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal was to really create a platform
to help bridge the gap between cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I've done all of this for free,
putting in hundreds of hours with the goal
[SPEAKER_00]: of sharing this information and also
helping people find out about me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, due to work demands and financial
constraints, I'm reaching out now for two
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to keep the podcast going for
free, I'm adding a Patreon page and also
[SPEAKER_00]: some short ads in the podcast themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon page allows listeners to
donate at a monthly tier level starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: only $1, with other tiers offering a
monthly private Google Hangout group and
[SPEAKER_00]: even the ability to co-host an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've learned something from this
podcast and want to support it,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to www.patreon.com backslash KIS
organics to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to be adding short
sponsorships or advertisements to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast itself to help cover the time and
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be really selective though
about what companies I work with and will
[SPEAKER_00]: only have products and services that I
would use in my own personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for understanding and support of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to this week's interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Eleanor Koontz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleanor is a trained herbalist and
geneticist, bridging the gap between
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional herbalism and modern science.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is co-founder of Candor, the People's
Herbarium, the first herbarium committed
[SPEAKER_00]: to documenting and preserving cannabis
cultivars and varietals, along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: collective knowledge gained through
community engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read more about Eleanor's
extensive educational and experiential
[SPEAKER_00]: background on the podcast page,
as it's more than I can share in this
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to get her on the show to
talk about the importance of herbariums
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they relate to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Eleanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Todd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start off giving listeners a little
bit of a background into sort of your life
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you came to have this role with
Candor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My life has been a walk through a lot of
different jobs in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off as a florist in high school
and I've kind of been chasing various
[SPEAKER_02]: realms of the plant world since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did my undergraduate degrees in biology
at Smith College and then went on really
[SPEAKER_02]: to do some work, fundamental work on
systematics through a really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: internship at Kew Gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sort of set the stage for my
interest in plant taxonomy and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiversity and how that biodiversity is
spread across the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, I did a lot of kind of odd
jobs and things, but then found myself
[SPEAKER_02]: back in graduate school focusing on plant
genetics, in particular plant population
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, really looking at how
populations of plants are influenced by
[SPEAKER_02]: movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So invasive species biology and how our
cultivated plants in particular are
[SPEAKER_02]: affected by movement of weedy sister
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bachelor's in biology with a
focus in botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have a PhD, it looks
like, too, in you said genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have my PhD in genetics and my
focus has always been on plant systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to this, you also
apparently graduated from the Sage
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain School of Herbal Studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a background in herbology,
too, is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I went back to graduate school,
I was unsure of exactly the direction I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took a wonderful little detour into
the herbal world in a very focused and
[SPEAKER_02]: pointed way, studying to become a trained
herbalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really deepened my connection to the
plants through that particular educational
[SPEAKER_02]: experience there on Sage Mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just knowing myself and looking at my
self, I realized that my love of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and the herbalism world really came from
the perspective of the plant, whereas I
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyed the power the plants have to heal
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: My particular interest wasn't in helping
sick people, but was in helping those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants which help us become well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I really started to focus on the
health of the ecosystems and the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were sourcing for our herbal
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this fascinating background
and education level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, it sounds like you founded
this company called Candor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Candor is a nonprofit that we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am mostly spending my day to
day running a company called Leafworks,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a botanical identification
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really focus on identifying plants
for the natural products world for
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance and fidelity not only in
packaging and labeling, but also in supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain security.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you really buying the plants you
think you're buying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we sort of came to the
party about five years ago when we were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a lot of identification and realized
that with a lot of our friends and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: my deep family members that had been
working in cannabis for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the tools and reference materials
that you would need to really make good
[SPEAKER_02]: science happen and to make good
identifications happen weren't available
[SPEAKER_02]: for many, many reasons which we can go
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how we came to the necessity
to found Candor really as a landing place
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand the diversity and types that
we have within the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly is a herbarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: So an herbarium is a repository.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a location and a place that holds
collections of preserved plant specimens
[SPEAKER_02]: and then associated data that are linked
to those plant specimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're used for multiple purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most primary purpose is when you find
a new species or develop a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: An herbarium is the repository by which
you would press a sample of that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: describe that plant, and then that would
be used as the reference sample to then
[SPEAKER_02]: move forward with any kind of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you discover a new species of
flower, you're going to make a species
[SPEAKER_02]: description and that species description
is going to be linked to at least one
[SPEAKER_02]: preserved plant specimen and herbarium
pressing of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are then looking at how that
plant is distributed across space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you're looking at dandelion
and it's all across Europe in addition to
[SPEAKER_02]: North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at how dandelion differs from
place to place based on voucher specimens
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been taken in different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's kind of two levels of utility
for an herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most primary is defining type and sort
of getting everyone on the same page.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we say gala apple, everyone knows
what a gala apple is and how it's
[SPEAKER_02]: different from something like a Granny
Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making that name have meaning in a
biological sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on that second level,
we can then see, OK, if we grow gala
[SPEAKER_02]: apples in 17 different kinds of
environments, how do those environments
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the apple itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that kind of you kind of answered
my next question, which was sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: how do when we talk about different chemo
type expressions of the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cannabis is shown to be able to
express itself quite differently across
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're what you're doing,
then, if I understand correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: is sort of giving us a context for that
conversation by giving us a starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that first level, just making
definitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have individuals that have
been stewarding plants and have been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and have been caretaking
particular clones for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And individuals who've worked with
specific plants really have an idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the essence of that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the chemistry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the structure?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the production qualities?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kinds of environments does it excel
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this knowledge, and so it's really
a repository by which we can link that
[SPEAKER_02]: information to a physical representation
of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we know that if we move that
thing from place to place, it does the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry is going to change in a lot of
ways, like a lot of the flower color
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know a lot of different kinds of
cultivars or cannabis types that will
[SPEAKER_02]: express these beautiful purples and pinks
if they're exposed to cold temperatures,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they won't if you grow them indoors in
a more even and mild climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So monitoring how those particular taxa or
those genets vary across the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herbarium itself is that physical
repository so that we can really catalog
[SPEAKER_02]: how that is occurring and really
understand that G by E or that genetic by
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental interaction that gives us
that really rich and very sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated phenotype that we see with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the legal implications for a
grower in terms of preserving genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm somewhat familiar with what the OCP or
open cannabis project is attempting to do
[SPEAKER_00]: on their end with intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, how does an herbarium fit into
this whole landscape?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, an herbarium is actually the most
fundamental and basic way in which we do
[SPEAKER_02]: this with plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we were describing roses and
zinnias and peonies and all of the rich
[SPEAKER_02]: history we have with all of these these
flowers, I mean, we weren't using anything
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond an herbarium and physical
descriptions of these plants to really
[SPEAKER_02]: dictate type or dictate, you know,
what is a Queen Anne rose?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a, you know, lady slipper?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a pink tea rose?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of these different kinds of
roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the herbarium acts as this very
fundamental basic step by which a breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: can define their material, make a physical
representation of that material,
[SPEAKER_02]: like an actual tangible object that is
then linked to a description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, chemistry or genetics or any
other kind of information can be layered
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of that voucher specimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the voucher is actually the physical
unit that grounds that information in
[SPEAKER_02]: reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that that physical
representation does, much like in other
[SPEAKER_02]: arenas with legality, it offers a point of
prior art such that you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: reference back to type and see if it is or
is not a unique object.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're talking about legal forms,
one of the things you really need are a
[SPEAKER_02]: arenas in which you have information
about, you know, prior art, what is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community, what already exists so that you
can move forward with patenting or refute
[SPEAKER_02]: patenting based on uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a breeder perspective,
by getting their plant classified with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone like your company, with an
herbarium, they're essentially preserving,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're preserving their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allowing them potentially a way to
defend or refute a patent on that final
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that essentially what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually a much more powerful way
than using genetics because, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: with genetics, with all of the genetic
services that are out there, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving you a panel of snips or a very
short and small window into the genome in
[SPEAKER_02]: which you're working, which is not an
accurate representation of the entirety of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant itself is the most complete
picture of what you're trying to preserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that becomes the reference point on
which all of this additional information
[SPEAKER_02]: can be layered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you imagine you have a
hundred thousand base pairs and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: only looking at a hundred of them,
it's a very small window into what that
[SPEAKER_02]: genome is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be deceptive in uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the herbarium itself, you know,
grounds that in reality with an object
[SPEAKER_02]: that is tangible and real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what an herbarium does is it
gives you sort of a historical context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm thinking of Linnaeus when you say
herbarium, sort of this taxonomy process
[SPEAKER_00]: of identifying, really dating back
historically quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be sort of the foundation
then for which intellectual property or
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics could then come into play around
a particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's an interesting thing when
we talk about cultivar because in plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a very difficult concept to even wrap
my own head around, but genetics does not
[SPEAKER_02]: define cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually a very inappropriate way
to define cultivar because we have many
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars that have disparate genetic
backgrounds that are considered the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so banana is a really good example of
this, where the ladyfinger banana that we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, you know, in many different
locations across the globe and is what
[SPEAKER_02]: services our banana intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the bananas we buy at the grocery
store is this cultivar banana,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the majority.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that particular banana is a cross
between two different kinds of banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of genetic diversity in
mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter, you know,
which individual from those populations
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using, it's the cross itself that
makes banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the genetics behind that cross are
exceptionally variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the situation where different
genetic backgrounds produce the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the converse example,
where I know most of us have witnessed
[SPEAKER_02]: this, where we have a rose or some kind of
plant in our garden, where all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: a single sector of that plant will look
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will either have mottled leaves or a
red rose will all of a sudden turn into a
[SPEAKER_02]: rose that has white stripes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be located on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you take a cutting of that sector
that is different, you know, it's the same
[SPEAKER_02]: genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost the most identical you can
possibly get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can clone that differential sector
and call it a new cultivar, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's different than the parent,
even though the genetics are 99.9%.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so genetics itself is not the most
reliable way to define cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar is this entire picture of a
plant, not just its genetic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I understand you correctly,
you're saying that a different genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of essentially the same
genotype with maybe just one small
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation would create a whole new
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your second example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just trying to wrap my brain around
all of this, because you're throwing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of information out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that being said, essentially what
you're saying is that a cultivar is not
[SPEAKER_00]: its genetic makeup in whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's much more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cultivar is driven by human
selection and human definition,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why the mission of the herbarium
is so much found in the mission of
[SPEAKER_02]: candors, really founded in taking the
knowledge from the community to define the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars that they've been stewarding
because they know those plants better than
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And genetics alone are not the units that
define what those cultivars are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the context of cannabis,
I'm sure we can all think of certain
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are going to be clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's only one harlequin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want harlequin, you have to
have a cutting of that plant to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there are other plants where,
you know, it's a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a certain cross that happens over and
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the exact genetic background of that
cross isn't what's important, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: who's the mom and who's the dad and how
that cross plays out within that seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock becomes the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis is this, it's this
beautiful mess of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetics right now, I feel like,
and we don't have any idea really what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we, I think we're in desperate
need of some classifications in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, because even, even the known
genetics that are out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are constantly breeding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting new expressions of those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing genetics all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like this would just,
would be a way to, to take sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: snapshot of one particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you calling them cultivars then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the best nomenclature when talking
about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm a plant biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I default to that because for me,
that is what you call a plant type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call them cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the, the community itself
really likes the word strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's a microbiological organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a hard time calling a plant
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're all talking about the
same thing, those units that hold together
[SPEAKER_02]: as you know, an essence of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we say chem dog,
we know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we see harlequin, we know what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and the diversity that is
surrounded in that name, I think really is
[SPEAKER_02]: the community's job to come to that
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you explain to me how CANDOR might
help the cannabis community sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: document this biodiversity that they're
holding onto?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're, we're really pushing
with our breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allies and our breeder friends who've been
doing a bulk of, you know, bulk of the
[SPEAKER_02]: work to really generate new types and then
also distribute those types to
[SPEAKER_02]: differential farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so where those, those units are
being developed is our first entry into
[SPEAKER_02]: definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so working with them to define their
plants, make vouchers, and then really
[SPEAKER_02]: follow those types through the community
and different growing arenas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you can track not only the sort
of gold standard of what that cultivar is,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then how growing it amongst different
farmers affects the type and the herbarium
[SPEAKER_02]: itself becomes the resource by which we
can sort of hold that information as a
[SPEAKER_02]: community and learn where those boundaries
are and how, you know, we do get this
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity when we grow things in different
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the herbarium itself is exactly,
as you put it, the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: That holds that information so that we can
do not only good science, but also have
[SPEAKER_02]: names and titles that make sense and are
grounded in the history of what's happened
[SPEAKER_02]: with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you take me through the process of
how a grower would, would work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with CANDOR, with this herbarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we visit farms and right now we're
visiting a lot of mother rooms and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking cultivar intake would include
taking a vegetative cutting of about 10 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 inches of the plant and then physically
pressing that vegetative cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done in this very special cotton
paper that's going to preserve that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned Linnaeus earlier and he's
actually the human that did the type
[SPEAKER_02]: specimen for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pressing, we actually have up on
our Instagram and we'll probably repost it
[SPEAKER_02]: in a bit because it's a beautiful example
of an herbarium pressing, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a vegetative pressing and then
we'll also take a early flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, you can't, once they're big
glorious colas, you know, it's pretty hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to get them into a two dimensional form,
but you know, that early flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see flower color, internodal
spacing, any of the important
[SPEAKER_02]: morphological characteristics that would
really define the type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll make a pressing of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have individuals or certain breeders
that we're working on, like some colas are
[SPEAKER_02]: very active participant in the herbarium
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And working with candor, a lot of his
seeds are mother, you know, specific
[SPEAKER_02]: mothers crosses specific fathers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in that case, we'll take pressing
herbarium vouchers of both the mother and
[SPEAKER_02]: the father, and then a panel of the F1s
that are consistently produced from that
[SPEAKER_02]: cross as the definition of type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whenever we can, we also include
that pedigree history to just preserve the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire lineage of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a deeper understanding of where
that plant comes from and how that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: holds together as a unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once those pressings are made,
the breeder themselves will fill out some
[SPEAKER_02]: informational forms about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sort of basic stuff,
their flower color, spacing, structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all those characteristics about
that plant that define who that individual
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some authorship in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned Subcool, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be his name on that page
associated with that particular flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have certain individuals,
you know, that are stewarding plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, you know, maybe the original breeder
has since passed, or maybe it's been held
[SPEAKER_02]: in community so long, it's really hard to
tag who is the quote owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have, you know, these are plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very typical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We carry our plants with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's almost an odd thing to assign
ownership to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with those individuals that have a
more historical presence in the community,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you basically are doing are authoring
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you might not be saying this is my
plant, but you're saying I have stewarded
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant since 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I got this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the history of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who, you know, so you can
corroborate types.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can type in that way too in a
historical framework where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever is donating that voucher is
assigned, you know, is signing their name
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're donating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, that doesn't have to
be the original breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be someone who's really just worked
to steward the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the cost associated with
something like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now we are all user input.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is no initial upfront cost to
donate vouchers to the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herbarium itself is a resource that is
open to anyone who wants to contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the work is done by that individual to
make that contribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we facilitate that work at the
herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no auxiliary cost right now and
structuring sort of data basing and things
[SPEAKER_02]: to make the information more accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will probably be a membership fee,
but that will come once we have a platform
[SPEAKER_02]: to really share that with so we can,
you know, open it up to the community to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a little more access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's really about amassing that
fundamental information from that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, voucher, that like breeder level
to really have a running start to get the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the resource to a point where it
has a lot of utility for the greater
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now you're in the stage of
collecting samples, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the end goal of the herbarium
then once you have sort of amassed this
[SPEAKER_00]: huge library of genetics in this form?
[SPEAKER_02]: The end goal is really to have a resource
by which that we can have cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: convention and have, you know,
select panels of people who've been
[SPEAKER_02]: working with these plants or who are the
original breeders really come to the table
[SPEAKER_02]: and make cultivar convention such that we
can move the community itself can move
[SPEAKER_02]: their own naming system forward and really
be in control of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like, you know, the Westminster Abbey
dog show does for dogs or canines where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's judgment about who's best in show,
who's best in each class of dog breeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the same thing that we're
trying to grow the structure around so
[SPEAKER_02]: that the community can do the same kind of
work where we have, you know, our
[SPEAKER_02]: different breeds or our different
cultivars in units such that everyone has
[SPEAKER_02]: some basic agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, getting everyone to agree is always
a challenge, but getting to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: where we at least have classes of,
you know, what are hazes, what are our
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush types, what are, you know,
all of these different groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that resource itself can be the
functional tool to solve maybe disputes or
[SPEAKER_02]: to really come to terms with what is
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's much easier to have an
argument or move discussion forward when
[SPEAKER_02]: you have something to point to,
something to reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the herbarium wants to act as that
to move the conversation forward in a
[SPEAKER_02]: productive way based on real things as
opposed to hearsay and story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's use that as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, if you had say 500 or a
thousand samples of various hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could then take an unknown cultivar or
unknown sample and compare it to that and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, this is a haze ancestry most
likely based on these morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics like inner node spacing or
leaf shape or growth habit or that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the more historical haze
successions that you have or vouchers that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have that link back to particular
breeders and particular collectives,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can go on and do exactly what you
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take an unknown and then compare it to
really figure out how does it fit into
[SPEAKER_02]: that context, you know, into that
framework?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a member of that group or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I see this as being really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something that would be
wonderful to look at in a museum,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially getting to see all of these
different samples throughout various
[SPEAKER_00]: generations and just how many different
ways this plant has been bred and
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't feel like I have a complete
grasp, though, of how this relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders in relation to intellectual
property, because I know that's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: concern right now in terms of preserving
genetics, either from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_00]: profiting off those genetics or from the
perspective of sharing those genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what the OCP is attempting to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that relate because it's still a
little confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the OCP is really focusing on
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem with data is that data
ownership is not truly linked to the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual that generates the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, any one of us can go to a
dispensary and buy any number of plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: the form of flower and sequence them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not mean that any of us own
those plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like if I went to the grocery
store and bought a gala apple and I
[SPEAKER_02]: sequenced gala apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't mean I own gala apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the amount of sequence data in the
general that's deposited on GenBank or
[SPEAKER_02]: NCBI through the Open Cannabis Project or
whatever gives information to individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: about the diversity of cannabis that's out
there, but it does nothing to link
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics to tangible plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reference point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I, just to take a step back,
as a scientist, if I'm going to go and
[SPEAKER_02]: study acanacea, the first thing I'm going
to do, if I want to make some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: assessments about the genetics of
acanaceas, I'm going to go to an herbarium
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a bunch of different acanacea
vouchers from the eight most prevalent
[SPEAKER_02]: species of acanacea that are in my area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to use those tangible
voucher specimens as my reference point
[SPEAKER_02]: for the science I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's missing is the tangible
reference point that links abstract data,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is genetic ACPG kind of data to a
real living organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, you know, there's a lot of
different ways to encourage genetic or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, IP, but having the genetic data
linked to a real plant is a fundamental
[SPEAKER_02]: importance to generate IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because without the ownership of the
plant, like genetic data is just genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can generate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still trying to wrap my brain around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little confusing in my head no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, if I understand you
correctly, what you're saying is there
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be a link between what we're
getting from a lab analysis and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual physical plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to figure out is if I'm
a breeder and I want to preserve these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics from, let's say purely a
financial perspective, let's say I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: profit off of these genetics because I've
created a plant that has these
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics or this particular
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does, I guess, how does the OCP fit in
and then how does candor fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's sort of the differences there and
what's the importance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, candor is going to be the location
where you would physically define that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and then make your physical
pressings of that plant to define type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from that point on, any
definition that, you know, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual breeder who's making that
accession is going to keep copies of those
[SPEAKER_02]: vouchers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I make it, let's say you have made
you know, purple cherry drop number two,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's your new plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make a voucher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep one as the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be held in posterity as a
reference point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're also going to keep that
voucher for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as these vouchers build up,
it becomes a resource to the patent
[SPEAKER_02]: office.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they are looking for definitions
of type to see is this a unique and I am
[SPEAKER_02]: not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the intricacies of plant patenting
is exceptionally difficult and it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to patent the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally to patent a plant, you have to
genetically modify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get a varietal patent,
so that's the difference between a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar and a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: A variety is just a flavor of cultivar
that has a legal framework around it like
[SPEAKER_02]: gala or Arctic apple would be a
genetically modified variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's actually very difficult to
patent a plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you wanted to define that cultivar,
the physical representation is your first
[SPEAKER_02]: step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're going to do any kind of
genetic or chemistry, you would layer that
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of that physical voucher as the
definitive of that voucher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can have two very different
plants that if you're just looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry can come up the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean that those plants are
the same just because the handful of 10
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals you're looking at in a pantheon
of 500 chemicals happens to be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the OCP is really from my understanding
really amassing data such that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: more information in the academic community
to really get at diversity and those types
[SPEAKER_02]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll have to get Beth on the show
here to sort of explain a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the OCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't I won't expect you to explain
about another program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've mentioned apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just I would say let's stick with
that example, maybe with a honey crisp
[SPEAKER_00]: apple, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I created honey crisp, I would then
go to an apple or barium and give them get
[SPEAKER_00]: a pressing or a voucher of that honey
crisp apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, would I also go and
get the genetics done on an apple?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, would I own that
particular IP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's not really IP at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you do is you would really so
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the peony society has a really good
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can Google peony society and they have
new varietal submission or new cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: submission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what you do is you would
describe that apple, you would describe
[SPEAKER_02]: why it is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the unique attributes of that
apple?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe sugar content,
it might be time to flower, it might be
[SPEAKER_02]: height of the tree, you know, if it's not
a grafted apple, which most of them are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it might be, of course,
flavor profile, color of the skin,
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf life, time, time to ripening,
all of these characteristics would be
[SPEAKER_02]: included in that definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your consortium or your group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for peonies, it's a peony society.
[SPEAKER_02]: For apples, I'm sure they have their own
society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would make a judgment,
is this a unique thing that deserves a
[SPEAKER_02]: title in and of itself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it deserve to be a named thing that
is unique and different from the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivars that we have in that apple,
you know, in that apple group?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's deemed to be unique,
then it would have its own name assigned
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those definitions would then be
attached to that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no need to do genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics has never in the history of
cultivars been a defining, like the way
[SPEAKER_02]: you define something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, genetics is really modern and
cultivars, a concept of cultivars is
[SPEAKER_02]: really old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a, we're in an interesting
place in time where we are using modern
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies for things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of overkill in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just, I mean, I'm a geneticist,
not to poo poo genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics are amazing and powerful and we
can learn all kinds of things from
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, but they aren't the primary tool
to do this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they never have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from an ownership or property
perspective, they're, an herbarium makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say, yeah, it makes a lot more sense,
especially as a first pass, because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very basic and it is very,
very attainable for anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no big cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no special equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no relying on anyone else's
analysis or data panel, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: marker set.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very, very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to voucher it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then any of those other technologies
that you may feel are beneficial to
[SPEAKER_02]: additionally describe your material,
just add, you know, it's just like icing
[SPEAKER_02]: on that cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just adds to your definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're the foundation and then having
other things like the genetic makeup and
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even it's maybe even it's chemo type
expression would be more assertions to
[SPEAKER_00]: support your ownership of this unique
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when genetics, I mean, most of the
time, like to get ownership of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: material, you actually have to physically
change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to change the genetics of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of our breeders aren't doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not using modern genetic techniques
in most of our classic community breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that there's also like a
little bit of false hope that genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: gives to people of surrounding ownership
that isn't completely based in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just thinking this through,
what's to prevent someone from bringing a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar to you that maybe they did not
breed themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it originally was a haze or a
blueberry or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then claiming authorship of it because
they were the first ones to get it into
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever accepted herbarium becomes,
you know, conventional standard for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That question kind of persists over any of
these ownership modalities or is it the
[SPEAKER_02]: first to file?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the first to sequence?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all of these issues are very much
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of the herbarium is because it
is a community run resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those accessions, those inputs are vetted
against the panel and the entire group of
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look like haze, for example,
or chem dog maybe is a better example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have someone who's
submitting something and they're calling
[SPEAKER_02]: it by a certain name and we are comparing
it to another thing with the same name,
[SPEAKER_02]: you then look to history and the community
knowledge of that plant to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: decision about which type is actually
accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am very much not the person to make
that decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I don't think anyone in the
genetics community, I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: their job to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really is the community itself
coming together and arguing or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to come to consensus about where these
plants come from and what plants are what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nice thing about the herbarium is
those accessions remain and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to them and have dialogue about
what is real and what is not based on
[SPEAKER_02]: tangible pieces of evidence and tangible
units.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see it being much like the American
Kennel Club model, where you have a group
[SPEAKER_02]: of individuals that have been breeding
dogs for a long time and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: consensus about what is a terrier type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to come to them at the
AKC and say, I've bred a new breed of dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have that entire group that you have
to then interact with and justify why this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular group of crosses in your dogs
justifies becoming a new breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the same thing in the plant
world, if you have someone coming and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying this is the original haze and it
just doesn't match up with the other ten
[SPEAKER_02]: accessions of haze, then you start looking
at your, you know, we have partners that
[SPEAKER_02]: do the historical aspect, like the 420
archive is a partner for us or a
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborator, where then the historical
context and the stories and the history of
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants come in to really help parse
out what's real and what's not real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's no straightforward answer
to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really liked I really liked that
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I thought you really captured
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the dog breeding example
really sort of solidified in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you're describing there with
a new breed or a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like everyone who has a plant
that they think is special or that has
[SPEAKER_00]: unique origins, they really should be
reaching out to you to contact you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I want to I want to give you the I
have you give out that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do, I didn't want to forget
one question I had is you keep mentioning
[SPEAKER_00]: the word voucher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what a
voucher exactly entails?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a voucher is like the gold standard
of the type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I've made a new a new cultivar,
that voucher is the collection of both the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative pressing and the early
flowering pressing in concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within any of that additional information
that goes along to describe that flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: that entire packet or that entire unit
would be considered the voucher of that
[SPEAKER_02]: haze or of that Ken dog or, you know,
of that cherry pie number 10, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the voucher is just that gold standard
saying that once we've come to a
[SPEAKER_02]: consensus, this is the plant that we're
you know, the name and the plant have
[SPEAKER_02]: become solidified.
[SPEAKER_02]: That voucher is the sort of gold standard
by which we can compare other things to it
[SPEAKER_02]: to see are they or are they not that
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're keeping the physical you're
taking one sample pressing that and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the physical sample that stays with the
herbarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I assume you're creating a sort
of a replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm picturing like a color piece of paper,
like a color printed version of this that
[SPEAKER_00]: then would be considered the voucher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the voucher is actually the physical
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those are digitized and they're
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The physical pressings of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you weren't in love with cannabis
already, this will make you just love them
[SPEAKER_02]: even more because, you know, they're art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that physical pressing that
becomes digitized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the voucher of haze would then be
that gold standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's say that I'm growing in an
indoor grow in Southern California and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing outdoors and humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could then each donate to the herbarium
field accession.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a version of this plant grown in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying I'm the original breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying I know I'm growing this
plant and I'm growing it in this
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add to the panel of
information that really surrounds that G
[SPEAKER_02]: by E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do those plants interact with
their environment to have that flexible
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype that we see so often in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that would be the field level,
the field accession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of those also become
digitized to become a resource for the
[SPEAKER_02]: community that is contributing to the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone wanted to get a voucher of
ChemDog, for example, from the herbarium
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, that would be a digital
copy that they would be receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a physical thing that you have to
keep this tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you would do is you, the voucher
itself lives in the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have reason to need to vet your
material, then you would use the voucher
[SPEAKER_02]: as the reference point, but you wouldn't
actually get the voucher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be using it as your reference point,
much like you would for in the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, if I'm going to the Smithsonian
looking for those acanacea vouchers,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want to do a project looking at
spatial differentiation in acanacea across
[SPEAKER_02]: the prairie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to physically give me
those samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may give me what I need, whether it's
a reference point to go back to,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if I'm doing chemistry, they can give
me some chemistry profiling, or if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, they can give me some genetic
profiling so that I can make sure that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at what I think I'm looking at
based on that voucher that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the voucher itself lives in the
herbarium and is digitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this data, once you have
collected a sufficient amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this something that's going to be
published online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is going to be publicly available down
the road?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it will not be publicly available at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 100% for the community itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are a contributing member of the
herbarium, you have access to the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources of the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for us to sell to any other
outside group.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point here is to really make
definitions for and about and by the
[SPEAKER_02]: community such that they can own their
material and they can leverage the
[SPEAKER_02]: information that they're collectively
gathering through the repository of the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if I donate material,
would I have access then specifically to
[SPEAKER_00]: just my material, or would I have access
to other material in the herbarium that
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to my donation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so if you are giving a voucher of a
particular type, then you have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: the voucher set, like all of the vouchers
that are in the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a farmer in Mendo and you're
growing in that area and you are
[SPEAKER_02]: contributing field accessions,
like these are the plants I'm growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you these accessions in
my field, then you have access to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino herbarium to really understand
how those plants are expressing themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: within your area so that you can utilize
the resource that you are contributing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this really is a community
resource in a sense, even though it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a public resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to clarify that because if people
are giving you essentially these genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: or this data, just finding out sort of
what the long-term goals for that data is
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mission of your nonprofit I think
is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the mission is really to help the
community define their own cultivars so
[SPEAKER_02]: that they have the power to not only
maintain access to those cultivars but own
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants and the names and the history
of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other, all of our partnerships that
would surround chemistry partnerships or
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic partnerships would really be only
done in alignment of defining cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: types so that those individuals donating
those types have ownership of those types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no, the herbarium is not set up
to do any, we don't have the financial
[SPEAKER_02]: prowess to genotype all these things or
chemically analyze all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those bits of information would
come from the breeders and the cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves submitting that information to
support the cultivar definitions that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're defining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're saying is
you're not giving up any ownership of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant by sharing this and creating a
voucher but what you are doing is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to the richness and history of this
plant and preserving essentially doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite, essentially preserving your
property or the work that you've done in
[SPEAKER_00]: this greater semi-public forum or
collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and you're actually increasing your
legitimacy of ownership because you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: third party herbarium that's holding the
material that actually defines your type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's actually a very effective way
to create precedent and ownership
[SPEAKER_02]: precedent that is linked to you as the
owner of that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anything, it actually contributes to
the lineage of ownership by contributing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it sets a stake in the sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had this plant and this is
the plant and this is how it's defined and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the passing of that ownership is not
anything but solidified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's only solidified for that
individual by making a contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this sounds wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like something everyone should
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people do this though if they're
not located near you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we deal with state lines
and other challenges like that around
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the herbarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is real grassroots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've actually got herbariums scattered
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a herbarium in New England.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have many across the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some talks with people who are
willing to house herbariums up in Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: and Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the state line issue will become
hopefully knock on wood, less of a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: as we march forward into sanity with our
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as it is now, the vouchering process
is happening everywhere and local
[SPEAKER_02]: herbariums are working to house that
material so that the entirety of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community can really reach in and dig into
this resource and utilize it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're running around to a lot
of different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having press parties and different
things where people can come together and
[SPEAKER_02]: start vouching their plants in a very
social environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of farm meetings set up and
we're touring around, in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California and the Northwest at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really contacting us and
figuring out when we'll be in your area
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we can connect because state lines
are really fake in the trade of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So giving everyone access as much as we
possibly can right now is a huge priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to post links and information
on the podcast page, but can you go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and just tell people where to find you and
how, if I'm a grower, how I could go about
[SPEAKER_00]: getting my plants into the herbarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our website is candor.org, C-A-N-N-D-O-R
.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our Instagram handle is just
candorherbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And either way, Instagram is a really
great way to get a hold of us and renounce
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of our travels and where we're going
to be via Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of those media outlets are quick
and easy ways to get a hold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for your time today and for
explaining a little more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a wonderful program,
what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you wanted to share
with podcast listeners before signing off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been so fun to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a lovely space to be able to
talk about science and the fun kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cool aspects of what's going on in the
scientific community and how it intersects
[SPEAKER_02]: with all this wonderful history and just
love of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for taking the time to listen to
what we're doing and motivating us to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue on with the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the end of this podcast is a little
different than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: After signing off, I continued to chat
with Eleanor and learn more about candor
[SPEAKER_00]: and herbariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought what she shared off air was
valuable and really solidified my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm including it as bonus material at
the end of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm interested to see how much it's
so hard to get momentum around anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I'm thinking about
certifications, like trying to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic certification for cannabis has
been such a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of see this falling into the
same category there of just if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough people around to create enough
momentum to hit that tipping point,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it could be it could really be this
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it's not amazing already,
but no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The snowball needs to get bigger to roll
down by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's it's just been such a
lovely time in this last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really been connecting with a lot of
those, you know, the breeders that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really selling a lot of the proper tools
in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a really good entry point in
doing that, because those are the places
[SPEAKER_02]: where farmers are getting the material if
they're not generating their own material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a really good layer to start
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from that, you get a lot of the
more hometown home home cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: material starting to come and people
starting to get interested in realizing,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, what I have is unique and different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we had this Renaissance in
the Victorian era with breeding of roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not much different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really just harnessing the love
of that plant as a community and then
[SPEAKER_02]: moving that forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think potentially we're setting
ourselves up, though, down the road for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least maybe not so much me, but maybe with
you with like a big legal fight with two
[SPEAKER_00]: growers or even corporations getting
involved just because this industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth so much money?
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't podcast stuff, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's almost like unless you're unless
you're genetically modifying a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost impossible to get a plant
patent because you can't patent life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most of us agree with that
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't want to patent plants
in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but we have plants like,
for example, so I have an edible nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a plant that came on the market a
few years ago called Raspberry Shortcake,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Monrovia was the one selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of this Brazzelberry series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this thornless container
raspberry that sell fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not allowed to propagate that
plant legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in theory, I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But legally, you're not allowed to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own the rights to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's a varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a varietal patent on that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because the thornless trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great example of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same plant as the next door
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got a mutation in it and no longer
produces thorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everywhere else in the genome,
it's probably exactly the same as the
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because of that, because it's
unique and different enough, you can get a
[SPEAKER_02]: varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a varietal patent is a lot like a what
is it like a pharmaceutical patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only for a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't say that I can't grow that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says I can't sell propagules.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could, in theory, propagate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't make money off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because it has a varietal
patent associated with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot like all of the you
know, there's a really great example of
[SPEAKER_02]: like blushing beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potentia in Swedish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it in English?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like base hydrangeas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blushing beauty hydrangea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how much acid you put on
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hydrangeas turn blue if they're
in acidic soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, there's something wrong with the
gene that makes it blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter how acidic your soil
is, that hydrangea will always be pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have a varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called blushing beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Lowe's has an exclusive right to
sell the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that is I think they're 15
year patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 15 year protections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like on the plant, it's a varietal
patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the name associated with the type
associated with the ability to sell the
[SPEAKER_02]: propagule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we end up with seed stock then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you're saying, but I'm
wondering, too, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every year I go out and buy Sakura red
tomatoes or whatever variety of tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's making royalty on that who
created that original.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they have a varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's like kind of a semantic
thing, but it's not because a patent on a
[SPEAKER_02]: like you can get a patent on a plant such
that no one can do anything with that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant if it's a GMO plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's a variety like either
naturally occurring or based on selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: that patent, that like burpee and all of
the seeds in like silver queen corn and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why they have a varietal
patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have a varietal patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only buy the seeds from them,
but those only are certain breadth of time
[SPEAKER_02]: for which those varietal patents are
valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, they're kind of like
in the in the genetic germplasm of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community and you can't have ownership
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also doesn't mean that I can't
breed with that thing and change it and
[SPEAKER_02]: make it different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means I can't sell that particular
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but if I took it and bred it with
another tomato, the original person
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have ownership over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just want kids like when I was at
the Emerald Cup this year, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge line for one particular breeder seeds
and he was making a killing on selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I was it got me wondering,
like if he has a plant that's considered
[SPEAKER_00]: so valuable to this community that they're
willing to wait in line for five hours
[SPEAKER_00]: just for the seeds, because it's the
latest and the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other value does that plant have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is he giving up by selling his
seeds or essentially sharing these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what got me thinking
about all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, and then there's the Coke
model, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you don't ever give up that recipe
or you never give that clone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it in-house and you only sell the
products because you don't have and you
[SPEAKER_02]: held it as a trade secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the way to hold IP more
tightly than any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not to let it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard to get traction because
you've got to be able to make a market and
[SPEAKER_02]: support and apply the market without
letting it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plants are just weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like plant IP, like, my God,
please have a plant patent attorney on
[SPEAKER_02]: your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the person to really ask
because it is not easy or straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are different rules whether you
are genetically modifying a plant as to
[SPEAKER_02]: what you can do as compared to if you're
just doing like normal selections from
[SPEAKER_02]: populations of naturally occurring plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that basically what's
going to happen is all of these legal
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances won't come out until it actually
becomes a case, like an actual case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to see what the law
really is around this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is definitely going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that having resources like the
open cannabis project, which is like data
[SPEAKER_02]: dumping and herbarium, where you have
physical repositories of plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: defined, well, then all of a sudden
they're important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to really come up when the
PTO has to say, oh, we didn't look at all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the all of the prior art that's out
there, nor do we understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing that I get told
repeatedly with patent lawyers who are in
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with us about how can we
utilize the herbarium in our patent
[SPEAKER_02]: searches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know where the resources
are to know how to analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a bad situation to be in when
the patent examiners don't even know where
[SPEAKER_02]: to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: To know how to approach the patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because nothing exists currently on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole, because it's a whole new
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't just use the framework from
other agricultural crops or industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem is the frameworks for
other industries, they look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: herbarium, look at the society that is in
charge of definitions and we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and so you're trying to create that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the community itself should be in
charge right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be all these genetic
companies that are saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're defining groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, but you're defining.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're defining groups based on going to
the dog pound and sequencing every dog in
[SPEAKER_02]: the pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, that's making an
assumption that all the dogs in the pound
[SPEAKER_02]: are purebred and you're making types based
on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninety nine percent of those dogs are
mutts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're kind of confounding the
issue by doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually making a lot of false
data, which is not helpful to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with enough samples and enough
vouchers, we'll have the community will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a concept for what the actual genetic
lines look like and what what you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially what a purebred plant or or
dog would look like in your example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we have arguments about it,
you have reference material to go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually answer questions based on data
as opposed to hand raising and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, non data.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes so much more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a question about haze all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say, OK, these are a thousand haze
examples that we have out of these
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand, these hundred come from fetid
sources or these hundred are corroborated
[SPEAKER_02]: based on more than one one line of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can, you know, you can hear
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can structure questions to answer them
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that without a resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't you can't do good science
without tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just another tool to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Eleanor Coutts, co-founder of
CANDOR, the People's Herbarium.
