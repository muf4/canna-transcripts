[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'd like to talk about soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now soil testing is very important so we
know what sort of fertility exists in our
[SPEAKER_00]: bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure we could go with a generalized
fertilizer recommendation or guess based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what our plants look like and what sort
of symptoms or deficiencies they're
[SPEAKER_00]: displaying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we really want to dial in our
fertility and know exactly what levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates, phosphorus, potassium,
calcium, magnesium, all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: are in our soil then we have to do a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also tell us pH, the EC of our
soil, and a bunch of really useful metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: for dialing in our soil for our next cycle
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so the very first step would be to go
onto the website at kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to click on the amend tab and
then go down there until you see the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that page we have a list of options
of various types of tests that we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these tests are through Logan Labs
and the price on our website is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the exact same price as through Logan
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can order through us it does
help support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we offer everything from the complete
soil test with an analysis all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through to checking your irrigation water
for suitability, tissue testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then finally a standalone analysis if
you have a soil test from another lab or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a Logan test that you got
independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do charge a little bit more for the
analysis if you don't order the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing through us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you plan on doing both then the best
option is this very first complete soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll just add it to your cart go
ahead and check out as you would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what will happen next is you'll
receive an email from us typically the
[SPEAKER_00]: same day or the next business day at the
latest and it'll come from orders at
[SPEAKER_00]: kisorganics.com so be sure to check your
spam folder and on that you'll see it
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get an attachment that will already
be filled out you'll just put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample ID in this case we use garden one
and then we also have the instructions as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as how to fill out the submission
worksheet and how to take the sample that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll receive digitally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what tools you need
for a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will need a plastic ziplock bag
that you can write on and tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need gloves because the moisture
from your fingers can impart sodium and
[SPEAKER_00]: other minerals that can affect the results
of your soil test and you'll want either a
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel trowel or your hand just
you can use your hand if it's potting soil
[SPEAKER_00]: like this which is my preference or a soil
probe if you want to get one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like $20 or you can make one out
of PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I just switched to an empty bed
because I thought it would be easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: this demonstration I've got my gloves on
and I grabbed a clean bowl that I can mix
[SPEAKER_00]: the samples in so I'm just reaching down
with my hand I'm pulling out a handful at
[SPEAKER_00]: about a six inch depth I'm gonna do that
from multiple places in the bed so I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: more homogeneous sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can sample multiple garden beds at
the same time that's definitely an option
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just mix all the samples together
and get a rough idea of where your soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: in your garden overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to send in multiple
samples you absolutely can too that's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely an option but if you're trying
to save money in a lot of cases you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just mix them together and the samples
will be close enough or give you a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea of where your fertility is in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to mix the soil even
more thoroughly together just to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fully homogenized you can do this
regardless of the size of your sample or
[SPEAKER_00]: how many samples you take you just want to
make sure to mix it thoroughly prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into the ziplock bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put a generous amount into the
ziplock bag the lab says they want at
[SPEAKER_00]: least two cups I always put in extra it
doesn't hurt anything to include a little
[SPEAKER_00]: extra in your sample and that will
guarantee they end to have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if they have to rerun a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next you want to label the soil sample to
make sure it matches exactly what's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: submission sheet this is especially
important if you have multiple samples so
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no issues of things getting
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final step is just to tape up
the soil sample making sure to add extra
[SPEAKER_00]: tape right along the ziplock seal as well
as taping the bag to itself just to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that nothing spills out during the
shipping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the best way to ship these soil
samples if you're just shipping one sample
[SPEAKER_00]: is to use a USPS priority flat rate
envelope or padded envelope and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have multiple samples then you could
move up to like a medium flat rate box
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're really close to their
location this tends to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable way to ship these products and
don't forget to include your submission
[SPEAKER_00]: sheet along with the soil sample in the in
the envelope or in the box and you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the lab receives your test they
will reach out to us with the test results
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same day that we get the results
we will send them on to you if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis as part of your package that
you're ordered through Kiss Organics we
[SPEAKER_00]: will also send you that comprehensive
analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a sample of an email that you would
get from us they typically come from
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon and they include some resources on
our website that you can check out as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as some additional notes just a high level
stuff of what we saw on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The test themselves this is the standard
test this would be the Malik 3 extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to tell us everything that's
in the soil from an acid extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and then in conjunction for
the complete test we also have the
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saturated paste report tells us
exactly what's available to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and so between these two metrics
we're able to make really good actionable
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions about how to re-amend our garden
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have your analysis you
can go back to the soil report analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: page on our website where we list a bunch
of helpful information like cups to pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: here's an example of what a analysis will
look like though it'll be customized and
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommendations will be made for you
either in pounds or cups as to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to amend your soil specifically with
along with all this information and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is freely available on our website even if
you don't use us for soil testing you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still check this out as a potential
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to mention we have
what we're calling the usual suspects and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the things that we typically
like to use in our recommendations and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can also go on our website and click on
like target phosphorus target calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever amendment you're looking for and
find the same sort of recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: there in terms of products that you can
use in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all there is to it so
please reach out if you have any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and we look forward to working with you
you can check this all out on our website
[SPEAKER_00]: at kisorganics.com or reach us through our
contact page you can give us a call or
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot us an email thank you very much.
Thank you.
