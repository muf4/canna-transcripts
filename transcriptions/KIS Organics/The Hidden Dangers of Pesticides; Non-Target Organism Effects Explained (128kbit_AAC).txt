[SPEAKER_00]: Hi guys, so something I wanted to talk
about today was non-target organism
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I always think about
when I'm deciding what product to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden and what I may be spraying or
applying to my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, when I sprayed these
plants, when they were in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed them with Monterey Horticultural
Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also known as Sufoil-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oil-based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of oil-based options out
there and they work primarily as a
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means the insect can't develop a
resistance to it, it's just being
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, other products that may be applied to
the soil to treat fungus gnats or some
[SPEAKER_00]: other issue like that could potentially
have non-target organism effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning you may be killing the fungus
gnats, but you're probably also destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: other biology, especially things that are
biofumigants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, that could damage
your nutrient cycling or perhaps make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or the soil more susceptible to
pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the great thing about beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we apply beneficial insects,
pests can't develop a resistance to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being eaten by the predatory
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all things you want to think about,
always keep in mind non-target organism
[SPEAKER_00]: effects when you're picking out some sort
of application that you want to make in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thanks for checking in.
