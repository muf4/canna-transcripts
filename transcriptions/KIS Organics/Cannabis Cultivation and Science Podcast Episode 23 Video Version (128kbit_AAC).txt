[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're enjoying these podcasts,
please take a moment to subscribe to our
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter on our homepage to stay up to
date on the latest podcasts, product
[SPEAKER_00]: announcements, and videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to make a lot more videos this
year to highlight some of my favorite new
[SPEAKER_00]: products, soil test kits, and very various
projects around the farm that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: would be helpful to gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this week's podcast was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my podcasts can get more technical
or science-focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for this podcast, I want to talk
directly with a grower to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: hands-on experience and knowledge from
someone in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the honor of sitting down with my
good friend, Nate Gibbs, owner of Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf Gardens, a tier two producer here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast was my first attempt at a
video podcast, so if you're listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast and would like to see the
video version, you can go to YouTube dot
[SPEAKER_00]: com or the podcast page to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the video version,
I will also have some extra content to
[SPEAKER_00]: support some of the ideas we discussed,
as well as more footage of Origins,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary next door to where we shot
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to see more of what Gold
Leaf is doing, you can check out their
[SPEAKER_00]: website at www.goldleafgardens.com or on
Instagram at at goldleafgardens420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this podcast was a little bit
trickier to record because we shot the
[SPEAKER_00]: video in a coffee shop, so it's a little
bit echoey, but I did my best to edit the
[SPEAKER_00]: audio and make it the best we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I apologize in advance for the quality
of the audio in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that being said, Nate was a great
guest and I had a really fun time sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: down with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy the content of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here today with Nate Gibbs doing our
very first live video podcast here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're opening a new coffee shop right
behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not open yet, but it'll be opening
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a recreational cannabis shop
next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new way of sharing and showing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take you guys over there with the
camera afterwards at the end of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're watching on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Nate here is a tier two cannabis
cultivator here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows organically and is someone that I
met quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're known for with Goldleaf
Gardens is having the highest quality top
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf cannabis here in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some samples here,
which I'll zoom in a little bit of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Nate, can you talk a little bit about
your history and tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you got into growing cannabis
originally?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're grateful for where it's come to now,
just to be in a place like this out here
[SPEAKER_03]: in public with amazing, beautiful stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our products displayed on the shelves and
on TV screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to have the sort of environment
to be able to showcase the work that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing at Goldleaf Gardens and Polar Ice
Tracks and Lyric Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long, unimaginable way away from
the dingy five foot high basements that we
[SPEAKER_03]: were starting off in a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about when we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I met you, it was working in
collaboration on a potential project that
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend of ours was looking to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you at the time had a 100 light
facility on the medical side that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you talk a little bit about
that process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to skip over a lot of
details, but kind of starting from just
[SPEAKER_03]: the early grassroots cooperative patient
to patient care provider model here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: One person growing for a couple of
patients in their basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, you know, sort of moved from there
into, you know, opening our own dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: where we worked with a collective of
growers and a larger collective of
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually that we outgrew our home grow
operations and moved into our first
[SPEAKER_03]: warehouse, which, like you said,
is about 100 light warehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a that was a big step.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the time, you know,
Washington state laws were still a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were taking a sort of progressive
interpretation of the laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, at that point, you know,
nobody knew, you know, day in,
[SPEAKER_03]: day out, if you were going to get shut
down and have everything seized or if you
[SPEAKER_03]: were positioning yourself to become part
of this burgeoning, you know, legal
[SPEAKER_03]: markets that was beginning to become,
you know, legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we met at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were we were looking at how we were
going to transition from this the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: days, the medical model into the
recreational model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and everybody was ambitious and the
future was, you know, very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and there's a lot of big money going
around to finance very large, ambitious
[SPEAKER_03]: projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were I think we were working on
something that, you know, was ten times as
[SPEAKER_03]: big as we ended up landing it with now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best thing that happened from that
was really meeting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were beginning to come into our own as
organic growers, you know, sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: following that path from just,
you know, figuring it out on our own to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, starting to realize that was the
direction that produced the best products
[SPEAKER_03]: and was most in line with our values.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we didn't really know what we were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit more about how you
learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm you know, back then there wasn't
a lot of information available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your what was your source of
information?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, there was not a lot of
information and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, at the time we were,
you know, nervous about even logging on to
[SPEAKER_03]: computers to search for info.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it all felt that illicit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I'd go to the used bookstores
and get these old tattered copies of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Ed Rosenthal book, How to Grow
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And
[SPEAKER_03]: we, you know, there's a small network of
people that, you know, we would we would
[SPEAKER_03]: share ideas about what worked or what
didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then there was, you know,
the the local hydroponics store,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was sort of this, you know,
hub of where growers would go and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cross pollinate ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, ironically,
you couldn't tell anybody what you were
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, but everybody knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sort of had this little dance you
had to play.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I remember I would I was so,
you know, I would I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would I literally if there was
a new product on the shelf that offered to
[SPEAKER_03]: boost my yields or boost my my flavors or
or fix my mites or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we I think I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was about the time I ran to keep
it simple, which was sort of the exact
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite philosophy I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was keeping it complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, it's funny because we had
completely different upbringings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ways that we ended up around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I had no experience with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with my parents owning a nursery
landscaping business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was around plants, you know,
my entire life, but never cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I had never been to a
hydroshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I walked into a hydroshop,
I was like, what are all these products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was really intimidating for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never seen, you know, fertilizer was
like a bag with a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no three numbers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and three numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no like a hot chick in a bikini
or these fake monster plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen the word bud so much
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I I was my my dad's and my mom sold
their nursery and leased the land out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the company they sold it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did that, my dad decided he
wanted to start a compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was like way back in like nineteen
ninety nine when that whole industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: just starting out with Dr. Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had this this compost tea
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going and we I came back from
Australia and started helping him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd get these phone calls from guys
to be like, yeah, I got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 tomato plants in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a little it took me a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like, oh, these guys
really like their pasta sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured out what they were actually
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started Googling compost tea and
found some forums online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with the forums, you know,
you're right, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of that, it did feel a little
elicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What direction the industry was heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I'd been working and
learning about soils and just getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis myself and started working with
Jaya Palmer, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to testing out different soil
recipes and seeing how we could grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants more organically and without all of
these other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jaya was really instrumental in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was a lot of fun
getting to learn about an entirely new
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and learning how to grow indoors is
totally different than growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and the higher value of the crop sort
of allows you to to really experiment with
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs that just don't make sense if
you're if you're actually growing tomatoes
[SPEAKER_03]: or you're growing, you know, cabbage or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it kind of opens up the
whole other realm of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, if we can absorb these these input
costs, you know, you know, how do we
[SPEAKER_03]: really maximize this plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a 10 percent yield in a cannabis
harvest, you know, thousands of could be
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so I think that's part of what
drives that the cannabis nutrient market
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, trying to always sell you
more and more, some of which works and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, which does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we originally were working on the
soils that I thought was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting was the goal initially was not
a commercial application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to create a product where a cancer
patient or a medical patient could walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into a hydroshop and rather than getting
hit with all of these bottles and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: lines in this craziness, they could just
take a bag of soil and walk out the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and water their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jaya was able to start figuring
out some of these commercial applications
[SPEAKER_00]: on scale, which is sort of when we met you
and you were doing some of our first
[SPEAKER_00]: trials to with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there was a learning curve
there and like some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't work quite as well as you wanted
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, I mean, we were skeptical just
because, you know, it was such a different
[SPEAKER_03]: thought process than what we had been sort
of accustomed to in terms of buying a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of bottles of, you know, off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a I think you, you know,
you remember we had a really complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you had this, this piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember five milliliters of this and
three milliliters of this on the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the eighth day algorithm,
you know, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the craziest nutrients I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plants look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you guys were really good
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, you know, what was
happening because it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're, we're successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the time, you know,
and you know, you couldn't tell me that I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't growing the best cannabis then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which I wasn't, but the, the,
the, uh, you know, we had so many things
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would talk to all these people
and they'd say, Oh, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the secret ingredient is,
you know, roots accelerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: The secret ingredient is this bud booster
or this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would, you know, my logic was,
well, if I take everybody's secret
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients and it's just going to have to
be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, and, and so you end up coming up
with like, you know, pretty good results,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because we weren't very scientific
about it, we couldn't tell you what it was
[SPEAKER_03]: that was leading to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was just more things we're
buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I was spending a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a very complicated recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a lot of redundancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, as you taught me, there's a lot
of bottles of things I was greatly
[SPEAKER_03]: overpaying for because you know,
it might've been a now, now I look back,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, you know, guano suspended in water,
but it's, you know, $50 a bottle instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, the dry inputs you could buy
for dollars of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think five of the bottles you had,
had the same seaweed product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's talk a little bit about,
uh, that transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did some trials with living soils
and then decided to commit your new
[SPEAKER_00]: facility to that method of growing with
the goal of reusing the soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle after cycle with minimal amending,
amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what your
facility looks like now and how you set it
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I remember when I was, you know,
kind of modeling out the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the new facility, which was, you know,
more than twice as large, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just taking our nutrient costs and putting
it on paper, taking the way we were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: things, you know, ended up being very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was starting to have to think about,
you know, the scalability of our
[SPEAKER_03]: processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it was really opportune,
you know, when I met you and Jaya and you
[SPEAKER_03]: said, you know, here's this, you know,
here's this, uh, way of growing plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is going to require, um,
you know, which is going to let the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: dictate what they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of as much, you know,
uh, you know, as much of the, the growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, manipulation of the,
of the, you know, nutrient systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then that would allow us to,
you know, tend to thousands of plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we're, you know,
in a short period of time, in a few years,
[SPEAKER_03]: we went from, you know, a few dozen in our
basement to, you know, we have four or
[SPEAKER_03]: 5,000 in our garden anytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can't do the same
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't give each plant the same type of
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I think that's, that was,
you know, you know, we're, we're the light
[SPEAKER_03]: bulbs started to go off, but also as we
were going through these trials with sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of that as the end goal, you know,
we, we realized we were growing some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best product better than we had been,
you know, and your yield wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily any larger at that time,
was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't think it was,
you know, significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was significantly larger, but it
wasn't, it wasn't worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say the quality was, was better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also too, you know, we just found the
overall health of our gardens began to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of just tack in a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of, you know, being very hands on
with the nutrient regiment also meant
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really hands on with our,
sort of our, our IPM program.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're, we're using a lot of,
we're spraying a lot of things and
[SPEAKER_03]: treating the soils and treating things
above the ground and, and running to a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of problems, you know, we'd have,
you know, have a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and once we sort of, you know,
really let the, you know, built a good
[SPEAKER_03]: living soil environment, the plants became
happier and I think their natural
[SPEAKER_03]: immunities began to become fully
actualized and we just found ourselves
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting a lot less problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot of emails about a blog post
I put up with actually a photo from your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility on reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use, you got, you got a bunch of
plastic pallets in, like blue plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets, which is great because they're a
lot easier to clean and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to harbor disease like a
wood pallet would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had a custom built fabric
pot, I believe made specifically for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets with the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're on racks, so they're
raised up so you're not bending over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about like what,
cause you, how many rooms, how you have
[SPEAKER_00]: them set up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we have, so our soil beds,
you know, which might be kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: modified version of, you know,
what, you know, you and Jay have kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: designed, they're, they sit on food grade
pallets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, we had a geo pot
design us a, a fabric bed that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that fits exactly on that palette.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, part of the great thing about
pallets for anybody designing a large
[SPEAKER_03]: facility is there, you know, a lot of
material handling options.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, warehouses, house pallets,
racking, forklifts, everything sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: knows how to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not recreating the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not recreating the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of use that as our standard,
you know, unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, we have a, a soil bed
with, with, with, you know, kiss soil that
[SPEAKER_03]: we re-amend each round.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd never throw it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and each bed will plant six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll have sort of a
independent trellis system per bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll, we'll use a, you know,
sort of a Scrog type of training to,
[SPEAKER_03]: for those same six plants that share that
bed and that trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're, that's just for your
flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're vegging in a separate room in
smaller containers and then transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: into the beds for their final.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so we have one room that's,
you know, one 400 square foot room that's
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated to all of our propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll spend a couple of weeks in there
in smaller plastic pots, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: move into one of our seven production
rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each room has 50 beds and we'll plant six
plants per bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for, you know, so about 300
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and then they'll live the rest
of their life cycle in that room for
[SPEAKER_03]: about, we'll, we'll give it about a week
of transition time in that room,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because they're going under slightly
more intense lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that, that that's a good amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also, when we harvest, we try to
turn that room over and get plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: there within a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for, for reusing soil, you know,
we, we, we had to really figure out how we
[SPEAKER_03]: can thread the needle, harvest our plants,
get our inputs back into the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: transplant in there within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you were first doing that,
we had to play around that a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were trying to put all the
nutrients back in right at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just causing the soil to heat
up from the amount of microbial activities
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you guys sort of figured out was,
okay, we can put some nutrients back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some organic matter, but then we'll
also top dress nutrients throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to, to allow that, to allow you to
get that immediate 24 hour return when you
[SPEAKER_00]: can start planting back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really, you know, you know,
if you have that downtime to let that,
[SPEAKER_03]: those nutrients, you know, heat up and
cook in there, you know, you lose that
[SPEAKER_03]: production time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and, and if we sort of
loaded up the soil all the way and
[SPEAKER_03]: transplant, and we noticed there's a lot
of transplant stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found, you know, we, we,
we re-amend a little lighter and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll use top dressings, you know,
water in a few things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: put some things into the compost tea as we
brew them so that they can be integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: into the plants life cycle throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just doing water,
you're doing other things too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of compost tea, some, some foliar
applications, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: micronutrients and, and some, you know,
like some top dressing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're always experimenting with new
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that I really
like to encourage with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that you and I, you always
tell me too, is you're always trying out
[SPEAKER_00]: new things and seeing how they do with a
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the important aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually see, is this one
change making an improvement or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: making things worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth the amount of time and money
I'm going to spend on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, and you know, one of the nice
things about, you know, growing at scale
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lot more plants, a lot more beds,
everything being uniform, the rooms all
[SPEAKER_03]: being uniform is that it allows you to
dedicate, you know, a small amount of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, your canopy to these experiments
without really impacting your overall
[SPEAKER_03]: production as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're, you know,
when we only had, you know, when I was
[SPEAKER_03]: only growing 15 plants, if I wanted to try
something to, to five plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: enough for a decent sample size and it
didn't work out, you know, it really
[SPEAKER_03]: impacts you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we wanted to try an experiment to
one or two beds, you know, if they maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: don't get quite the returns or the results
we wanted, you know, we're still,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're still able to absorb that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's hopefully leading to
improvement year over year, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the, so one of the challenges
with the style of growing that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with reusing the soil is the fact
that you're not able to fully sterilize
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil or clean the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so insects and diseases are,
I think you're at higher risk for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the criticisms that I
hear from traditional agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture with this style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the ways that you guys deal with that and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've, you know, some of your
experiences?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I want to ask you a question
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, you know, so, I mean,
you know, on an outdoor farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a greenhouse per se, unless they're in
containers, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're also not, you know, removing the
entire field, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this seems to be something in
respects to a, you know, a container type
[SPEAKER_03]: of system indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess, you know, overwintering
outside, we don't have that going on
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, there is definitely that issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that we don't have the,
we don't wipe the slate clean in between
[SPEAKER_03]: rounds where everything's removed and
sterilized and started over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, you do keep your facility
very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're, you know, disinfecting the
room, just not the soil and the beds
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not messy when you go into
Goldleaf, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as, you know, being able
to have soil, you know, it's not like a
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory level hydroponics facility,
like some of them I've been into.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have, we're still trying to
promote a very, you know, an environment
[SPEAKER_03]: that where, you know, life is proliferated
and, and, you know, encouraged,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, on the soil level.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, robust, you know, microbial
environments, you know, around the leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: surfaces as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, sterile is definitely not
our end goal at any point, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: but cleanliness is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with, with, you know, with,
you know, perpetually reusing your soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: it does force you to, you know,
really think about your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sustainability of it over time and,
and your, your modes of, your modes of
[SPEAKER_03]: pest management, you know, you can't,
you know, you can't apply any type of
[SPEAKER_03]: product that's also going to damage the,
the beneficial, you know, microbes and
[SPEAKER_03]: insects in your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we use a lot of beneficial
insects, for example, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a horticultural spray that's meant to
knock, knock out pathogenic insects is
[SPEAKER_03]: also going to kill our good guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to, you know, you know,
what I think, you know, we're ultimately
[SPEAKER_03]: working towards is, is just the,
the right balance of, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: biology in our rooms that, that,
you know, you're, you're never going to
[SPEAKER_03]: eradicate something all the way,
but you're going to, you're going to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: it under, under control to where there's a
good economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and, and when you kind of
have the right pieces in place,
[SPEAKER_03]: you find that, you know, the gardens would
sort of tend to themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do his mother nature, you know,
intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you compare it to outdoors,
so the, the thing about being outdoors in
[SPEAKER_00]: a field is you can still get, you know,
this, these pathogens where they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, overpopulate, they're always
around just like they are in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, people that say they're might
free or I just, I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really, really hard to
achieve and maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you are able to maintain them
at a low enough level through a good IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where they are very manageable and
having those beneficial insects there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is huge in protecting the plant
and having good microbiology in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about outdoors that's so
nice is you have that diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: predators that already are naturalized to
that environment and indoors, you just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the ability for these pests to
really proliferate across a mono crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: an indoor environment is a lot greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about greenhouses or like
horticulture operations, I've gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: see more and more of those over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are running, you know, they may have
a thousand different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties of plants and things
that all have different insects and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they feel like the only solution is to
spray some pretty heavy pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, well, yeah, with the, you know,
with like, for example, our beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: insects, you know, we found, you know,
I think everybody's still trying to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: how to, you know, these worlds converge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cannabis is so, so new,
but, you know, we found that some things
[SPEAKER_03]: that work on, you know, other crops for
that same pest just aren't really taking
[SPEAKER_03]: hold, you know, developing breeding
populations and things in our rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it becomes sort of economically
unviable to keep using them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found other things that just sort of
take root and get established and just
[SPEAKER_03]: become part of the, you know, the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so that's just been a lot
of experimentation, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite insect or do you
like to add to your room that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: share with listeners?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I, the Roe beetles,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're, they're a little
expensive on the front end, but we,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't remember the last time
we reintroduced them, but if you scoop up
[SPEAKER_03]: a handful of our soil, or I mean,
they even crawl, they crawl everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You find them, you know, all over your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have them in the, in the old
compost too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are they coming in from the old
compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, those, you know,
they seem like apex predators as far as,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, bugs go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I think, you know,
definitely if you don't have those
[SPEAKER_03]: established in your organic soil facility,
you know, those, those are, those are good
[SPEAKER_03]: partners to have in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and just being very prophylactic and
proactive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think kind of wheeling it back to those
early days, it was get a problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: look for a solution, try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to a bigger gun until you're pressing
the nuclear option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and now, you know, you have to
be extremely cognizant about not letting a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, you know, flare up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're constantly screening your rooms
and looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Constantly screening your rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one of the hardest
disciplines I think is to, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: spend money on, on IPM for problems you
don't have, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet it's, you know, when you go back
and study all the time, all of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, your notes, you realize you
spend much more once you have a problem
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to fight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and then you, you don't even think
twice about spending the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crop loss or it's been, you know,
hundreds or thousands of dollars on a
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when, when things are going
well, you know, it seems a little hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: say, oh, do I really have to, you know,
be disciplined in order my, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hundreds of dollars of beneficial insects
and keep introducing them in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you realize we haven't had a
problem in six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and so, you know, I need to keep
up with that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that once you're able to get
from a, you know, sort of a knockdown or a
[SPEAKER_03]: combative, you know, cycle into more of a
maintenance cycle, that's when,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it gets, it actually does get
much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so less stressful,
less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got, you got to keep, you got to
keep investing in that part of your
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, if you're going to,
especially if you're going to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, reusing soil, you know,
keeping mother plants that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, never, never clearing out your
mother room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're always going to have,
you know, some, some plant there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's so many aspects to
cultivation besides just growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you and I have
talked about more recently is the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: idea around lean farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have a lot of experience
with lean manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, read this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've sort of embraced that in your
facility a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that
experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I wouldn't, I don't know if I
would, he might be giving me too much
[SPEAKER_03]: credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been, you know, interested in
the subject and, you know, just always
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about, you know, running,
running a production business,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, looking for, for the right
strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, um, I've always, you know,
been very interested in how, how do sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of take these methods at work,
you know, I've given, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Toyota this great advantage over its
rivals and, and apply that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I always had a hard time connecting
the dots, you know, and always kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas made sense on paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when he gave me that book by,
by Ben Hartman, I was like, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, somebody, somebody smarter than
me finally connected the dots and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been, you know, so we've been going
through a process at our place of removing
[SPEAKER_03]: waste, um, you know, and then just really
analyzing, doing a lot of deep reflection
[SPEAKER_03]: on, on every, every step, every touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it add value or does it not?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you sort of take inventory of that,
you know, how many things you do in a day
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't adding value to, you know,
to your customer at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you say, why are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so it's, it's a trans
transformation process that I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be going on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I, you know, I think it's,
it's really the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, especially as this industry becomes
highly competitive, you know, now,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the, the prices of cannabis here
in Washington state and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from what we've seen in other states,
um, you know, are, are falling,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, getting much closer to, you know,
representing their manufacturing costs,
[SPEAKER_03]: not, you know, this sort of, um,
artifact of what they used to cost in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the medical market or on the street
before, um, you know, I mean, we grow some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the, you know, um, highest end cannabis
in this market, but you know, an eighth of
[SPEAKER_03]: our flower doesn't cost much more than
what I was paying for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in college 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be efficient and there's no
room for fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not taking that money home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well that's even worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the customer is paying the same
thing we were 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we get, we get a third of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, it's, you know,
it really, you know, I think if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not, if you're not running a lean
operation, a very smart operation,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, then it is hard to make money right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I think, I think, you know,
that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, yeah, it is a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it at my, on my farm,
you know, getting an employees to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to what they're seeing
around, you know, how we can keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: property cleaner and how we can improve
our processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of what we do is just so time
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we, I know we can do a better
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we haven't even thought of all
the ways we can do a better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not so much an end goal as
it is just a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really, I'm really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's definitely changed the way we run
our farm and my, and our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that it's, you know,
it's a Kaizen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, that improvement, you know,
that 1% improvement, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not, you're never going to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to try to constantly,
you know, carve away at what doesn't need
[SPEAKER_03]: to be there and aim towards this,
this purity of, you know, pure value rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is more of a, you know, something to
aspire to than probably something you ever
[SPEAKER_03]: actually achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, in that pursuit,
you end up becoming, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming better at what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, um, and, and, you know,
one of the, one of the traps I think we've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen like in, you know, probably all
farming and it's starting to apply to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is that, you know, one direction
people take it is to just grow larger and
[SPEAKER_03]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet you'll see large scale operations
that have taken on a ton of debt to get
[SPEAKER_03]: there, not necessarily being more
profitable.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that seems, that seems
interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas that economy of scale,
but I think, you know, these type of lean,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, methods can be applied to a very small
operation or a large operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way you need to, you know,
you need to be very disciplined about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know for me, I've been a lot happier
since we started implementing this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because the mental cost of all of this
waste was just weighing me down,
[SPEAKER_00]: like walking around and seeing project
after project that need to be completed or
[SPEAKER_00]: just mess after mess that we left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it was exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just getting the stuff off the property
was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still, it's a constant battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so changing directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about cultivation so
far, but as you well know, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: one, one aspect of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, you could be the best
grower in the world right now here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state and still be failing just
because, uh, there's so much more to
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a brand and a market share and
interest in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you, I want to talk a little bit
about your, uh, sort of your company
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy and the morals that you guys
stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, can we talk a little bit
about, uh, branding and marketing aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, you know, I mean, it's,
you know, everything's important now and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's all tied together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things are really close for what
you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I think we were a little
bit ahead of the curve in, in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in just realizing that, you know,
cannabis is going to kind of turn from
[SPEAKER_03]: this sort of, you know, anonymous,
you know, anonymous commodity to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, something that was going to look
a lot more like, like products you see on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelves in other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of early on we stuck
our neck out and came up with the name
[SPEAKER_03]: gold leaf and started branding our
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, um, at the time and say the
medical dispensaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you usually go in, it was kind of like a,
like purchasing bulk supplies,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, at, you know, at an old,
um, general store, you know, you have
[SPEAKER_03]: these jars and here's some, some strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't necessarily know who grew them
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we came out kind of with a jar
with our, our logo on it and it said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is gold leaf weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is, you know, for better or
worse, this is, this is where it's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and so we, we kind of rode that
into, you know, into the, um, the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, now of course that's how all
products are sold, but, um, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the, because now in
Washington, for example, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the products need to be sealed and
kept behind a, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: usually behind a glass counter behind the
bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the customers, um, you need to
really develop a trust with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, you know, having strong,
you know, branding and marketing to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of reinforce that those company values is,
um, is essential and you can be an
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have the most coveted strains and
it can just fall flat for you because you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have that piece in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know a lot of growers in
Washington right now are producer
[SPEAKER_00]: processors as they're called here are,
uh, struggling to get into new stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: get their products sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I know you guys can't even keep up
right now with the number of stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want you and want to carry
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is due to customer
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have come to, you know,
signify certain traits with the brand gold
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I want to touch on
that some more, but I think such a big
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that is your, the culture you've
created there, you know, and the community
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you talk a little bit about sort
of, so I know I have a little background
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of unfair, but I know you guys
are for the, it started off like a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of Hawaiian guys coming out of what Kauai,
I think you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I'm from Oahu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our, you know, all of our growers
are from Kauai.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, we, you know, we,
we have a, we have a, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we kind of identify as a Hawaiian
operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously we have, you know,
we have all sorts of folks there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a, you know, we embrace that
spirit of Aloha, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: regardless of where you're born from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, what your ethnicity is,
it's, it's, that's our value at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you know, what,
what, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it, the word has a lot of
different meanings, but it means love,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, um, just from the love of the
plant to the, you know, the love of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, each other, the family you work
with and your community and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing up in, in a, in a, you know,
unique place like Hawaii, you had a real
[SPEAKER_03]: tight communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was a, a social responsibility
and that, that sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: manage how everybody interacted with each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, it just seems to,
you know, it's just how we live our life
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, uh, organic growing kind of
falls in line with that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, you know, that's, that's sort
of how we run our thing, our company
[SPEAKER_03]: internally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, it is struck a chord with,
with people up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it, it sounds really,
it, you know, it sounds cliche,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, there's people want to know
the story behind the brand and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the, yeah, I think it's
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not, you know, it, I think
there's substance to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, people, you know,
you, you have this dollar in your wallet
[SPEAKER_03]: to spend and you can choose how you want
to spend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, there's some folks who,
Hey, give me the most potent weed for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cheapest amount of money I can spend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've, you know, there's nothing wrong
with that, but that's not the customer
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that seems to, you know,
be supporting our business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's other ones who say,
you know, it's a good product,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also too, I just love the way that,
you know, you, you guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: run your business, you know, or are good
responsible members of the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give back, um, you, you grow things
responsibly when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no rule that says you have to,
but you know, we know, we trust,
[SPEAKER_03]: we trust your cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know you take care of your,
your employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and so, you know, at the end of
the day, I mean, that, that adds up to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to those, um, those, those sales,
you know, which is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your guys are passionate about what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I mean, well, you know, so,
so my growers, you know, and I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta give them credit because,
you know, it, it all starts with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, without them, then the rest of the
business is, you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they're almost all, you know,
brothers and cousins, they grew up on this
[SPEAKER_03]: really, you know, on a farm in a really
small town called Koloa, an island of Koi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, they grew up growing
vegetables, you know, sustenance farming,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would sell their, you know,
they go with their folks down to the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer's market and sell what they didn't
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, that's, that's where
they came from, where they were really
[SPEAKER_03]: relying on their land, you know,
to provide for their families.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, you know, now, you know,
they've kind of, you know, migrated up
[SPEAKER_03]: here and, uh, you know, the fact they're
sort of able to do that, but in this,
[SPEAKER_03]: in this different market, I think is
something they're very proud of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and it's, and it, you know,
shows in the product, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but they take a certain pride in the
gardens and, um, I know this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation science podcast, but,
you know, there's just, there's this one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing I haven't been able to, to sort of
like quantify scientifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's, you know,
just as love and this passion for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for being for your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, it, it shows up in the flavor
and it just shows up in, in, in the
[SPEAKER_03]: product at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I don't know how to
replicate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know we have something really
special and, and, um, we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: let the world know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of see it and, and,
and, you know, decide if that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's, that's for them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing we haven't mentioned
either is that your facility is fairly far
[SPEAKER_00]: south of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the guys live in Seattle,
even, uh, I think in, in North Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, and are driving all the way
down, uh, to the facility, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many miles is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it's in Olympia, Washington,
and you know, it's about a 60 mile drive
[SPEAKER_03]: each way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, we have most of our employees
and they make that drive both ways every
[SPEAKER_03]: day, you know, in traffic, you spend
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're getting up at, you know,
crazy hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the opportunity to work and be a
part of this community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, everybody has a
shared, shared, you know, sense that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: building something special and,
you know, to, you know, to come from a
[SPEAKER_03]: small place and be able to make your mark
and, you know, go into these stores and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, you know, hear the stories that,
you know, there was, there was people that
[SPEAKER_03]: were, you know, genuinely had their,
their day or their lives improved by,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, by your products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that, that's the kind of thing
that makes that drive worth it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, so yeah, we're just blessed
and, and, you know, we wouldn't do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the things that you
do, uh, at Goldleaf, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for, or with your employees that help
build that sense of community?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, I mean, even, even something as
simple as, you know, on Friday,
[SPEAKER_03]: we, you know, we, we all stop work a few
hours early and barbecue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just become this tradition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I don't know how it started,
just as long as I can remember,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've, you know, we, we break a little
early on Friday and we, everybody has a
[SPEAKER_03]: potluck and, and, um, yeah, that's kind of
a Hawaiian thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just, you know, everything,
you know, kind of, you know, orbits around
[SPEAKER_03]: food and community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, it's just, you know,
it's a special time where we're able to,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, just reflect and,
and, you know, have your team together
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and something that's not work
related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean,
it's, it, you know, it's the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the barbecue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they, you know, it's, it's such a
small thing, but yet I think it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just helps everybody remember that
like, yeah, we're this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's this team, we have a, we have a
greater goal and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're happy to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started running a kiss,
we would have staff meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not all working at the same time to
where we can get to do these sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: barbecues and things, but we're working on
more team building events and those
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to be together outside of
the, you know, outside of the workplace
[SPEAKER_00]: and not talking about work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, my, our farm manager's birthday
was last night and you know, over half the
[SPEAKER_00]: staff was there, you know, other people,
the guests were leaving and like the staff
[SPEAKER_00]: was there hanging out cause they enjoy
each other's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like some of the, some of the people
have taken trips to Iceland together or
[SPEAKER_00]: live together or have moved across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like those moments of community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started looking at staff
meetings, I was like, Oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calculating out how much this is
costing me per hour that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there and you know, people are
asking questions and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was 20 man hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is a lot of money that we could
be spent doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I matured as a leader or as a
business owner, I realized just how
[SPEAKER_00]: important this aspect was that people feel
like they're being heard, that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not spent being, you know,
stressed or working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that everyone gets along and likes
each other is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work environments can go a lot of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know there's a lot of places
where it's like, I don't want to see you
[SPEAKER_03]: till Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get out of there fast enough on
Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but yeah, you, you nailed it,
Ted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's, I think it comes down
to a sense of purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, you have not every job
at Goldleaf is, you know, is, is glamorous
[SPEAKER_03]: as the others, but I think that it's,
it's important to, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of develop that in everybody that
says, you know, it's like there's this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, quote for the stone masons and
it says, you know, we who cut humble stone
[SPEAKER_03]: must not forget we're building cathedrals,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know, even if you're
just trimming, and I totally butcher that
[SPEAKER_03]: quote, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, whether you're trimming or
you're packaging, or you're delivering,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, everybody realizes that this is
all part of that, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that customer experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, there's so much to
be learned from, from every person who
[SPEAKER_03]: works there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you and I, we both, you know,
wear a lot of hats or running our
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're not always down in the
trenches, you know, at least for myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, you know, I can't,
you know, I'm not always, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's, there's weeks I'm not even in
the gardens as much anymore because I have
[SPEAKER_03]: other things to attend to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and yet I'll find, you know,
the person with, you know, maybe one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the most homeless job, you know,
at our, at our farm will have insights
[SPEAKER_03]: into that part of the process that I
wouldn't be able to come up with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and allowing them, empowering
them to say, hey, you know, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: why don't you make this improvement?
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't about me telling you how to do
a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it's me finding the right
people who, who want to improve this
[SPEAKER_03]: company in any way they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and so giving them some,
some liberty, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: takes a certain amount of trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you find, I think you find overall
that when people do that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that gives them a sense of purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've improved this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've helped my company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody benefited from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's sort of really,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had told me another time we're talking
about one of your trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of told me a story around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to share that with the listeners
was that, which one was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's probably, it probably has to
do with, you know, Sono and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's our longtime trimmer, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had offered him other positions in
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, well, yeah, I mean, I've,
I've had a, you know, awesome kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been trimming for me for just,
you know, years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I, you know, he's
definitely earned the right to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, move into like, you know,
different jobs, but he just kind of has
[SPEAKER_03]: this, this old soul and this, this,
um, this, you know, uh, desire,
[SPEAKER_03]: this, this, um, how should I say this
affinity for kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's one, the craftsmanship,
you know, and this one little thing he
[SPEAKER_03]: does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He takes his one job of trimming,
which, you know, if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming for the cannabis industry is,
you know, some people think it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: dishwashing in the restaurant industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's where you got to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, you know, he takes so much pride
in, in trimming a perfect flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, what he's told me
is that, you know, I mean, these growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they put in so much time and energy from,
from taking a clone and all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: through it's, it's growing life and,
you know, the harvesting and the curing
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, he, it's his job to,
to give it that final manicure that the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's, you know, your customers
are going to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, that pride he has in that one
simple task really embodies, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just how, you know, how we try
to do everything we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, he, he's, I don't know,
he might be a trimmer forever and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, it's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he enjoys what he does.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he, he has purpose in his work
and, um, and he's quite talented at,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's good at what he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, I pay him well to do it
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you know, I'm going to continue to
promote you, but you can still be a
[SPEAKER_03]: trimmer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's earned that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take care of folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if his, you know, calling is to do
that one final detail, it's like detailing
[SPEAKER_03]: a car before you put it on the lot,
you know, it might not sound as cool as
[SPEAKER_03]: the guy engineering the car, but you know,
at the end of the day, that customer is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to want to see a nice shiny car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might be what, what makes him
purchase it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he understands that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think that sort of, that's,
that's definitely a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: an example for how we try to do everything
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about,
uh, where we are and sort of a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the, the coffee and some of your
products and how you guys brand your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff for listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the, uh, where do I start?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we're here at, you know,
origins coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's adjacent to origins recreational
cannabis shop in Redmond, Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've worked with them for a long time
and, and we love that they sort of are
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking outside the box with how people
are interacting with cannabis as a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: and with the brands, um, in general,
you know, and it's, uh, it takes a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of creative thinking to be,
you know, to make in this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you guys partnered on this,
this coffee and can you talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about where we're starting, you know,
at the actual origin of the coffee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Itself and why you're, why you're doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's the two things we
consume the most of is coffee and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as well, uh, get in business with both.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, um, I was, I've been
thinking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and,
um, there's a lot of restrictions on how I
[SPEAKER_03]: can, you know, really market and advertise
my cannabis brand, you know, just sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's socially responsible and,
and, um, you know, it's, it's an adult
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and even the state sets some
limitations on how, how and where we can
[SPEAKER_03]: advertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, obviously, you know, I'm, I'm thinking
about our brand, you know, eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: moving into, you know, possibly other
states and, you know, internationally one
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do I begin to export that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I can't ship my, my products
across state lines, you know, and so the
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee just seemed to be something that
sort of embodied a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, similar, similar, uh,
values.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we, we partnered with, um,
a roastery on the big Island and they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they work with a cooperative of,
of Kona coffee farmers, other coffee
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers in Hawaii, you know, small farms,
small family farms, organic, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: same values we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so hopefully now, you know,
if you get a buyer or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: get a bag of cold gold leaf coffee and
it's excellent too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, um, we made sure that we
made sure, Hey, if we're going to put the
[SPEAKER_03]: name on it's got to be really good,
you know, and, and so hopefully,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you, maybe you try the coffee
and, um, you say, wow, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, what's behind this brand?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, Oh, they also grow,
they also grow urban.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a, just a different way of
thinking about the brand as a whole,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, eventually perhaps it expands
beyond just cannabis into more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle and, uh, you know, culture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys are known for your
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what you've sort of,
uh, staked your mark on, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: produce other products as well.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond, uh, the flower, you're also,
can you talk a little bit about the layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and some of the other products
you've created to sort of diversify in
[SPEAKER_00]: this market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, you know, we, you know,
we start off pretty much strictly selling
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we partnered eventually with a
concentrate maker, polar ice tracks,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we do solvent free concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, hash, rosin, um, and, um,
that's been really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been winning some awards
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just a very pure process that
involves no chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, we figure, why are you going
to grow your, your, your flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: organically?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, process it with,
with, you know, hydrocarbons and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, other solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, uh, it's a solvent free,
you know, um, uh, concentrate processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we put them all together into
the can agars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is actually one of the smaller
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call this the Canarillo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it is a, it basically a cannabis
cigar and, um, it, it's, it's our flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's wrapped in a layer of the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we take the fan leaves from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of a tobacco wrap, it's,
you know, each leaf is meticulously,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, placed around that and cured and
dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole process takes months and you end
up with this, you know, kind of work of
[SPEAKER_03]: art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, I'll post some photos and stuff
for listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the podcast page, but then also,
um, I'll show some of the videos that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've shared with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one of the things that I just want
to mention while we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing branding, that's so important is
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branding is not just a t-shirt or a hat or
a coffee bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a collection of all of these
things to create an identity and a culture
[SPEAKER_00]: around what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, people have an idea of
not just where these products come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how they're grown, uh, and you really
have marketing and branding is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a holistic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not as easy as just running
out and buying a hundred t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create that social media
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create that understanding of
what you're doing and that recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that someone, someone sees that t-shirt
or that coffee or that hat, they can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that signifies this, you know,
quality community, you know, Aloha,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, whatever you're going for with
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I know that
origins has worked really hard on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will, uh, I will do a video tour
in there that we'll have on YouTube as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that we can share with people so they
can see how some of the more innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: rec shops are doing things here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, um, I think all I can say
about it is it's, it's authenticity,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you, you know, have a strong sense
of purpose in which you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: why you're doing what you're doing,
um, you kind of build your marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: around that, it, it'll, you know,
it'll, it'll work out well for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think if, if you're trying to put
out a message that doesn't truly represent
[SPEAKER_03]: who you are, then it's, it's just going to
kind of fall apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but yeah, you know, you gotta,
you gotta approach it from so many
[SPEAKER_03]: different angles and, um, and you know,
it's exciting times because there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: many platforms now to get your message
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you don't have to throw a ton of money
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the hard dollars, like you did
before, you know, taking out magazine ads
[SPEAKER_03]: and billboards and all of these,
these costs, you can be very creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can use people to,
to spread the message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, um, nothing's better than,
you know, like a firsthand recommendation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, and so those are,
those are things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you try to cultivate as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point about being
authentic because we, nowadays we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: bombarded with messages all the time in
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people, even at a subconscious
level, at the very least can tell when a
[SPEAKER_00]: message is, is fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, is there anything else that you
want to touch on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
chat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and, and, you know,
thanks again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always appreciate your, your help with
us sort of coming into our own as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as organic growers and, and, um,
you know, we're, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I definitely know we wouldn't be
who we are and, and, and how we are,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it wasn't for sort of our, you know,
um, opportunity to run into you at that
[SPEAKER_03]: transition time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to collaborate
with people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you and I are always learning
new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I learned something new related
to soil, I think matter would matter for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you discover something,
you know, you're sharing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how we all stay
competitive, you know, with absolutely,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I, I think I, you know,
I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's, um, you know,
there's, there's, there needs to be more
[SPEAKER_03]: unity, you know, uh, the cannabis
industry, you know, as, as things get
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive, you know, the, the gloves
come off and it can, it can, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's kind of fighting for their
own, but I don't think it has to be like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you look at other industries,
um, and, um, like-minded brands can come
[SPEAKER_03]: together and, um, and there's a lot,
there's a lot to go around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, looking forward to the next
chapters as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Nate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
