[SPEAKER_00]: Okay we're going to go ahead and install
our carrots into our bed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see now I've got the quick
disconnect coming from the water supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: a break there and a break here and our end
of line valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That break by the way is totally up to you
as far as where you want to put them so
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole piece of tubing will come as
one piece and then as you lay it out
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll simply just cut with a pair of
scissors where you want to put your valves
[SPEAKER_00]: and your carrots and uh and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing we're going to do is we're
going to grab a carrot that's been soaking
[SPEAKER_00]: in some fresh water for about an hour a
little bit longer than needed but I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to go a little bit long so that's an hour
and what I'm going to do now you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: water level right up to the top as it's
upright I'm going to go ahead and screw
[SPEAKER_00]: that on so it's thumb tight not crazy and
then as you'll see it's got the T you
[SPEAKER_00]: already need to go into your supply line
so plug that in there make sure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the other side and then we'll go
ahead and shove that in so you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: see the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grab our other carrot this one I've
already put the cap on put it on there
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure we're clean and I like to run
kind of caddy corner and opposite so then
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're going to do we're going to dial
this one down tighten it we'll open this
[SPEAKER_00]: one up and we're going to turn on our
water and there you go the other thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember is keep that that last valve
closed you make sure you get your good
[SPEAKER_00]: water coming out of there now this is a
pressurized hookup you might not see this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stream coming out of gravity but
that's okay I'm going to tighten this down
[SPEAKER_00]: and do the hanging drip which I will show
you close-up of in a little bit later on
[SPEAKER_00]: so once we're dialed in we have our drip a
little bit more a little bit more there we
[SPEAKER_00]: go we'll do two quote unquote clicks one
two and then this one we'll just leave for
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then you have your little blue
mat caps and these are great because they
[SPEAKER_00]: sit and snap on and that way if anything
gets bumped you're good now the next step
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be to install your drip tape
the fitting you're going to be working
[SPEAKER_00]: with is this three millimeter by drip tape
adapter I'll show you how to screw this on
[SPEAKER_00]: in another video as well so this simply
just gets plugged into here and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: would route this around whatever you're
planting and then if you've got a stake
[SPEAKER_00]: lying around which we will make sure you
do put one on the middle there and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to throw one on the end and that's kind of
it you do the other carrot this one go
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then similarly just wrap kind of
equal and opposite and that would be about
[SPEAKER_00]: it so as you can kind of see you're going
to make sure that you've got your edges
[SPEAKER_00]: covered and you've got a nice middle line
to have irrigation through the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bed but most of your
evapotranspiration is going to come from
[SPEAKER_00]: the edge which is why it's nice to have
those blue soak drip tapes making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're covered there
[SPEAKER_00]: all right I want to show everybody what I
was talking about when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing in your sensor or your carrot
because they kind of look like carrots I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: at my desk because there's no water hooked
up here but if you would imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrewing this to the point where you can
move this freely through there then you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have some water coming out there pretty
steadily so we're going to do when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually setting these up is we'll hold
this flat parallel to the ground and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tighten this valve down until we have what
we like to call that hanging drip which is
[SPEAKER_00]: a drip coming out of here about once every
one to three seconds once you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use any wood you know marker on
the side of this cap this fin is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great one and then you're going to tighten
down this valve to what I like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: clicks and a click is there's basically
these triangles that surround the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the valve so we would tighten one and two
and that's a neutral setting so then it
[SPEAKER_00]: would take those cool caps and those big
gaps go around the hose and that way if it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets knocked nothing's going to adjust it
you're not going to flutter you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cut off irrigation so that's how
to properly set for a neutral setting your
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot now if you need to make an
adjustment remember if you're going even
[SPEAKER_00]: between half of these two triangles these
clicks that's a 25% adjustment right there
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lot so if you do need to dial
it up if it needs to be wetter then you
[SPEAKER_00]: would back it off if it needs to be drier
you would tighten it down a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more I would recommend not going more than
half a click for any one adjustment
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you do that you could get into
some trouble as far as over or under
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating also make sure that you leave
enough time I'd say at least a few days to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how these different adjustments you
would make would work before you adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: again all right I wanted to show you guys
how to hook up your end-of-line flush
[SPEAKER_00]: valve there's also a note here that if you
do get the pressure kit with the pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: reducer then this collar is the same on
the pressure reducer as it is on the on
[SPEAKER_00]: the valve so to do that all you do is to
take this collar all the way off it
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrews thread that through there and
then that gets fitted on top of that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's nice and snug and then you just
throw that back on tighten it all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down and there you go now if you are using
this as your end-of-line valve then
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing would go here but if you needed to
check your pressure or make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do have water flowing you would just turn
that going that way water would flow
[SPEAKER_00]: through and then you'd be able to check
additionally if you ever need to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: your system add another container or two
all you would need to do is do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on this side pull that off put the
other supply line on this end collar it
[SPEAKER_00]: back on and then this valve would just
stay open and then you would let you
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate any containers downstream from
here
[SPEAKER_00]: all right I'm going to show you guys how
to hook up any of your blue soak drip tape
[SPEAKER_00]: fittings this one here is a three
millimeter to drip tape adapter and then
[SPEAKER_00]: this one here is your end plug which is
basically just the other end to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: water doesn't just come flowing out of
there but we'll use this one to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: started you want to make sure that this
ring is all the way butted up against
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was so you can't see any of those
threads so like that the drip tape will
[SPEAKER_00]: have this kind of fin on here the trick
here is to fold that down and you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: then throw that in but this direction
needs to be pointed it needs to be folded
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same direction that you're
threading your cap on otherwise you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: a leak so don't be too scared to really
clamp this one down so I'll hold this and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll actually twist this one so
that's pretty tight and then you also want
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it a good check so I'm pulling on
that pretty good it's not going anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of the drip tape would be the
same just with this plug make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up against that side throw it
on there fold that flap in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: direction you're twisting tighten it down
give it a pull test and you're good to go you
