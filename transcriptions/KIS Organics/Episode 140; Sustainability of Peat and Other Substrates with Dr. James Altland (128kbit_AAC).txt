[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before starting the podcast,
I want to remind folks that we do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon for growers who want to access to
the unedited podcast weeks earlier as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as extra content on our own grows,
virtual hangouts, a private Discord
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, and more that we don't share
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check it out for a free trial if
interested to see if it can help you with
[SPEAKER_00]: your cultivation goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my guest this week is Dr. James
Altland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Altland is a research horticulturalist
and the research leader for the USDA ARS
[SPEAKER_00]: Application Technology Research Unit,
also known as the ATRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the role of the ATRU has
historically been to develop new pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application technologies, it has shifted
its focus in the last five years to
[SPEAKER_00]: developing CEA technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: While leading a team of 10 scientists in
various aspects of CEA from entomology,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathology, engineering, and
horticulture, Dr. Altland's expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: encompasses the development of substrate
technologies for containerized plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: With collaborations at Ohio State
University, this has recently evolved into
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial community analysis of
container substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for inviting me,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I caught most of your presentation that
you did for the American Society for
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticultural Science, talking about the
long-term sustainability of peat in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I think, such an important
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you were selected to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the speaker on this particular topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a horticulture scientist for the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture, what we call
the Agricultural Research Service.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working with soilless
substrates for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of my research has been with
Douglas Furbark when I worked out at
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University, Pinebark here on
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard all the rumblings about the
use of peat and the sustainability of peat
[SPEAKER_01]: and its impacts on climate change,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, peat's an excellent
substrate, but, you know, I didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: pay much attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really what I was focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I attended a conference up in
Quebec last summer on peatland
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I saw and what I experienced at
that conference and going out and visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the peat bogs did not mesh well
with what I'm hearing in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I wanted to do was to,
and a lot of what I hear in the media is a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of, you know, a lot of diatribe,
a lot of, you know, just what's the word
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is why editing is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of comments that aren't
substantiated by facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to do is add some context,
some factual basis for this conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: and let growers and others make their own
informed decision about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sustainability of peat versus all the
other alternatives that we might have in
[SPEAKER_01]: lieu of peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I absolutely want to talk about
some of the alternatives that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, like the wood fibers,
the pine bar, coco core, obviously is a
[SPEAKER_00]: big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about substrates,
you also have to include things like
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and rockwool, which we know are
not very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so for me, as someone who grew
up in the nursery industry and has been in
[SPEAKER_00]: the horticulture industry pretty much my
entire life, I've heard very mixed things
[SPEAKER_00]: about peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to one person and you hear that
peat is destroying the world, huge carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints, and it's quite damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you talk to other people,
you know, you talk to you read what's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the premier pro mix website, for example,
and it'll say that peat is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like there's science on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very confusing for an average
grower to figure out what if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be sustainable and be environmentally
conscious, what our options are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your presentation right at the
beginning, you share some headlines from
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York Times saying why gardeners
should stop using peat and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: should use instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one from Better Homes and Gardens
talking about how peat is a sore point in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry due to its lack of
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then National Geographic, one that we
talked about before the show, the headline
[SPEAKER_00]: to their article is potting soil has a
dirty secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there definitely is a media push
towards moving away from peat or that peat
[SPEAKER_00]: is really harming our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't have a dog in this fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get any money from the peat
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't as an employee for the federal
government, I can't accept money from
[SPEAKER_01]: outside interests like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would like to what I'm trying to
do with some of these presentations that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done is just share the facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you look objectively at
the facts that you come to the conclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: that, yes, there is a price tag
environmentally for using peat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but oftentimes the price tag for using
these alternatives that are touted are
[SPEAKER_01]: much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing I like to do is to put
in the context what is the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint of growing media or peat
specifically relative to some other human
[SPEAKER_01]: activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at it from that
perspective, you know, and one thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell people, we're not using peat or other
substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it to power private jets and
luxury yachts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using this to grow food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it to grow forest seedlings
for reforestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using it to grow plants for the
urban landscape, which have
[SPEAKER_01]: well-documented benefits on human wellness
and mental health and all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say, well, we don't need
petunias, but you know, the truth is even
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plants have value to our
society and to human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using these soilless media for
very good reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we do it in the most sustainable
way possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't make those decisions without
facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm trying to share with
people is just what does the data tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the sustainability of these
various growing media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to get into the data,
but I really think there's two things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to look at when we're talking
about substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first is first and foremost is
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before we get into the
sustainability of these substrates in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of performance, where does peat rank
on the scale of horticultural substrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can read, I could fill this room
with scientific studies looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives to peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason why we don't have a
good one yet is because peat generally
[SPEAKER_01]: outperforms other substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that it is processed, it's very
uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been growing with this for over 60
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just gotten very good at engineering
the substrate, developing fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: programs and irrigation programs so that
we can optimize the growth and development
[SPEAKER_01]: of our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you change that to a different
material, oftentimes it requires more
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, more water, more time,
and those all cost carbon, energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: time, dollars, everything, labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of just ranking the
substrates, peat really is the gold
[SPEAKER_01]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to get that out there
for folks because I think that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know as myself and my company search for
other alternatives for peat, we keep
[SPEAKER_00]: falling short because ultimately we want
to create the best product for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, peat really is
that standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing, and this is probably
a little bit outside of your world,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in my industry, by starting with peat
moss, which is so acidic, it allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: add more cations, more fertilizer
essentially into that media so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: create a more fertile mix than I could
with cocoa core, for example, because
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa core starting with a neutral pH
starts pushing us into outside of range,
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal pH ranges for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with peat moss, I can add biochar
that's alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add compost that's alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add a variety of different
fertilizers to reach a pH range that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still quite acceptable for nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention that for the
folks that are listening, because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of people that grow grow
similarly to the way we do in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a very fertile soil mix in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very good at raising the pH of
substrates, you know, a small degree like
[SPEAKER_01]: peat and pine bark falls in that same
category, generally has a low pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very good at elevating the pH to the
right level.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have to lower the pH because your
substrate starts out already too neutral
[SPEAKER_01]: or basic, that becomes very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it, but then we run into a lot
of other problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not nearly as neat and clean as
when you start with a low pH substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: like peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's dive into the data then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just from looking over your
presentation here, where would you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk about the peat bogs
themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you want to get into some of the
data around carbon sequestration and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's good to start with peat
bogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is a peat bog or a peat land?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they so important?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does that factor in to the global
climate change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's really what's driving this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that, oh, I want a substrate that
works better than peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information out there,
a lot of disinformation about how using
[SPEAKER_01]: peat affects climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be a good place to start if
you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really know what a peat bog was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we should differentiate
between the United States and or I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: North America would probably be better and
Europe and Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a peat bog and what is the
condition of the peat bogs across?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess globally would be the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so peat lands or peat bogs are
really it's a type of wetland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about wetlands,
but peatlands are special in that as
[SPEAKER_01]: plants die and start to decay,
that the organic matter accumulates faster
[SPEAKER_01]: than it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a buildup of this organic layer
beneath the wetland or the peat land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's a layer of peat then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what characterizes a peat land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the important characteristics
of a peat land is that water will saturate
[SPEAKER_01]: up to about near the surface at the
surface or near the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can imagine, that type of land
would not be conducive to building roads
[SPEAKER_01]: or houses or farms or anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you have to do when you
use that land is you have to drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you drain the water off of it and then
that peat land becomes degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in the history of humanity,
you can look at the history of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been using those peat lands for
farmland and other reasons for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: longer than we have been in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that has resulted in is over half
of the peat lands in Europe are now
[SPEAKER_01]: degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a degraded peat land will tend to give
off CO2 instead of sequestering CO2 from
[SPEAKER_01]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The situation's a lot different in North
America where we've just had fewer people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of these peat lands in North
America are in Canada at very high
[SPEAKER_01]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where there's not a lot of people
living to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the peat lands in North America are in
much better health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of the things that we
discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so a healthy functioning peat
land will have water at or near the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface and it's constantly sequestering
CO2 from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes them so valuable
globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're removing CO2 from the atmosphere
instead of giving CO2 off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I try to visually picture peat
land, because peat is primarily just a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of organic matter that's broken down
and become this sort of stable substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know as peat moss, I would assume
these lands are quite rich with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in order for there to be plant
matter to be broken down to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are there grasses and shrubs and
things like that on the land or are they
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly barren looking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you talk about peat lands,
there are two major types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is called a fen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard that word probably
before just casually, but a fen is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: an early development peat land and they're
dominated by sedges and grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time and as the characteristics of
that peat land change and basically they
[SPEAKER_01]: start to swell up above the water table,
they become a bog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a bog is typically dominated by
stagnant moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see shrubs and some other plants
and even maybe some trees growing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: peat land or a peat bog, but they're
dominated by the sphagnum mosses,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is where as those mosses grow and
then decay beneath, that's where we get
[SPEAKER_01]: this coveted sphagnum moss from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you think, and I have some
pictures on here that you can show maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: in the podcast, but I always envisioned
them as being kind of like those images
[SPEAKER_01]: you see at the tundra, but there is a
little more variety of plant life when you
[SPEAKER_01]: visit them in person, especially the ones
that I visited in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, more shrubs, more trees than you
might expect, but they are dominated by
[SPEAKER_01]: the sphagnum mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were your initial thoughts when
you actually visited and saw them in
[SPEAKER_00]: person?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the differences between what you
had pictured in your head and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess one of the things that
struck me, we visited what they would call
[SPEAKER_01]: a pristine bog, never been touched or
never been altered in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we visited a rehabilitated or restored
peat bog post extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they extracted peat from this for 10,
20, 30 years, I'm not sure how long,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they restored it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: My eyes couldn't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe a biologist would come in and
they see they're looking for certain plant
[SPEAKER_01]: species or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, visually, they look very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really struck by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really strange when you walk on these
peat bogs, just how, I guess, not a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific term, but how squishy they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you really sink down in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put your hand down in there and
pull up a big clump of peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fascinating to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should do that if they get the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hearing about their restoration
efforts and the success that they had,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more of a conservation practice,
is what I observe, than what some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: media would have you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're strip mining Canada, and it's just
not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: The area that they're harvesting peat from
is incredibly small, and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: restoring it afterwards anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a different narrative than
what you see in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's throw some numbers at people
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at your slides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you talk about pristine peat
bogs, you mentioned that sphagnum mosses
[SPEAKER_00]: grow slowly, about 20 to 120 millimeters
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And peat accumulates at about half to one
millimeter per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give people some numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What amount of peat is actually being
harvested in North America right now
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the vast size geographically
of peatlands?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me pull up those numbers so I
don't say something inaccurate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're looking that up,
I'll add one more fact here from your
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, is that peatlands cover about 3% of
the Earth's land area, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a massive source of carbon
sequestration, which is why this is such
[SPEAKER_00]: an important topic for people that are
concerned about the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me get back to that point,
because that's really interesting too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that gets to the heart of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to put this in the perspective,
every year during a good year,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will harvest of around 12 million
cubic meters of peat to sell for
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can estimate this several
different ways, but what I've estimated
[SPEAKER_01]: that the peatlands in Canada are
accumulating about 600 million cubic
[SPEAKER_01]: meters of peat every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're harvesting 12 and another 600
million cubic meters are being generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because almost all of the peatland,
well, over 80% of the peatlands in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: are still in a pristine condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're untouched, unfazed by human
activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although they grow at a very small
rate, there's such a massive land area
[SPEAKER_01]: that is growing peat that it's
accumulating 50 to 100 times faster than
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being harvested for horticultural
purposes in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's growing at a very rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me take that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not growing at a rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing much more than it is being
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale of it is so massive that we're
accumulating it faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really fascinating to me because
that is something that you hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite a lot, is that we're harvesting
peat way faster than it's accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're demolishing these beautiful
Canadian bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to highlight that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I said, the image they
paint is that we're strip mining Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: The area that's being harvested is really
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now over that, let's say they remove a
layer of about one meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the life of that bog, it may take 10
or 15 years to do that, but let's say they
[SPEAKER_01]: remove a layer of one meter deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because they're only bros,
about a half a millimeter to a millimeter
[SPEAKER_01]: a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to replace that meter,
it would take like a thousand years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the arguments often thrown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting peat from these bogs and
it's going to take centuries for it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is once they're done
harvesting, what amounts to reseeding it
[SPEAKER_01]: with sphagnum?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fairly involved process and to
restore those peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they're done, those peat bogs
become carbon accumulation creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon sequestering, fully functioning
bogs again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start accumulating carbon and peat
almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within several years, it can take three to
maybe 10 or 15 years, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But well short of that 1000 year window
that people like to convince you that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take to restore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become functioning peat bogs again,
relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're saying is this
idea that once a bog has been harvested,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, it will take hundreds, if not
thousands of years for that bog to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the level of peat moss that it
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, during that time, it's still
going to be sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's such a small overall
percentage of peatlands that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still growing more peat than we're
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considerably more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massively more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat in Canada is accumulating way faster
than horticulture is using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, one to two orders of magnitude
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and let's touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sphagnum peat moss coming out of
Canada is primarily used, 90% of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to your slide, goes to the
United States and it's all used for
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is not the case in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Europe is a very different situation
than North America when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: uses for peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one thing Europe does have in common,
all of the peat harvested in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: 96% of it stays in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the first things that
drew me to this discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe has a much longer history than we
have here in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can touch on that a little bit too
in terms of population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the peatlands in Europe are in very
bad condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peatlands in North America are in
relatively very good condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do in North America for
growers, we're using the peat from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be based on the conditions here
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Europe handle their problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peat we use in North America comes
from North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peat used in Europe comes from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now getting back to Europe,
right now, 62% of the peat that they
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest there is used for energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that has never been done
in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have never used Canadian peat to
generate fuel or to heat homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of it is used for that purpose in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: 38% of the peat, they call it in this
paper, it's been cited there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 38% is what they call non-energy uses,
but that's all horticulture when you read
[SPEAKER_01]: between the lines, all of that peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either energy or horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the case in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting it just for horticulture
in this continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would assume combustion of peat has
further carbon consequences, would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the carbon footprint of
peat use from horticulture, we assume that
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it is mineralized or decomposed at
some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I give you the numbers for the carbon
footprint of peat, that's assuming all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that is harvested is converted into CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would get the same result by
burning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even that said, when you look at the
numbers for the carbon footprint of peat
[SPEAKER_01]: as relatively small compared to other
human activities and even other
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting because when I think of
peat use in horticulture, I assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an ecological cost to the
harvesting, which there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once I as a consumer receive that
plant or soil, the plant that's planted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the peat moss that I'm planting into my
yard, I look at it more as a
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribution of a peat moss into my
local native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I realize there are people that
are using this media and then it's ending
[SPEAKER_00]: up in landfills and things, which is
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that to me has, I guess, a different
ecological or environmental impact than
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when they calculate the carbon
footprint, you may not see this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that peat within 100 years is going to
decompose probably completely in your
[SPEAKER_01]: yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plant salia in your garden,
the peat moss is going to be gone within
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're assuming all that has been
converted to CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at the carbon footprint
for peat, that's a worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably, as you say,
much better because you're using it to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow plants, maybe you're using it to grow
four seedlings that turn into 80 foot tall
[SPEAKER_01]: spruce trees on the side of Mount Hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the carbon footprint the way they
calculate it is a worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of it comes from the actual
carbon stored in the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were your findings in regards to
the studies and research on peat and other
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates and their carbon impacts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing I'd like to bring up first
before we get into that is just the global
[SPEAKER_01]: climate situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why this is such a concern to so many
people is that if you look on planet
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth, and that slide that I showed you,
this is on slide 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there are about 885 gigatons of
CO2 stored in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a gigaton is just simply a billion
metric tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 885 billion metric tons of CO2 or CO2
equivalents in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils around the globe contain about 1,700
gigatons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that, 550 to 600 gigatons are stored in
peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem is, and the concern is,
if we continue to degrade peatlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we continue to lose that carbon into
the atmosphere, what if even half or a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of that 550 to 600 gigatons is
released into the atmosphere to join the
atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the 885 gigatons already there,
well, that would be an ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why there's such a push to
maintain the CO2 sequestering functions of
[SPEAKER_01]: peatlands around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you go to the next slide,
this shows how the change in CO2 levels
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by human activities around the
globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, our biome, forest,
grasslands, et cetera, can absorb about
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.6 gigatons every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oceans absorb about 2.8 gigatons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So planet Earth, under natural processes,
is absorbing around 9 or 10 gigatons of
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 from the atmosphere every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, humans are given off about
60 gigatons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, 20 gigatons comes from energy
production, burning coal, burning fossil
[SPEAKER_01]: fuels, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 gigatons comes from industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this term called AFOLU,
or A-F-O-L-U.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you would sound that out,
but it stands for agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: forestry, and other land uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's given off 13 gigatons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically farming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in that number, there's the Canadian
peat industry that is responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: generating 0.0 0.0 9 gigatons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at the global scorecard,
it's a very small fraction coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the concern is, maintaining the
quality of peat lands around the globe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but can we use peat from Canada for
horticultural purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on this data, the carbon
footprint on an annual basis of using
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural peat is so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not zero, but it is very small
relative to other human activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at your slide, you're saying
like 8.7 gigatons of carbon or CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: released through transportation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, Canadian peat is 0.0 0.0 9
gigatons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's substantially less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a pretty terrifying slide
when you think about it in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of sequestration we're having
relative to the amount of release.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of Canadian peat,
you're saying it's rather negligible or
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Negligible relative to other activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should always strive for zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we're growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using this peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not burning it for fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not powering luxury yachts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing forest seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has further sequestration properties
as it adds to our overall quote unquote
[SPEAKER_00]: biome as it's used in this image.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I talk about at the
end of my talk is that the only tool we
[SPEAKER_01]: have right now, the only reasonable tool
we have for reversing CO2 levels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere is reforestation of land that
is currently not forested in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reasonable way to do that is
to drastically ramp up our reforestation
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries, our forest seedling nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now studies by the forest seedling
industry has said the best way to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: is use container grown forest seedlings
that use peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an irony of irony is the one material
that may help us get out of this mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we move on, can you just touch
on Europe again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you mentioned that a lot of it's
used for energy, that they have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, is there a solution for
folks in Europe in terms of other options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the conversation around peat quite
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you lived in London, would you use
peat moss versus if you lived in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe in Europe, there is much
greater scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they banned all harvests of peat from
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to shut down peat harvesting
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what has happened, though,
is they're just getting their peat from
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else like Latvia or Estonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they haven't stopped the use of peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just shifted where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ireland's taking care of Ireland,
but they're still using peat, I guess is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now they have been very proactive in
using wood fibers and other alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, comes with its own set of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and when I talk to some of
my European colleagues, what is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: legislated?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is proposed?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is actually being done in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to be you know,
give a concise overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is more pressure for
environmental legislation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more pressure against using it
just socially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they want to phase it out
completely from England by the year 2030.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but keeping track of what is proposed
versus what is actually done has been
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat challenging, you know,
from this side of the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this might be a good time to
transition into other substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that you did in your
presentation was you look, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been talking about sort of the
environmental impacts of peat moss as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to make a determination,
a true determination about a substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to also look at its social and
human health impacts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is a really important
aspect, especially when we start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about things that are being transported
over large distances to get to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we kind of cover peat moss first
from sort of this, I think you call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle analysis in terms of human
health effects, social effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental, and then we can do the same
with some of these other substrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now some of your listeners probably
have heard about this before, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a there's a process called a life
cycle analysis or life cycle assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they try to quantitatively measure
the impacts of any service, any process or
[SPEAKER_01]: any product on, you know, the environment,
human health, society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're constantly
expanding what they can measure the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal of these is to do a fair and
objective quantitative analysis to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine how these how these products
impact against society and the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at peat, we can measure
the big one is the carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many kilograms of CO2 per cubic meter
of peat is released in the atmosphere when
[SPEAKER_01]: you harvest that peat and use it for
horticulture?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those values range from 20 to 150
kilograms of CO2 equivalent per cubic
[SPEAKER_01]: meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is, you know, you can look at
different studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each study makes a different set of
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was that peat harvested?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far was it transported?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how was it used?
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on those assumptions,
they will come up with slightly different
[SPEAKER_01]: values.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, most of the values
range from about 20 to 50 kilograms of CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was as high as 150.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some variability there,
but now, as we discussed before we got on
[SPEAKER_01]: here, a lot of this data comes from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only have one study, to my
knowledge, that was done in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they determined that the
carbon footprint was about 50 kilograms
[SPEAKER_01]: per cubic meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you compare that to core,
just in terms of its CO2 equivalence or
[SPEAKER_01]: its carbon footprint in most studies,
but not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most studies, core has a slightly lower
carbon footprint than does peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the carbon footprint is only one
part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at the environmental impact
that also considers things like
[SPEAKER_01]: terrestrial acidification, fresh and
marine water eutrophication, ecotoxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: land use, fossil resource scarcity,
and water consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you factor all those in, core
becomes, it has a higher relative impact
[SPEAKER_01]: than peat, usually much worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has to do with how core
is processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses a tremendous amount of water,
and it also releases a high salt load into
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment wherever it's done in
order to flush the salts from the core
[SPEAKER_01]: pith.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, when you look at the total
environmental impact, generally peat has a
[SPEAKER_01]: much lower impact than does core or other
products like rock wool and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I first started looking into
this, I was trying to put together an
[SPEAKER_00]: article comparing peat versus cocoa,
because it was something that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I found was
with cocoa core, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a huge water consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water is at a premium these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean water is something that we struggle
with globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a lot of water to flush all
the salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, that salt has to go
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that clean core has to be dried
and compressed and shipped all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: over here to North America, because it's
being harvested in tropical areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that surprised me
too that we haven't talked about and that
[SPEAKER_00]: falls under sort of the social human
health aspect is the respiratory effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was having.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been generating economic
wealth for a particular community,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was causing huge respiratory
problems for the workers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that has changed since
I first looked into this 15 or so years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was something that I thought was
a considerable point to consider when
[SPEAKER_00]: making a substrate decision too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all the core today, most of it comes
from Sri Lanka or India, although they are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to develop some products from South
America as well now, harvesting from South
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also measure human health impact
that includes things like toxic effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: carcinogens, respiratory effects that you
mentioned, ionizing radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: fine particulate matter, and ozone
depletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you factor those things in,
again, in every study that we have data
[SPEAKER_01]: for both PEAT and core, core has a higher
human health impact than does PEAT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in one case, Rockwell was actually
lower than core, but Rockwell was also
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing I will say is that I
believe there's been a lot of investment
[SPEAKER_01]: in the core in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some large companies from North America
are investing in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they are... So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started using core,
there was lots of concerns about worker
[SPEAKER_01]: safety, worker conditions, and some of
these developing countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of that has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think corporate investment and those
sorts of things has improved that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I don't have firsthand knowledge
of it, that's just what I suspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, I mean, these studies were done
in the last two or three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: the human health impact of core is still
greater than what PEAT is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with this, I just would like to
add that I'm making personally the
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption that Rockwell and perlite are
worse substrates than PEAT or COCO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of ranking them in terms of
environmental impact as from lowest to
[SPEAKER_00]: highest going sort of PEAT, COCO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would assume perlite then
Rockwell is the major substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell is something that's used,
of course, by hydroponic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of almost a whole
different category.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either use it completely or not at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But perlite is something that we've always
traditionally mixed in with our substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially PEAT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone in the industry,
from grower up to substrate providers,
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers, everyone, that's the first
thing that people are looking to replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking to get away from
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I get a nasty email from the
perlite manufacturers every time I say
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a tough one because,
I mean, perlite works so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we use pumice and arsenol mixes
because it's heavier, which is great from
[SPEAKER_00]: a substrate perspective, but in terms of
shipping and those sorts of things and
[SPEAKER_00]: fossil fuel costs, it's definitely higher
to move pumice around.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's so awful about
the cannabis industry, which I'm a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of, is that a lot of people are throwing
out this media.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least with Rockwell, people are now
starting to reuse it and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of perlite, the amount of
coco core and peat moss that gets put into
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills or dumped out every round is
really quite a contributor, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: to environmental damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, and you don't know me,
we haven't talked about this, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that my company does is we work
with folks in creating, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the cannabis, putting it into a
soil bed, let's just say a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: bed of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the cycle,
we will soil test and reuse that media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just adding nutrients back into
it, treating it more like agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we do have the environmental
impact of starting with peat moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not adding more media every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reusing that substrate over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have people that have been doing
this for five to 10 years, now,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, to me, feels better,
at least, when I'm using peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I feel like I'm creating a
highest use case for it from a
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural perspective to where I'm
having less environmental impact once that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is created and in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are lots of creative ways that
you can reuse peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, especially post-production,
it's an excellent soil amendment if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have that outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearby, where you can apply it to
agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I know using some of the mineral
products like rock wool or perlite,
[SPEAKER_01]: disposal is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned pumice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a professor at Oregon State
University for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we work with pumice a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting material to work
with and a very good substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you share a little bit about pumice?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you have some experience
with it in comparison to perlite and other
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in the Oregon nursery industry,
it was used... Now, this is outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery crops, woody plants, container
nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used almost exclusively relative to
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't use perlite in nursery crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used Douglas fir bark and pumice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went and visited... At the time,
there were two sources of pumice in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: One from the Bend area and one down in
southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the exact region.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just visiting those pumice mines and
seeing how they mine it from the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at some of the chemical
and physical characteristics of the pumice
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it's used in nursery crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've wrote some articles years and
years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the details anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use it like 10 to 20% of the
growing of the container mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was relatively minor, a component in
the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was interesting looking at
it, especially visiting the mines and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how it's extracted and processed
and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the differences between
perlite and pumice for people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: unfamiliar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say the primary difference
that you mentioned is the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumice is just heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost, if you're not... To the
untrained eye, it might even look the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, feel the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a porous volcanic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pumice out of Bend was very white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might almost be tricked into
thinking it was perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumice out of southern Oregon had a...
It was stained.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ribbon of pumice they were mining was
closer to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was stained a little more yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't look as bright gleaming
white as the Bend pumice did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, as far as growing
media, other than it increased the bulk
[SPEAKER_01]: density of your media a little more
relative to what perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really didn't measure anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no measurable difference in
chemical properties or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least from what we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just about the same particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the products that we use in the
nursery industry were a little dustier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of fines in them,
the pumice product, unless you had a
[SPEAKER_01]: double screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, it was very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had to move to using two thirds
medium, one third large pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that reason, when we use just medium
pumice, the amount of fines in there
[SPEAKER_00]: actually created less aeration and ended
up being this sort of goopy mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, as I think about other things
that we can add to media for aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanna transition into a pine bark
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I look for other options for
aeration, in my industry, people will use
[SPEAKER_00]: rice holes as a form of aeration,
but that has sustainability issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also is potentially a source of
arsenic, which because cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested now for heavy metal content at
very, very strict levels in some regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: states, that can be a huge contributor and
a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also makes it hard to use things like
volcanic lava rock, because as that breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down, if you're reusing your media,
that also could be adding heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the pumice that we've seen is
pretty clean, relative minerally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really have a lot of heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention that as a sort
of an aside around aeration options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found a better one, but maybe
exploration of pine bark or some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other wood substrates is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are your thoughts on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so one thing is that I did research
with biochars about 10 or 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem was at the time,
it was an interesting product to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with, but there was no source,
no large volume source of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as people talked about it and
how exciting biochar was, you really
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't find it for a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's changed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what has changed in the
energy sector, but now there are more
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, abundant sources of biochar
commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I know one of the
major substrate manufacturers now are
[SPEAKER_01]: using biochar instead of perlite as the
kind of the coarse quote unquote aggregate
[SPEAKER_01]: that you put in the media to provide
drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so presumably biochar would be very
stable for very long periods of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have some of the heavy metal
toxicities that you might find with other
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral sources from the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood fibers are something, I think we
discussed this a little bit before we got
[SPEAKER_01]: on the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that started in Europe
and now you can find an abundant supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: that in North America as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least one major manufacturer
and there may be two or three coming
[SPEAKER_01]: online soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But literally taking the wood portion of
pine trees and I'm not sure the mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: process they put it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some sort of disc extrusion I think,
but it creates a fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a wooden Brillo pad is
what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very difficult to mix and very difficult
to work with from a mixing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need specialized equipment to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have that equipment and you can
mix it, it does create a fairly good
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can replace up to 30 to 40% of the
peat or maybe use that as the aeration
[SPEAKER_01]: component of your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to back up for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad you brought up biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I sort of take for
granted because it's something we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using for a long time and I've done
podcasts just on biochar because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, that is another great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an experiment with using it as more
than 8% of my total media primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: because of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when we talk about biochar,
it's like compost just for listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, they're not all created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particle size is going to have a big
impact in terms of the gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture retention, aeration effects of
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just go out and buy a bag of
biochar and think that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do a little bit more research
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think biochar would be a great
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still find it prohibitively expensive to
get quality biochar in a media.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a high percentage, but for a home
grower, that might be quite reasonable to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider experimenting with at higher
ratios than the 8% that we go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have been working with is more
of like a 15% on a volumetric basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably closer to you in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, as a scientist, one of the last
things I think about sometimes is the
[SPEAKER_01]: price, which maybe I should think about
that more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what the grower ultimately
is going to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what the cost on the
material we've been working with has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a wood-based biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I work with these companies that do
the pyrolysis, they're primarily after the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel and the biodiesel and the biogases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have this black stuff,
this solid material at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, hey, what do I do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And using it in a growing media,
is a real obvious choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they need to get the price down
a little more, or at least not rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: growers to subsidize that fraction of it
for them if they're going to be making
[SPEAKER_01]: money off the gas and the fuel from the
pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's usually how the conversation
starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a supply of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do we use this sustainably
and maybe make a little money from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen actually in Oregon,
my father was actually working with some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks down there in terms of using kilns
when they go out and do logging for the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest slash to sequester the carbon from
the forest slash and then create a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct that could be put back onto the
land or potentially sold to offset some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the costs associated with setting up
biochar kilns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, biochar is something that I think
is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is carbon positive in terms of
sequestering carbon versus the carbon loss
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would normally see with the timber
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a really good one that
you brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done some trials ourselves,
but there's actually a lot of research
[SPEAKER_00]: around biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen better plant growth by
using biochar, even as low as 5% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: media, which sort of surprised me in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I definitely think it's
something that people should consider in
[SPEAKER_00]: their substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're having a substrate conversation
like this, I didn't think to bring it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm so glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you brought up an interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny because I used to say the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar is a lot like compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to consider what was the feedstock
originally, because that will determine
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemical properties when you create
the biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it processed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like how was it composted?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it pyrolysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then were they post-treatment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-pyrolysis treatments that were
applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, all biochars are not created
equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They vary incredibly depending on what you
started from and how it was pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considering it as you would compost,
not all are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people ask, can I just go down to Home
Depot and buy some charcoal, throw that in
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times that's not pyrolysis to
the extent that we want for biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it may contain heavy metals and
other toxins because they're not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to create the same quality product that we
may want for horticulture, at least is my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go, I did want to talk about
these wood substrate alternatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it's something that I've
looked into, and I personally have not had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of success with them in terms of
creating the same level of plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to attribute that to the
media or the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say that that's on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear your thoughts around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I do want to bring up
before I let you talk about it is the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that on soil bags, the way the labeling
works around these products is you may see
[SPEAKER_00]: them listed as forest byproducts,
pine bark, pine bark fines, and a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like biochar or like compost,
that could speak to anything from high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality pine bark fines that are going to
have good results potentially in your mix
[SPEAKER_00]: to something like sawdust that's just
maybe added as a filler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very challenging as a grower to
determine what you're getting in a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: without doing a little bit more digging,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labeling doesn't give it all away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess is that the larger commercial
substrate providers are going to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: better job at guaranteeing what comes in
that bag than what you might find from
[SPEAKER_01]: like, say like a Home Depot or just going
down to the garden center and products
[SPEAKER_01]: that are, and I know this from personal
experience, products that are geared
[SPEAKER_01]: toward homeowners, they'll fill that bag
with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the manufacturers, when they're
selling it to a commercial grower that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs crop uniformity from not only within
a crop, but from year to year and crop to
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, they're much more conscious about
what they're putting in and making sure it
[SPEAKER_01]: falls within certain quality standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using a homeowner geared
product, you never know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say pine bark fines,
you kind of described that a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: our bark fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about sort of
the physical properties as well as what
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of percentages people are using them
in and what sort of results we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: in horticulture right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with pine bark and pine bark fines,
and that can mean a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we would generally look at a
particle size distribution of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're never going to get the water
holding capacity that you would find with
[SPEAKER_01]: peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter how fine you go with these
pine bark fines, peat moss is just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a little better holding water and
buffering water, the water buffering
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also believe that the, you know,
the canine exchange capacity and the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: buffering in peat is a little better than
it would be in pine bark fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, you could use 100%
pine bark to grow an outdoor nursery crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of our ideal substrate in Ohio
would be something like 80% pine bark,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% stagnant peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will grow a really good crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, then you have to add a
little bit of lime and fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the physical components of
the media, that's a great crop for an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor woody plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you go into more herbaceous
things, smaller plants, the smaller the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the more sensitive it's going to be
to the chemical and physical properties of
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where peat moss generally does a
lot better than pine bark would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But large, robust, woody plants,
we have a saying, you can put 20% of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in those pots and it's going to
grow just the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they're all that, but they're just
more robust to less ideal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates than a small floriculture crop
or perhaps, you know, cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a one or two gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my experience of pine bark and
pine bark fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes for an excellent growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary component used for nursery
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start growing, you know,
again, more herbaceous or smaller plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be a little more selective and
careful with what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that we haven't really
talked about that I just want to bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: too is sort of the, because when I think
about a substrate, and I've mentioned this
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast a lot of times,
I'm looking at a substrate from about
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like three different pillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to look at the physical
properties of that substrate, the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, where's the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of minerals is contained?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the biological properties
of that substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't talked about biology at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing with peat moss, and I can
say this just from looking down a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, is it's biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains good biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some of these other substrates
like cocoa core or pine bark fines,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have to be introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to come in with any sort of
nutrient cycling on organic side in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the biology in that substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to touch on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's actually something we've been
working on a lot for the last five to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, going back since we started using
growing media in the 1960s, studying the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology has been incredibly difficult
because you're limited to studying maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two pathogens or say beneficial
organisms like mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two things at a time, and only
things that you can plate in a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other organisms are just too difficult to
quantify or anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with the advent of DNA technologies,
say 15 or 20 years ago, and around 10 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years ago, they became very affordable
in an agricultural research sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, using DNA sequencing technology,
we're just starting to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome in growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find several papers out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say is the microbiome depends
on what you start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on day zero, they're going to be very
different in containers filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: different media or even compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after two or three months in that
growing media, under those conditions with
[SPEAKER_01]: the irrigation, the fertility,
the temperature, all of the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions that you have, that's going to
select for a certain consortia of a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what you started with,
a lot of that's going to die out because
[SPEAKER_01]: it just can't survive in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we find is if we start with different
media of different compost or different
[SPEAKER_01]: components, they tend to look the same
after about three months in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like I tell people,
if you want to increase the biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the North Pole, you took a bunch of
tigers, lions, and zebras up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: After about a week, you just have a bunch
of dead lions, tigers, and zebras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so much what you put into that
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what will the environmental factors
sustain in terms of microbial organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my colleagues here at Ohio State
University, she did something really
[SPEAKER_01]: clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was looking for beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she collected her sources from a
commercial greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those bacteria, if she found plant
growth promoting properties within those
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, they are more likely to survive
if you then apply them to other
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that program is actually working quite
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of snake oil out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers would like to buy things
because they think it's biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does that even mean in a
realistic sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever that company wants it to
mean that they're trying to sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: product to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just starting to learn now about
what actually lives in these container
[SPEAKER_01]: media and what will survive in a growing
meter versus what you apply to that media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a very young science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot less about that than we know
about the physical and the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: properties just because it's so hard to
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even now, it's still really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring pH and EC or porosity,
those things are relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a good microbial community
analysis of a growing media takes a
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated person who knows what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's somewhat difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's really interesting
about what you said regarding various
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates containing similar biological
communities after a given period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just being in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize sort of your opinion on on
microbes biology, it's that it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the industry that we're still
learning a lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive and maybe not the best tool
for making diagnostic or this data driven
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions about our cultivation habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I what I know about it is only
the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know so little about those
biological communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you looked at all the papers that
have been published to this day,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a small amount of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just we we know less than what we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's we have a lot to learn
about that before we can make any really
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusive decisions or give conclusive
advice on what you should or should not
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm talking about is based on the
scantest amount of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've observed on some of the studies
that we have done on how these communities
[SPEAKER_01]: start out and how they change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we have not done nearly enough
research on this to speak authoritatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't know enough to really
say one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I went to a talk by a soil scientist
at a college 10, 15 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things he said that really
stuck with me was he said, we know more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the surface of the moon and the
depths of our ocean than we do with what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on directly underneath our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't understand that biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also got to attend at the
International Soil Science Society of
[SPEAKER_00]: America Conference one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mouthful was a speaker that did
research doing DNA analysis on
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural lands in relation to
hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, they measured them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at all of what was in a soil,
a soil when the soil was dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came back after a rain and
measured it and then maybe after a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you saw a massive change in fungal to
bacterial ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw a huge change in the consortium
microbes that were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a complex community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I see people making decisions
about their cultivation habits based off
[SPEAKER_00]: of what they see under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm literally looking at my microscope
over here because it's something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I use a chemical analysis,
a soil test, because like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have very reliable metrics around EC,
pH, the levels of calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium that we know a particular
crop needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, those are more data driven
variables than the microbiome,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it is quite important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly my assessment of it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we just spent five years doing
studies on the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just know so little that it's
really hard to make, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: data driven decisions based on what we
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we do know that compost is
this magical tool that we have in our
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenal that we can add into soils and see
these because it is such a concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes that we see such great results
from it when used properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of identifying the microbes,
I think that is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I look forward to what research is
coming out of your university and others
[SPEAKER_00]: on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's going to be slow,
I fear, just because of the expense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, to me, it's the last frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really good at the chemical and
physical properties, but we need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better at measuring and understanding how
to, well, first of all, how to measure it
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to manage the biological
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's what growers are
really looking to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They understand the importance of the
biological component, but we just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know enough to know how to manipulate it
or how to use it to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were two substrates that I wanted
to ask you about that we didn't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of throwing you a curveball here,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of pit moss, by chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a newspaper cardboard based
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did some trials with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally wasn't able to create a
chemical analysis soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really comfortable in utilizing,
but I think it's a really fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: recycled product in terms of utilizing a
waste stream into a potential substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great story, but I have not seen
evidence yet that it's going to make an
[SPEAKER_01]: effective commercial substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you commit to doing anything with
that product, whether you or one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: audience members, do your homework and
make sure it works well in your production
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there could be some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy wash is the other one that I see at
trade shows that is another waste product
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I hold it in my hands and look
at it, it seems like it would be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: viable substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it would grow plants,
but with a high pH and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges around it, it's another one
that I haven't really had good success
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any trials or seen any
research on that as another option?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen somebody use these dairy
digestates and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look just like peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look and feel right, but again,
and I've seen several of these companies
[SPEAKER_01]: come and go, and their products come and
go, and none of them have been successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them, I should say, not the
companies, but I have not been able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: those products successfully to grow plants
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe that's because I'm a bad
horticulturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel about myself with those
too, so that makes me feel a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would tell any of your listeners,
always try new things, but do your
[SPEAKER_01]: homework and really vet them before you
consider going all in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen a lot of challenging,
they've not worked too well for most
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to summarize our conversation today,
peat moss does have an ecological impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: an environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be quite as extreme as some of
the media stories are telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these other substrate options like
Cococor, Rockwool, Perlite, all have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological impact as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar is something that could absolutely
be considered, but check your quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little research before incorporating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of these other alternatives
like the Dairy Wash, Pine Bark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pit moss all have challenges as well,
but maybe could be incorporated at smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages than, say, just completely
switching over as a media, maybe use at 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of right now, there is nothing from
a plant perspective in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate that's going to beat peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I tell growers too is
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using peat moss for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that time, we have, as we
discussed earlier, we have engineered the
[SPEAKER_01]: right particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buffer the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We amend it with starter charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have wetting agents, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very good at using peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we put 60 years of that same rigor
and research into using coir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be as good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coir is the only product, in my opinion,
that can be used in the broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could replace peat in many of the
situations where you use peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are challenges, again,
as you mentioned with the pH and the
[SPEAKER_01]: salinity sometimes and the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we put the same amount of research
in the coir, could it be as good as peat?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can replace peat?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only, in my opinion,
that's the only thing I know right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things that need to be
figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I would tell growers is it
has the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we put so much effort into refining
the use, refining stagnant peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be really hard to just start
using something or find something else and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, let's try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to work as well as peat
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've engineered that so thoroughly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really great substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
