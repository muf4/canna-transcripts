[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan is an educator, breeder, and
researcher specializing in the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetic diversity of the cannabis
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan comes from a background in
neuroscience focusing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, but later focusing
on plant breeding technologies and the
[SPEAKER_00]: study of the molecular aspects of the
cannabis genome and how we can use science
[SPEAKER_00]: to shape and improve the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners a little bit about
yourself and your background?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm a cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breeding cannabis for roughly 30
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an undergrad degree in
neuroscience and I studied plant breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: and biotechnology at a post-grad level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've really been kind of looking at
cannabis from a scientific level,
[SPEAKER_02]: more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite seriously for the last 25 plus
years, at least, and growing for about 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a fair amount of experience in
the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a seed company in Europe
called Chimera Genetics, which some people
[SPEAKER_02]: may know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I operate as a consultant and genetic
supplier to companies in North America,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, really Canada, and then globally
through our legal expert system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I first heard you speak at Emerald
Cup a few years ago now with Seth Crawford
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jeremy Plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you and Jeremy are good
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that you were the one I need
to talk to when it came to this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to admit right at the
beginning of the podcast, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: much about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I've really dived
into or have any experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just going to be an organic
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the cuff, just kind of talking about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of wanted to start with sort of
a historical aspect here in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has been bred and get into sort
of where you see it going in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a huge, interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different plants have different
breeding systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dictates a lot about what traits
persist in the genome and what traits get
[SPEAKER_02]: purged and taken out of the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is called an obligate
out-crosser, which means in nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: no plant will ever really self-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can talk about intersex plants
to a degree, and there is a certain degree
[SPEAKER_02]: of inbreeding that happens with those
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the standard kind of method for
cannabis to breed in nature is a male
[SPEAKER_02]: plant has to land on a different female
plant for progeny or for a seed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that natural state is really designed
to preserve a wide genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: within the genome because things don't get
purged out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a factor of the mating system
that traits kind of stick around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it leads to a huge variability in the
population of the species as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's kind of look at it from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when humans really got into breeding
drug cannabis, I would say seriously,
[SPEAKER_02]: mid 20th century, 60s and 70s,
people started taking plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: populations that they could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you're a grower in the late 60s,
you're probably selecting seeds out of
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian or Mexican flour that's coming
into the United States and being shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would just kind of cross those
plants with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd grow them, and the next year,
you'd collect more seeds over the bud that
[SPEAKER_02]: you were buying and smoking of plants that
were of weed that was kind of exceptional
[SPEAKER_02]: or better quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd breed that in to the plant next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this one-to-one type breeding
system is very different from the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis produces in the wild,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the wild, you get these large stands of
plants, say, well, I mean, it depends on
[SPEAKER_02]: the stand, it's the number of individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you say that there's like,
you know, somewhere between 10 and 100 or
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000 individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of having this like big
orgy where all the males are fertilizing
[SPEAKER_02]: all the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just like kind of like a big
shuffling of traits, ongoing generation
[SPEAKER_02]: after generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good because you have genetic
variability so that when those seeds move
[SPEAKER_02]: from one location to another, there's
usually enough built-in variability that
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter the new location or the
environmental conditions in the new
[SPEAKER_02]: location, there's going to be some plants
in that population that will survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of changed the script on that
in the like the 60s and the 70s when we
[SPEAKER_02]: started breeding plants one-to-one,
you know, taking one male, some grown or
[SPEAKER_02]: would say, oh, I like the structure and
the habit of this male plant and it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: good when I rub the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's cross a little bit of that
pollen to each one of our females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the next year they'd
kind of make selections from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which breeding events or breeding
experiments turned out well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not really the way that if you
were a scientist, you would start,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, measuring, you know,
if you're a scientist, you're breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat or corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every little trait is considered from pest
resistance to mold resistance to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, rate of growth, yield,
flavor of the plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a little more loosey-goosey
the way that cannabis growers have done
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that practice really took hold for,
I would say, you know, from like,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's again call it late 60s to late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the late 90s, some people started
breeding plants with a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: accuracy and scientific intention,
either measuring cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenoids and really going after
specifically changing the chemical profile
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can do it with smell by your
nose a little bit, but the real way to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that is to use like an analytical
laboratory so that you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: analyzing the chemistry or the chemicals
that are in the plant and then making
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding decisions on individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of like really,
you know, in a short summation where we've
[SPEAKER_02]: come from in the past kind of 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can I ask you a quick question here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so philosophically speaking,
from an evolutionary perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the cannabis plants
perspective, having greater genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: versity, you know, pollinating a whole
bunch of plants with a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes allows us to, you know,
allows it a better chance to survive in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone's going to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons as humans,
we have these stigmas against,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breeding with our close
relatives in every culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think of Michael Pollan's
book, you know, this idea that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of these other crops have sort of
enslaved humans to look for these traits
[SPEAKER_00]: in their own survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so now I look at cannabis as
having as a plant sort of used humans as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way because of the effect that it gives to
breed for, you know, more specific traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it may be more evolutionary
advantageous to produce higher THC because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the effects it has or higher
cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that I mean, I know I'm kind of
rambling here, but does that make make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense or is that sort of something from a
philosophical perspective or evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective for the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I tried not to answer Primorify's
plan too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, you know, all organisms on the
planet are just different forms of DNA and
[SPEAKER_02]: different expressions of DNA trying to
replicate itself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so an organism could be said to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is one perspective,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: An organism could be said to be successful
as it reproduces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from that perspective, anything
that a plant can do to increase its
[SPEAKER_02]: chances to reproduce, to have more progeny
and go on, you know, in an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_02]: context is a win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think the plant really cares
what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just these traits come along or they
evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we as humans come in and we start
reinforcing those traits because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, look, the plant that we
found when humanity came in contact with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis was nothing like the plant that
it came today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a small little kind of weedy plant
that followed camps around because we
[SPEAKER_02]: would, you know, eat the seeds and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably produced very little
cannabinoids and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot less terpenoids and volatile smell
molecules than it produces now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over generations and generations and
generations of humans growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, let's call it, you know,
over the last, it's hard to put a time
[SPEAKER_02]: scale on it, but say 10,000 years at
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've changed the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've selected for things in the plants or
individuals that we would find in the
[SPEAKER_02]: population of plants that might suit our
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for fiber, we, for example,
we took plants and used them to make
[SPEAKER_02]: cordage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ropes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so plants that had long fibers,
which is a result of like large internode
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces, you know, that was a useful trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we changed, we essentially changed
these plants over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made a really good point when you,
when you mentioned humans and how humans,
[SPEAKER_02]: humans breed, humans are also obligate
out-crossers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can't have offspring without
mating with an individual of the opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so very much like cannabis,
our mating system is the same kind of way
[SPEAKER_02]: it's designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at humanity across the globe,
there's this huge amount of genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: variation, not only in skin and eye color
and hair color, but every conceivable
[SPEAKER_02]: trait, there's variation present in the
species.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Length of fingers, even number of fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have these like polydacty
people that have like six fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's all these little weird
mutations that can exist in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in the species, but we don't,
as humans go in and actively breed for
[SPEAKER_02]: those traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, like you said, we don't
breed tightly within our family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've learned probably through
experimentation in the past that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when you have kids with someone
that's closely related to your family,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's problems that arise and
you can point to any of the royal families
[SPEAKER_02]: that have existed around the world over
the last, you know, a few hundred years as
[SPEAKER_02]: an example of like, you know, there's like
a Spanish royal that they essentially bred
[SPEAKER_02]: the line within, within a given family to
the point of sterility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this also happens with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, you start, um, taking these very
unnatural breeding programs and you self a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, you know, say over five
generations, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really narrow down the gene pool and
you start uncovering a lot of the negative
[SPEAKER_02]: deleterious traits that are buried within
the, within any given individual's genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, these are, you know, these are the
consequences of things that we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about on a very top level when we're
going about, about our breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of people,
they come into the cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: world, they come from being growers and
then they want to start to make their own
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, is that as much as there
is an art involved in selecting plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: mating them together, there also is a
science and a math behind the art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to be truly the most effective that
you can be, you combine that art and
[SPEAKER_02]: passion and love for the plants and
knowledge about, you know, that you
[SPEAKER_02]: acquire about plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing, you know, a species over say 10,
15 years or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you add in that level of science
and math and plant breeding understanding,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can really make some quite significant
gains, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to what we're doing today,
uh, on, on the whole, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to decide if I want to
talk a little bit then about what your
[SPEAKER_00]: selection process is, because I realize
you have to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: For, you know, maybe a single trade or a
small group of traits at any given time,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's powdery mildew resistance
or it's, uh, you know, more vigorous root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or a particular terpene expression
or cannabinoid content or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's sort of the thought process
behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's, it's really no
different than I think the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody looks at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the only difference is,
you know, there's, look, there's every
[SPEAKER_02]: time you breed a plant, there's a cost,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cost in terms of you're
selecting one plant over another,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's also like material costs to
grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're doing either genomic or
chemical analysis, those are like extra
[SPEAKER_02]: costs that start to add up like really,
really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you say, you know, I know in
California last few years, you can get a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid in a, in a rudimentary terpene
test done for like roughly a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you grow, if you're growing a
hundred individuals from a seed line and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to really understand what's
happening in the population and select for
[SPEAKER_02]: rare plants, that's a $10,000 bill,
like a hundred times a hundred bucks,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred individuals, 10, a hundred bucks
per test.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a $10,000 analytical chemistry bill
just from the lab for that one crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we haven't even talked about
genomic selection or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's really about balancing the money
that you have to spend on doing the R and
[SPEAKER_02]: D with the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're entering this world now
where, you know, obviously there's these
[SPEAKER_02]: public publicly traded companies and,
and, and companies that have been invested
[SPEAKER_02]: in by even private individuals that have
pretty significant budgets that
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, Hey, if you're going to do,
you know, when you do research,
[SPEAKER_02]: research and development, yeah,
it, it, there is a cost, but at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the research and development, you,
you should end up with something better,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a product that's better in the end
from which you can then make up those
[SPEAKER_02]: costs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those added costs that you took on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so this is kind of like the debate
between, you know, the small farmer home
[SPEAKER_02]: grower versus more of a corporate style of
breeding, which is funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, you know, I've had the pleasure,
but I've had the ability to do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I got to tell you after building a
really high throughput lab with really
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive, um, analytical equipment,
once you've done it that way, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: would have a hard time going back to doing
it the other way without all that chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis, because the gains that you can
make when you're analyzing plants and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and looking at them, not only from like
the passionate perspective that we all
[SPEAKER_02]: have as growers of, you know, 20 plus
years, you also get all this nerd data
[SPEAKER_02]: that tells you about like, you know,
the quant, the cannabinoid content or
[SPEAKER_02]: profile or the terpene content and
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That influences smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really hard to go back to
less data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you have a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, what I'm hearing is to a
certain extent that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the small breeder, small farmers are just
at a huge disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is, is it almost becoming a
lottery ticket to a certain extent in that
[SPEAKER_00]: case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would, I would say the smaller
farmers that are doing it without that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of funding and without that kind of
chemical analysis, it is a lottery,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really are counting on luck and your
ability as a grower or a selector to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through a population and find plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to miss like, I'll just,
you know, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do it that way, you're going to
miss things in the, in the mix,
[SPEAKER_02]: because for example, it's really hard to,
you know, by organoleptics, like for
[SPEAKER_02]: example, tasting every plant and smoking
every plant, it's really hard to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: not only the differences in, in like that
top tier cannabinoid production plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also like, it's like near impossible
to find a plant that has CBD or THCV or
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDV, for example, some of these more rare
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, because those things are not,
they don't have a psychoactive impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: the, on the, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psychoactive can be a problem,
problematic word.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those compounds don't produce a high,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to quantify them or
even qualify plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, you know, you can't pick out a plant
that has THCV or CBDV by smoking it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I would say in that, in that sense,
they are at a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the people that put the
money into analytics be, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: either be a chemical analysis or genomic
analysis, they definitely have an
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've got a leg up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So following that line of thought,
like where do you see the industry headed
[SPEAKER_00]: as we get federal legalization here in the
United States, as more states come online
[SPEAKER_00]: and more of these big egg companies get
into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are we going to end up,
is it going to be like when you order corn
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to lose genetic diversity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I would argue that we're
already losing genetic diversity because,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have been for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even like say the last 15 years,
since the, you know, the occurrence of
[SPEAKER_02]: like OG and these, these cushy plants,
I guess we're closer to 20 years at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flavor profile, like, you know,
if you, if you do a chemical analytical
[SPEAKER_02]: survey of the plants on the market,
the vast majority of plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-cariophylline, nersine, limonene
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's the cushy market
profile, that cushy market profile that
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody wants that gassy nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is a very small subset of the plants that
cannabis can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already are going towards a smaller
genetic diversity by consumer choices.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't know that big ag is going
to be, I mean, look, if for these big pot
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that we see that are building
right now, these MSOs, the multi-state
[SPEAKER_02]: operators, like Curely, Leaf and Treeleaf,
once a company becomes like a public
[SPEAKER_02]: company, it's really, their only goal is
to make more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the stock to go up for their
investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those types of companies are not
really too, too keen to put like millions
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars into a breeding program because
it's a cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cost center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's always going to just
be costing you money all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I just say, could one argue too,
that consumer, the consumer driven markets
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense that people always are
chasing the next hype strain or cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: will keep things somewhat fresh and keep
maybe smaller breeders in the running for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genetics down the road or?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, I think that there's always
going to, well, I think that the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: will be done by smaller companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are smaller groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to be,
you know, these small farms are really
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be leading the way because like I
said, it's quite hard to compete against
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that are bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for example, I mean,
one of the companies I've worked for down
[SPEAKER_02]: in California, we had a client that we did
some breeding for and they actually ended
[SPEAKER_02]: up winning the Emerald Cup with a cultivar
called Lemon Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that year, the Lemon Crush,
like, you know, we used a lab to obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: to guide our selection process and our
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Lemon Crush plant beat the
competitors by like a really significant
[SPEAKER_02]: amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the people that, you know,
all the judges of Emerald Cup were really
[SPEAKER_02]: quite unanimously blown away by this one
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it had like,
you know, it was like 30 to 40% or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it was 20 to 30% more votes than any other
plant in the competition, which is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really quite significant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a close margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that we'll probably see less
people breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there'll be more people playing
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flip side to the coin is, is that,
you know, this market driven approach that
[SPEAKER_02]: always depends something new is a little
bit fickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a little bit fickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fickle to the point where it's
kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the market wants something
new every six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't breed plants that fast to be
finding new plants that quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That are truly better plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that like the market hype side
that we have has kind of accelerated to
[SPEAKER_02]: the point where it's like, it's ridiculous
at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people need to, you know, I just don't
think fashions need to change that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, when you look at these plants,
chemically, the names change, but
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically, the plants aren't changing
that much, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the plant that was popular six months
ago, or eight months ago, is really no
[SPEAKER_02]: different chemically than the plant that
is popular today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has a new fancy name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I think of other crops like
tomatoes, you know, I'll see a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: new varieties maybe come out in a given
year, but everyone's going back,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I know I have my favorites
that I order every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run a Sakura red cherry tomato,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the fact that I know exactly
what I'm going to get as a gardener and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can order those seeds and they're
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see something more like a
traditional crop experience for gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the way we currently get a lot of our
vegetable seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, like, okay, so tomato is a
really interesting example because tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of the opposite breeding system of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an obligated crosser.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's called a selfing species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So selfers, once they've been bred and
purged out, like the negative genes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which tomato has done over really the last
call it few thousand years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, when you grow it,
if you buy an heirloom tomato seed and you
[SPEAKER_02]: save the seeds and you, you know,
you're off the, but like whatever the
[SPEAKER_02]: material is that surrounds the seeds,
you kind of have to decompose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the seed is able to germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you plant those seeds the next year and
you harvest the tomato from the second
[SPEAKER_02]: generation, they look almost identical and
taste almost identical to the tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've got from the year before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they all look identical to the,
their cohorts in the, in the population,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the brothers and sisters come up
looking the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, again, breed it again,
another generation or on for like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, say 20 generations, those seeds
look there, the fruit look and taste the
[SPEAKER_02]: same in the 20th generation as they did in
the first generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen with cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, it's an obligate out
crosser, just like you have, you have
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers and sisters or the audience
members that have brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know, aside from twins, that your
brothers and sisters might share traits
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have, but they don't look
identical to you, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't think that like,
I think really once we have full
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in multiple markets across
the world, I really don't think that there
[SPEAKER_02]: will be much of a seed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the majority of people that are
growing from growing will grow from clone
[SPEAKER_02]: or tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we get to that point,
call it 10, 15 years down the road,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you actually have breeding companies
that put in the time and the work to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, crops that are plantable from seed and
uniform chemically that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in the, the corn analogy that we're
giving before where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you talk, if you have like, you know,
you want to plant an acre or 10 acres of
[SPEAKER_02]: corn, you can go out and buy corn seed and
they all come up and they grow the same
[SPEAKER_02]: height and they have the same number of
years per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all like what I call
bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all resistant to pests and
diseases, drought, and they all have high
[SPEAKER_02]: yields and they all look the same,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually we will get there with
cannabis, but I really don't think that
[SPEAKER_02]: that type of breeding is going to be done
by people on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be done by companies that
put work into, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they put resources into genetic analysis
and chemical analysis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they truly create uniform plants
using like more, let's just say more
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced breeding technologies,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we at risk of roundup ready seeds,
hemp seeds or cannabis seeds down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as we have the strict,
the stringent chemical controls that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have on the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you're in Washington,
so you guys have like a pretty strict
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a federally regulated system and
it's very clear that you can't have more
[SPEAKER_02]: than a specific number of parts per
billion of any given chemical pesticide,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really you don't want to be using
chemicals on your plants because there
[SPEAKER_02]: ends up being a trace or like even a
disqualification of your crop if the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical burden is too high, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really don't see roundup ready being
a thing in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, it's like you'd end up with all
this roundup in the final extract or
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and that's just, that's not
allowed by the regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think that the regulations
kind of protect us from a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: bad, not that they're bad practices,
but they're necessary practices to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to do, again, like 10,000 acres
of corn, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in Iowa or somewhere in the
Midwest and your neighbors are all growing
[SPEAKER_02]: either soy or corn or whatever it is,
everybody's grown the same crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so pests can come in and just destroy
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you end up using these,
you know, agrochemicals to essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: protect the crop from either weeds or
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know your talk or your panel,
this was like probably four years ago now,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe five years ago at Emerald Cup,
was about CRISPR and talking about gene
[SPEAKER_00]: editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of concern from,
and GMOs, and there was a lot of concern
[SPEAKER_00]: from the organic folks in the audience of
GMO cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, if anything, has changed in the last
few years on that or what are your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I come from like the opposite end
of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, I'm pretty hippie
minded and the environment is a big deal
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, I also studied, like,
like I said, I studied plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: biotechnology at a post-grad level in
university.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, like, I have a pretty good grasp of,
like, you know, genetic mutation and how
[SPEAKER_02]: genomes change over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, you know, like, for example,
like there's viruses and bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: change plants, that they create
genetically modified plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the species that we work with
or we use as ag crops have undergone these
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic transformations naturally in the
wild, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, I'm not a religious
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe in like, I don't really
believe in the concept of there's a God
[SPEAKER_02]: making all these decisions for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people start talking about like,
it's not the way nature intended,
[SPEAKER_02]: like nature does all these things and we
harvested these tools for genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: modification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're at the point now where we can,
you know, we can very specifically change
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic bases in plants to make those
plants have traits that we, that the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: might not have, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, anyway, my point is, I'm a little
bit biased and I think that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people would probably disagree with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that when you get to the point
where you really understand that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis genomes or genomes in
general are always in flux, they're always
[SPEAKER_02]: changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so humans using CRISPR or similar
technologies to go in and very
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically and precisely edit base pairs
to induce changes is not that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not only not dangerous, it's going to
be the only thing that's going to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: humanity to survive the next few hundred
years with this insane global climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change situation that we've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have mass famines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have areas, geographic
areas that were crop production areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to become destroyed by the
changing environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have to adapt plants to
regions that they weren't able to grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: like really damn quickly if we're going to
have any shot at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can't do that through
conventional breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to really use all the
technologies that we have learned about to
[SPEAKER_02]: get to that point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll probably upset some of your
listeners, but that's my perspective on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do see this as being the future
with cannabis, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen, for me, it's not an inevitably
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for me, technologies are tools,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I gave this analogy
on the show a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having a golf game, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're out on the golf, you don't just
take your driver out every time you need
[SPEAKER_02]: to hit the ball and smack it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn to have a toolbox of shots that
you can pull out at the time when you need
[SPEAKER_02]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So not everything is a crisper solution,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you need to make a crisper
modification to induce a trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then from that point on, you just
classically breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use classical Mendelian breeding
techniques to shuffle that trade around,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, there's genetic modifications
that you can do to plants that don't ever
[SPEAKER_02]: end up passed on into the offspring,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that you would use for
a seed production technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of ways to use these
words like crisper, these technologies
[SPEAKER_02]: like crisper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's like a lot of the
anti-gene, GMO kind of ethos comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: people that don't really understand the
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think once you start to understand
the science and the way that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: genomes are in flux already, that like
these things don't become too much of a
[SPEAKER_02]: big deal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I know this is totally off
the cuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't a topic we planned on talking
about, but for me, as someone who falls on
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic side of things, and you're
right, I don't totally understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be the first to admit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern is more the corruption of these
major agrochemical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that they have our best
interest in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that their bottom line is
going to supersede our health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like our government to a
certain extent is willing to push these
[SPEAKER_00]: things through through lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my concern is that even if the
technology is okay, there may be uses of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that could be dangerous for human
health down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we talk about Roundup,
for example, and Roundup Ready crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is more and more research that maybe
this wasn't as safe as we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been used to bankrupt a lot of
Indian farmers in terms of their inability
[SPEAKER_00]: to afford the seed and litigation around
drift of pollen and things into other
[SPEAKER_00]: organic crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's become a little bit of a
contentious issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's sort of my perspective
on it, because you're right, I absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand all the science behind
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chad, that's totally a fair perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't disagree with you there at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's like to me,
it's like nuclear technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can build safe, clean thorium reactors
that can safely produce nuclear energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we can take plutonium and make bombs
out of it or hydrogen bombs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like let's not confuse the tool
or the technology with the use of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tool, right by unscrupulous people with
unscrupulous agendas, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's always going to be people
that take the technology and they try to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop it for their own financial
interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean that you should
throw the technology out because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: also use technology to benefit humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, the points
that you're making are very fair,
[SPEAKER_02]: given the track records of the companies
that have developed these technologies,
[SPEAKER_02]: i.e., you know, Monsanto and the Roundup
Ready thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made these plants resistance to a
chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people don't realize
that Monsanto was a chemical company,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They made chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what they did before they got
into plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they developed, then they found
this gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole company business switched
because they found this gene they could
[SPEAKER_02]: put into plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a patent on that gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That genetic construct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really gave them the ability to
switch into this kind of life sciences
[SPEAKER_02]: company, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or big ag company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only goal was to make these
resistant plants so they could sell more
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I think people should
understand again, it is a fine discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we have to separate the
technologies from the technology and the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential good uses from bad actors using
those technologies for their own profit,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't just throw away the baby
with the bathwater because there's people
[SPEAKER_02]: doing bad stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These technologies really can change the
way that agriculture is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make better, more resistant,
healthier, more nutritious plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have technologies do those
things, I think that we should be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: those things to make our ecological
footprint on the planet lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need some of these technologies
just to survive as a species down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I can very well see that
being the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether I like it or not, it's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the aspect of it that I
think I have to be cognizant of is it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really matter what my opinion is
on it at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be people out there that
are going to do it, whether I like it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can it be done in a safe way that
protects consumers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the science has shown at
this point in time that it really can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we have, I'm not sure what
the process is in the States, but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty sure that the EPA must have some
say about the release of genetically
[SPEAKER_02]: modified crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in Canada, you can't just take
a genetically modified organism and
[SPEAKER_02]: release it to the environment without like
millions of dollars worth of studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is like a big regulatory pushback
on a lot of these technologies where you
[SPEAKER_02]: really do have to demonstrate that the
plants are safe.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want to change directions on
this a little bit in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I see a lot of breeding
happening for, you know, the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there much breeding being done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know there's some, but where do
you see this going in terms of identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: specific compounds or effects for a more
medical nature, like around anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, anti-nausea or some of these
other benefits that people are seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get more consistency there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, through breeding and product
development, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's kind of those two aspects go
hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that with the company
that I've worked for in the States,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were, they owned a series of
dispensaries or one of their affiliate
[SPEAKER_02]: companies owned a series of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the R and D was really designed to
create products that could end up in those
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries or could end up benefiting,
you know, benefiting patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did a whole series of breeding
programs using like THCV and CBDV and CBG
[SPEAKER_02]: to like up-regulate those compounds and
create new cannabinoid profiles that might
[SPEAKER_02]: have some therapeutic advantage,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think epilepsy is like one,
one area where I think we made some decent
[SPEAKER_02]: gains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might not know that the CBDV
compound is very much like CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's got a shorter little chain on the
side of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: That compound is more effective for
epilepsy than CBD is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had bred a line that had
elevated levels of CBDV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at the time we were doing
all this work where we were pairing
[SPEAKER_02]: specific cannabinoid profiles with various
terpene profiles, kind of to like optimize
[SPEAKER_02]: the entourage effect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the concept of an entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked into the literature and
started looking, figuring out,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out what terpenes and
terpenoids had antispasmodic or
[SPEAKER_02]: anticonvulsant properties and realized
that both beta-cariophylline and linalool
[SPEAKER_02]: each have some of those properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started hybridizing our CBDV line
into a plant that were high in
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-cariophylline and linalool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a couple of generations of
shuffling, we ended up with plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: were essentially CBDV dominant and had
terpene profiles that were dominant in
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-cariophylline and linalool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is that you've now got a
plant that not only has a cannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_02]: is directed towards, you know,
epilepsy or reducing seizures,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all the compounds, sorry, the other
major compounds that are in the plant also
[SPEAKER_02]: have anticonvulsive or antispasmodic
properties, with the idea being that these
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers could then be given to people that
have these conditions or you would use
[SPEAKER_02]: those to make extracts, right,
that are more suited to giving to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, kids, for example,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want like four-year-olds to have
to be smoking big fat joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's better to give them an extract
that they can take orally, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone listening that may be dealing
with these sort of medical issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any recommendations where
people might be able to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or reach out to companies that
may be able to point them in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately, that's the corporate
trade-off side to this whole thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like these companies that develop
that kind of intellectual property,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't just give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can you buy the seeds even though,
or can you buy the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what the status of the
products are in their dispensaries these
[SPEAKER_02]: days, because again, I've been gone from
that company for five years at this point
[SPEAKER_02]: in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I don't really know what the
status of their availability is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they filed some patents,
and I think that their business model was
[SPEAKER_02]: more about trying to find other businesses
to license the technology to and license
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants to rather than give them out
to patients, which is a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's kind of the way that
things are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you're spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars or even millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars building these labs and running
breeding programs to fill, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking like tens of thousands of
samples going to the lab, that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: hefty bill, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lab bill, and they obviously want to
recoup a return on their investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So handing out seeds to some growers and
humble that are going to multiply them and
[SPEAKER_02]: hand them out for free isn't really part
of their business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just curious if they were even
selling clones or offering the final,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, end product in a form that
people can purchase if that was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I mean, at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we're still stumbling out of
fucking prohibition, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, give it like,
let's call it 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty far out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even 15 to 20 years after
legalization, people are going to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the United States and Canada as
well will have really good systems for
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting the ownership of plants for
breeders that actually develop any plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be able to register it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things, when they're propagated
or sold through nurseries, the breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: will get, you know, little bits of
royalty, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They come back to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as those systems develop, I think that
we'll see a much more robust legal clone
[SPEAKER_02]: sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so that growers don't have to buy
seeds and search through to find winter
[SPEAKER_02]: winter plants, like you'll be able to go
in to any nursery and select from probably
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 100 to 300 different genetic
types, right, that have been selected for
[SPEAKER_02]: either specific cannabinoid profile or
specific terpene profile or flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you talking about culture now at
this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not be the plants that you buy
might not be from tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: but hopefully the moms went through tissue
culture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of these systems that we use
in cannabis, including nurseries,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I think growing plants, mother plants
not using tissue culture, those days are
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much done, or they're, you know,
we're seeing the beginning of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: the extinction of that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think mother plants should be fed from
tissue culture, they should be certified,
[SPEAKER_02]: passed in virus and viroid free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those clones get turned into
moms, like, you know, and mothers are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably going to be replaced,
like mother plants will be replaced either
[SPEAKER_02]: every three or six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you wouldn't run them that much
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're constantly constantly reproducing
your mother stock with new tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: plants of that same genetic type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just helps me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for growers with mother plants from a
genetic perspective, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're what's best practice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some people that will keep a
mother plant for, let's say, six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have others that will every crop
start a new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they take more cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am aware that mutations can be more
likely to occur due to plant stress of any
[SPEAKER_00]: type, which could affect your next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in theory, you know, your clone is a
clone of the prior plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the what would be best practice
or what are the risks associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: either model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think one of the risks with tissue
culture is, again, just to say not all
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture labs are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of tissue culture labs use hormones
to ramp up multiplication rates or plant
[SPEAKER_02]: growth rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those same hormones that that have all
those properties that are beneficial for
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture, like, for example,
phydiazirone, one of the one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: negative traits with that one,
which is very often used in Canada's
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture, is that it increases the
mutation rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is the opportunity that your
plant is going to change genetically as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of going through the process and
good tissue culture companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: they monitor the, you know, the genetic
stability of plants going through culture
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that they're not creating a
whole bunch of off types.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this stuff also happens in
outside of the tissue culture lab to
[SPEAKER_02]: plants undergo natural mutation rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: All eukaryotic organisms have a natural
rate of mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I like to use the pinot noir,
pinot gris, pinot blanc, example,
[SPEAKER_02]: pinot gris and pinot blanc are just,
they're, they're white and pink grapes
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually derives, they're actually
cloned copies of pinot noir, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: purple grape, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that through natural mutation of
cells dividing, some clump of cells lost
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to produce that purple
pigment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore the grapes on that branch
grew white, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody was walking through a
vineyard at some point in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably harvesting the grapes and
realized that this one branch of a vine
[SPEAKER_02]: had a, had a, a white grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they, they took that branch off and
cloned it and, you know, started making
[SPEAKER_02]: mother earth, started that plant to be
more or less a mother donor plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: propagated a whole army of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point anyway, the point is,
is that like mutations are a natural part
[SPEAKER_02]: of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They happen anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I think that like,
you know, if you think about all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: negative stuff that can happen when you're
just using mother plants, like obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: the huge pest burden and viruses and
biroids like we've seen with the hoplite
[SPEAKER_02]: and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not maintaining like really good
sterility practices and like making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't cut more than one plant
with the same razor blade or scissors or
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, pruning shears or
whatever, that's how those viruses and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroids are passed around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think that there's obviously
benefits to be with tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring the health of your tissue
culture plants with molecular biology
[SPEAKER_02]: tools to make sure that you are virus
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge benefit to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that model is probably
going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think it's already starting to
change in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people will be buying plants that
came from, they're either tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or more likely the tissue culture
plants we're feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the tissue culture process was
feeding mother rooms, which were then
[SPEAKER_02]: being propagated for say three to six
months to make clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that whole process just starts
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a seed producer, you don't see that
as a viable industry down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think everyone's moving to tissue
culture and cloning?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we already, already are moving to
tissue culture now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, it depends on the crop,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing CBD distillate,
it doesn't matter if the plants all look
[SPEAKER_02]: the same or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be better if they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that you're going to
spend the money to buy tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to plant in a field when like cheap
hemp seeds that all produce CBD anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: are just being co-extracted to make a CBD
distillate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for different parts of the market,
like different strategies will prevail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that like flower producers
will probably have mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go through phases, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the current next phase is going to be
tissue culture and then call it 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, 20 years down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once real breeders have really had a
chance to like get into towards
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilizing lines, then we'll probably see
crops being planted from seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, but until we get the level of
uniformity that you can expect from a
[SPEAKER_02]: clone crop, I don't think that we'll end
up seeing flower crops grown from seed
[SPEAKER_02]: until we have that like level of breeding.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the price of seeds will have to come
down too, I would think as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, like, you know,
Monsanto, you know, you're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: like, depending on the seed and the seed
supply, you're looking at like 15 to 25%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the revenue from the crop goes back to
the seed supplier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that they play,
they pay that amount is that, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer knows that they've got a
bulletproof crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're growing 100 acres of
corn, and 25% is going to go to the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: supplier or 25% of costs are going to go
to the seed supplier, you'll just plant an
[SPEAKER_02]: extra 25 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're planting corn,
it's really not that much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got one of those, you know,
GPS guided John Deere tractors that you
[SPEAKER_02]: just essentially plug the data into an
iPad and it goes and does the work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there will be like a premium
cost for premium seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually those things are scaled to
make sense in, you know, they're scaled to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sense to the operator.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, provided the government's still
subsidizing corn and all that other
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to get in industrial lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying there's a value there for
the farmer that would still allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: higher seed prices, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a better way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quick, what about, what about this
idea of genetic drift or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic degradation of clones over time,
beyond, you know, stress or random
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we really looking at there being any
issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've also heard people say,
oh, you just need to take your indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and grow it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that sort of restores the vigor
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of touch on those those
topics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So genetic drift is like the wrong word to
use to describe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that everybody in the cannabis
industry or a lot of people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis usually use that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetic drift really means like a change
in the genetic frequencies of a population
[SPEAKER_02]: from one generation to the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really the definition of
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard what you're talking about use
that word you're talking about or the
[SPEAKER_02]: concept that you're talking about be
described by clonal drift, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, somatic mutations building
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a research paper that came out
in the last couple of months that showed,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it purported to show huge levels of
genetic mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually they took a mother plant
from a Canadian facility and it was this
[SPEAKER_02]: big, unhealthy mom that had been grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, you know, well over a year and they
took clones from the top of the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: they took clones from the bottom of the
plant and they took clones from the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant and they sequenced those
clones all individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the research their paper showed that
there was all these accumulating mutations
[SPEAKER_02]: in in mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was actually some flaws in
their data because like it just it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: ring true to me that there would be that
degree of mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown I've had plants in my library
that I've had for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know approaching 30 years and they
haven't changed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they I tell you they look and taste
and smell and grow the same way they did
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I selected them from their
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just those two pieces of data just
don't go together with me if we're having
[SPEAKER_02]: this huge rate of selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another genomics company out of
Boston that was that's been doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: work in cannabis and he said that he
thinks there's some flaws in the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point is is I don't think we have a
conclusive answer to the question you're
[SPEAKER_02]: the question you're answering but it is
important to know that all plant species
[SPEAKER_02]: and even animal species like you know
you've got as your skin cells are dividing
[SPEAKER_02]: look down at your wrist or your hand you
know the skin around those wrists it might
[SPEAKER_02]: get a mutation genetic mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In humans a genetic mutation in your skin
cells is never going to get passed on
[SPEAKER_02]: there you know especially if it's in your
hand that has no way of getting passed on
[SPEAKER_02]: to your offspring, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But plants especially cannabis don't
really operate that way like a plant if a
[SPEAKER_02]: branch has a genetic mutation that say
destroys a THC gene or a pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance gene or even a terpene flavor
gene that can be passed on if that branch
[SPEAKER_02]: is then cut and used to make a mother
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially there are some level of
just natural mutations that occur but
[SPEAKER_00]: stress plant stress can lead to more
mutations so it's very important to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy mothers and clone off of healthy
plants short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that does that kind of summarize?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah more or less like when people say
like stress causes mutations I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: that we necessarily know that to be true
but for example you know well I mean what
[SPEAKER_02]: do you define a stress change in pH like
high temperatures you know like definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: like pests or vectors for viruses and
stuff and viruses cause genetic changes or
[SPEAKER_02]: can cause some changes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that like the in theory the
practice is true I don't know that like
[SPEAKER_02]: what I don't think we really know what
stresses induce mutations because we just
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't really done those kinds of studies
in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure I was just thinking environmental
stress whether that's pest, cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, water you know this idea of cloning
off of a unhealthy plant you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to have mutations is that I mean
and maybe I'm wrong like I said this is
[SPEAKER_00]: not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mutations is probably not the best word
there I think that the concept that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about is called epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And epigenetics just means like epi means
above so it's like a level of genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation that happens above or on top of
the genetic level and it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: called DNA methylation that happens on the
genome and it really like you can think of
[SPEAKER_02]: it like you know DNA comes in like these
big bundled up coils and we have these
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins that regulate that winding or the
compression of the DNA so that it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: coiled up and is efficient to package
right and then when genes need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: transcribed machinery will come along and
unravel that piece of the genome so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the DNA can be read and so DNA when it's
coiled can have these little methylation
[SPEAKER_02]: sites added to it which tell the machinery
you know transcribe this gene more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: right and those things are actually
heritable or they can be heritable but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not actually a genetic change it's a
change is it a change in like a more
[SPEAKER_00]: deleterious expression of the genetic of
the genetics sometimes but sometimes it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be beneficial okay right so yeah
it's hard to make those kind of those like
[SPEAKER_02]: hard and fast rules about genetics right
like you know for example somebody was
[SPEAKER_02]: saying the other day like all genetic
mutations are negative well shit if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're trying to find a plant that has
cbg in it you want to plant that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: broken or mutated thc gene so that that
thc gene can't turn the cbg precursor into
[SPEAKER_02]: thc right and when you have that mutation
what happens is cbg backs up right and so
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we want to destroy a gene right
like for example there's another way we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about powdery mildew earlier on
they've just showed this genetic sequence
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have a susceptibility gene to
powdery mildew so if you have this gene
[SPEAKER_02]: then the plant is more susceptible to
powdery mildew infection it's like has to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with like a docking protein of how
powdery mildew like actually attaches to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and so if you can break that
gene in the plant you kind of destroy the
[SPEAKER_02]: docking mechanism and it makes it so in
that in that example destroying a gene
[SPEAKER_02]: makes the plant more resistant to powdery
mildew right and so this idea that like
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah there's people got to kind of get rid
of the idea that like broken genes are bad
[SPEAKER_02]: things because sometimes a broken gene
might have a phenotype that we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: like right that is beneficial for us as
humans right are you referencing the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: from Dewey scientific they came out a
while ago because I actually had someone
[SPEAKER_00]: on the podcast recently and Jordan Zager
talking about a paper directly relating to
[SPEAKER_02]: the that powdery mildew gene no this is so
that's the other side of the equation so
[SPEAKER_02]: there's they found two genes in powdery
mildew one group in Canada found this s
[SPEAKER_02]: gene which is the susceptibility gene and
then this s group working with Dewey out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Washington they found a resistance gene
and so it's just like there's two those so
[SPEAKER_02]: those are like two separate independent
genetic factors one that causes resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: the other and so you want the resistance
gene but the other gene causes
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptibility and you don't want that
gene right so you can stack the R gene
[SPEAKER_02]: with the broken s gene then you're you're
kind of off to the races right yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a better position yeah I want to
come back to this idea of taking a long
[SPEAKER_00]: cloned plant and growing it outdoors is
some way of restoring vigor to it have you
[SPEAKER_02]: heard this yeah we've seen it we've done
it and actually to a degree it works right
[SPEAKER_02]: like I think what happens is a lot of
times people have these plants in these
[SPEAKER_02]: libraries and they really grow it in them
like you said past they got pests or low
[SPEAKER_02]: light conditions or whatever and there
seems to be some thing about putting these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants out in the intense of the summer
allows that plant to like get back to
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional health I don't think there's I
don't again I don't think there's been any
[SPEAKER_02]: studies in cannabis but it might be that
like you know intense real fun is able to
[SPEAKER_02]: rip some of that methylation off the DNA
again that's just pure speculation but
[SPEAKER_02]: there is definitely something going on
with certain plants that like whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil or being held in these compact
root systems or it's the light or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like all those things over a year you know
when you take that plant back out put it
[SPEAKER_02]: back outside of nature where it evolved it
needs to bump back into optimal health
[SPEAKER_00]: right that's really interesting so there
is something potentially to that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesize but we don't have the research
yet to really identify exactly what that
[SPEAKER_02]: might be yeah I've seen plants go from
like weird kind of fucked up like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: not dotted in the thyroid sense but like
just not performing very well and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: take them outside and you put them in the
sun and they like kind of kick back into
[SPEAKER_02]: into health so I don't I don't know what
it is and I don't think that's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution to every problem but it does seem
to work on some plants that are suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit for some reason right yeah
fascinating well we've been talking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while now is there anything else you'd
like to share with listeners before we end
[SPEAKER_00]: the call I know we kind of jumped around
quite a bit now just keep growing seed I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean I you know I think people should
always be doing seeds even if it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like a few you know in their gardens you
can't find anything new we can't ever move
[SPEAKER_02]: the species forward unless we're making
seeds right and growing seeds so don't
[SPEAKER_02]: ever stop growing seeds it might have to
be like a small little patch that you do
[SPEAKER_02]: on the side just to keep things normal but
yeah I'd like to see us getting back into
[SPEAKER_02]: growing more seeds because and I think we
are as we see legalization coming you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see more people like in California like
you know five-ish years ago they were
[SPEAKER_02]: there was really this like seed growing
like explosion right and people stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: really leaning on clones much clones are
fine great uniformity and you can do all
[SPEAKER_02]: these interesting things when you have you
know a ton of biomass to make like
[SPEAKER_02]: specific flavor profile extracts but
you're never gonna find that next profile
[SPEAKER_02]: without going back to feed so I you know I
always like when people grow speed so even
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the disadvantages for that small
home grower that wants to play around with
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding you'd still encourage them to do
it because at the end of day they might
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with something really novel and
exciting or that works really well for
[SPEAKER_02]: them yeah well it's just you know it's
like listen they might not fly and create
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect plant but it's like you've
probably seen this freak show plant right
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant with the weird serrations the
leaves kind of look like burns yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like that was stumbled across by a small
home grower and it might turn out that
[SPEAKER_02]: that trait has some kind of advantage
right like you that maybe maybe that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is less susceptible to powdery mildew
again because like you know the powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew just can't grow across the leaf
like it would normally or maybe it allows
[SPEAKER_02]: more air through the leaf right and so I
again it's like it doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are discovering the new thing
are gonna build the bulletproof plant but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it takes you know it takes a
whole community of people growing all this
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff and just randomly some
dudes gonna find something new right and
[SPEAKER_02]: then hopefully that gets shared with the
community and these things kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: passed around and integrated and optimized
right yeah see I speculated that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: at a level in the last five ten years of
the greatest diversity in this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity because of all the the
globalization that's happened and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: more people are growing it that we would
have seen more diversity but you think
[SPEAKER_00]: we've already sort of limited or funneled
down that diversity towards a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific range there's two forces right at
play like one of them like you said we got
[SPEAKER_02]: more people growing more seeds but also
the market there's a fashion in the market
[SPEAKER_02]: right and that fashion is for gas right
and so like you go into a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it in California and I've also
seen it in Canada then do a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like 20 different cultivar names
on the menu but really when you go through
[SPEAKER_02]: and you look at the plants from chemistry
it's like 18 of them all have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical profile right so it's like even
though there probably is genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: across the population it doesn't really
make it to the marketplace right yeah well
[SPEAKER_00]: is this where the the skill of the grower
comes into play in terms of bringing out
[SPEAKER_02]: certain aspects of those genetics through
the rare terpene profile it's really like
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with what people would call a
classic haze plant so we're talking like
[SPEAKER_02]: you know 13 14 week flowering time to grow
it indoors I think we had like three
[SPEAKER_02]: plants of it and it produced like quarter
pound total right and we're talking like
[SPEAKER_02]: three three three foot plants that's like
it really didn't yield shit yeah but the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower was exceptional and the rosin that
came back at a very low rate was even
[SPEAKER_02]: better than the flower right but it's like
you need to grow acres and acres of that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff to have enough material to make an
extract so it's like some plants just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't produce enough so the genetics are
still the driver in your opinion and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we can pull some levers on the
cultivation side at the end of the day it
[SPEAKER_02]: all comes back to good genetics yeah the
genetic I think the genetics are really
[SPEAKER_02]: the key to diversified products in the
marketplace right like you know if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna build a rosin brand it's fine and
dandy to have gas but like everybody's got
[SPEAKER_02]: gas right and so like if you want to build
like a unique brand you might want
[SPEAKER_02]: something like with a really right garlic
smell or like a really floral kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: little all like a real flowery kind of
smell to it right because I think those
[SPEAKER_02]: are the things that are really gonna have
they're the those are the things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really gonna be able to get traction in
the market right or or like we said before
[SPEAKER_02]: with the epilepsy plant right like you
want like having a specific plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: produces a specific chemical profile
that's therapeutic for you know a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: segment of the population like it's the
genetic that allows that product to exist
[SPEAKER_02]: right so I think you know again I'm biased
as a plant leader geneticist but like I
[SPEAKER_02]: really do think that the genetic diversity
is a lot is what allows the product
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiation on the market it's you
know it's not like I don't think the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers if everybody has the same plants I
don't think one grower is gonna be better
[SPEAKER_02]: than everybody else right but if that one
grower has a unique genetic they might be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to fill a market niche that nobody
else can right I mean yes and no coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cultivation side I would say that
given you know the same genetics to
[SPEAKER_00]: different growers you can see different
plant structure different expression
[SPEAKER_00]: different quality of flower just based off
of the ability to grower and not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to grower but the environment
which I tie to the grower the light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that the plants given the light
intensity you know we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate plants quite a bit on that side
but I don't think that discounts if like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're saying and the fact that at
the end of the day it's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are gonna drive a lot of
your of how that plant is gonna finish
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I feel like I'm a grower too don't
don't let me sound like I'm discounting
[SPEAKER_02]: the role of the grower in the creation of
a great product right it definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a huge role and we know this from
wine and we know this from food right like
[SPEAKER_02]: the grower has it definitely an impact on
the outcome of the quality but without
[SPEAKER_02]: that diversity and genetics you know you
can have an excellent grower and a shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic and that grower is not going to be
successful commercially right but if you
[SPEAKER_02]: had an excellent grower even a good
genetic like they might be successful and
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have that grower a really
interesting or unique genetic then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really gonna be able to set themselves
apart the marketplace yeah yeah no I like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like that that's a fair fair
analysis I'll give you that one well Ryan
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks again for your time today I had no
idea where this conversation was go but I
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot and really enjoyed it and
hopefully we can talk again soon for sure

[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get some time to actually hang next
time at one of these events that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great man I'd appreciate it all right have
a great day you too take care that was
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Lee and you are listening to the
cannabis cultivation and science podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Tad Hussey if you like the
podcast please leave us a rating and
[SPEAKER_00]: review I do read them all thanks for
listening you
