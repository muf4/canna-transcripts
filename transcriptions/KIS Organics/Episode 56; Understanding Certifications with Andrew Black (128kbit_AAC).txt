[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, I wanted to
update listeners on what's been going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with Kiss Organics and some of our future
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the process of closing down Kiss
Farm, our seven acre farm and feed store
[SPEAKER_00]: due to issues with the county around
permitting, but it's also been an impetus
[SPEAKER_00]: to refocus our energy around Kiss
Organics, soil science, and research in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently brought Dr. Ben Higgins from
episode 51 into the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already a partner of mine in Kaizen
Consulting and working over at Goldleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get his help in expanding
our in-house research through his
[SPEAKER_00]: connection with Goldleaf and ability to
monitor and set up experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, I had double knee surgery a
couple weeks ago and am slowly getting
[SPEAKER_00]: back up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our first child arriving here any day
now, I'm glad to be moving around better
[SPEAKER_00]: and hope to continue the podcast schedule
to the best of my ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of upcoming podcasts,
I have an exciting one coming up with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darren Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darren was the first person in North
America to earn a PhD with research
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Kaplan has written and published
several peer-reviewed articles on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production, focusing on irrigation,
growing media, fertilization, and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's going on over here at
Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do plan on expanding the availability
of our soils and products to a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: number of states come 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a few years, but we have gotten
our soil and nutrient packs certified for
[SPEAKER_00]: use in organic production with the CDFA in
California, Oregon Tilth, the Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State Department of Agriculture,
and the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of that was done with the help of
my guest this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Black is the certified KIND founder
and director.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew spent the last 11 years working for
Oregon Tilth, one of the nation's most
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted organic certification agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew has worn many hats in organic
certification, including farm program
[SPEAKER_00]: manager, inspector, final reviewer,
Latin American specialist, and
[SPEAKER_00]: certification officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew has inspected hundreds of farms and
food processing facilities in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and Latin America and has made
certification decisions for hundreds more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an expert compliance reviewer for
products certified to the USDA National
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic Program, plus the organic
standards for the European Union,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has hands-on experience growing
plants and greenhouses, and for several
[SPEAKER_00]: years grew vegetables for 15 families from
his small urban farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also been an integral part in
establishing the Sun and Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: certification, which we discussed last
episode with David Brauner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start off giving listeners a little
bit of an introduction to your background
[SPEAKER_00]: in the certification world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been involved doing organic
certification work since 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working as a full-time organic
inspector for Oregon Tilth, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the nation's oldest and largest organic
certifiers of farms and dairies,
[SPEAKER_01]: food processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got involved, and during that
time when I was an inspector, I visited
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of different organic farms
throughout Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had clients over in the Midwest,
and also they speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd get sent to Mexico for six to seven
weeks a year and look at the farms down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all that work, you know,
it was very interesting to see organic
[SPEAKER_01]: farming at different scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to do that work, and then I
got involved behind the scenes at Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilth, helping to make certification
decisions, you know, to approve an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: certificate or to deny it, suspend it,
revoke it, whatever needed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I started managing the Latin
American program that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it's been a great way to
actually get a deep dive into organic
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and food processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I met you, boy, I don't even know how
many years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess five or six years ago
through Jaya Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He introduced us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of my first foray into
learning about certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've set up a certification called
Certified Kind for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to definitely talk about
that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what, I guess, what made you
interested in setting up a certification
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of the challenges around
that that go into that process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the idea for doing like a
cannabis organic certification in a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that goes back pretty far.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of my colleagues at Oregon Tilth
and I, you know, had talked about the need
[SPEAKER_01]: for it within Oregon specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they once Oregon started
allowing medical dispensaries and for like
[SPEAKER_01]: the retail sale of cannabis and medical
dispensaries, that's when it became clear
[SPEAKER_01]: that we needed to have some sort of
certification program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or oversight, because people, everybody
was calling their cannabis organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the folks like me who care about
organic agriculture and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: have had organic farms and certifications
and also work to do inspection work and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing cannabis market as organic was when
we knew that most of it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to put truth in organic cannabis
labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the hard, the hard parts of
doing a certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody thinks it's like easy to
set up a certification program throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been approached a number of times by
other people saying, hey, we want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to set up a, we want to do an
organic certification or, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to get your certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll start our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of always laugh at that because
the, if you're trying to do a professional
[SPEAKER_01]: third party certification, you really have
to have these systems in place to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to receive new applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have the experience to be
able to evaluate the farm plans that they
[SPEAKER_01]: put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk to them at a really high level
about what they're doing, their farming
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but you've got to
manage all this information that you
[SPEAKER_01]: collect that you're using to audit them
and, and hold their feet to the fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when it comes to doing what they
say they're doing and ensuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually farming organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of moving parts
to third party certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the best part for me is
getting out on the farm and seeing what
[SPEAKER_01]: people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few challenges here,
if I'm hearing you correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is setting up the, the rules and
regulations around a certification because
[SPEAKER_00]: the term organic and cannabis is
meaningless because there is, there is no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, certifying certification that
everyone turns to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we look at the ag model you have
or, you know, our foods model,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have, you know, the NOP, the national
organic program that sets standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: then different States will have certifying
programs that match those standards more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have Omri, which is a
third party certifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch really briefly on what
that, what that model looks like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the United States we have the USDA
organic program and that's actually housed
[SPEAKER_01]: under the USDA agricultural marketing
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the national organic program,
which you mentioned is responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of maintaining and curating the
national organic program standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that standard is used by third,
like accredited agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the USDA will credit third parties to
act on their behalf to administer
[SPEAKER_01]: certification program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are 54, around 54, 55 USDA
organic accredited certifiers within the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about 50 outside the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the work of like getting an organic
certification, a USDA organic
[SPEAKER_01]: certification for your farm, your dairy,
your food processing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done by these third parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of those third parties I
already mentioned was Oregon Tilth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are others that people might
know about like QAI or CCOF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stands for certified or California
certified organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The East Coast, there's private certifiers
like New York Organic Farmers Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Omri is actually, only specializes in
material review.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these 54 accredited certifiers,
they specialize in actually certifying
[SPEAKER_01]: that a business meets the USDA organic
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Omri specializes in reviewing
materials such as fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides for compliance to the USDA
organic regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Omri is a special beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a couple other Omri-like
institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is called the WSDA Washington
State Department of Agriculture Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Material Review Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is California Department of
Food and Agriculture's Organic Input
[SPEAKER_01]: Materials Program, the CDFA OIM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they only work with fertilizers,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three entities will do a material
review and approve it for organics or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those 54 other organic certifiers
that work with farms and food processors
[SPEAKER_01]: will respect the decision of Omri WSDA
Organic or CDFA OIM and allow farmers to
[SPEAKER_01]: use those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't totally understand that in my
head exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hearing it is really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know like you were actually,
we hired you at one point to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate with Oregon Tilth and with the
Washington State Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we just recently got our
CDFA approval for organic materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the fertilizer or soil side,
and we register our soil as a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: because technically anything that helps
make a plant grow, they call a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has an NPK value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little more convoluted on my
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having those certifications,
I think, is really powerful because it
[SPEAKER_00]: shows that my product is regulated,
it's tested, and there's third parties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are determining the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that third party aspect is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you mentioned that I
want to just touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, as KISS Organics,
I made a certification around it and
[SPEAKER_00]: called it the KISS Organics certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you used my products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that certification would
carry the same weight as if someone
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliated with my company created a
certification like CertifiedKind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a much more powerful
certification because it's not linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: any products or another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something to consider when we
talk about certifications as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's dive into CertifiedKind a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you set up CertifiedKind,
you were looking to establish a
[SPEAKER_00]: certification that would be as rigorous as
these certifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any standards on the
agricultural side as well, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about material review and
farms that would qualify and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of CertifiedKind was to offer a
professional third party certification for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growers, medical or adult use
that were licensed and permitted in their
[SPEAKER_01]: state to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, what we were trying to do
is to create a program that was very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to how folks get certified on
their organic farms, how they get USD
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we want folks to get the
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of using the term organic to
market their product, we wanted them to
[SPEAKER_01]: use CertifiedKind or CertifiedKind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't want them using the term
organic to market their cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a regulated marketing term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it introduces confusion into the
marketplace if people are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, this weed is organic, but there's no
third party certification or verification
[SPEAKER_01]: system in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CertifiedKind serves that purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to verify that the farms that work
with us get certified are actually only
[SPEAKER_01]: using organic approved fertilizers and
pesticides, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting because you mentioned
the kiss organic soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what I found through working
with a lot of materials manufacturers is
[SPEAKER_01]: that not all the ingredients listed on a
fertilizer or on a pesticide, not all the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients that are actually in the
product are listed on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what happens when you
go through this OMRI certification or a
[SPEAKER_01]: good third party material review is that
they ask for detailed information about
[SPEAKER_01]: the ingredients to verify that the
ingredients that are listed on the label
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the ones that aren't are allowed
in organic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's crazy how strict they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the CDFA, I was hung up for six
months because our source of Neem,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sprayed a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking very, very small amount of
molasses on the product during the
[SPEAKER_00]: production in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I couldn't get the
manufacturer in India, because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: buying it through a couple of third
parties by the time it got to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't willing to list their source
for the molasses, the entire product
[SPEAKER_00]: failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to find another Neem source where
I could get the entire process laid out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which made CDFA a lot harder than some of
the other material review certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's amazing how detailed people get
when there's like a standard involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes a lot of people becomes
very black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they ask you about the Neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell them, oh, they spray molasses on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all of a sudden, you have to track
down, you know, where did that molasses
[SPEAKER_01]: come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why, you know, when people
say when they complain about OMRI,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to me or CDFA, they they're
complaining about OMRI not being rigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: enough or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bunch of BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: OMRI and the CDFA are very rigorous when
it comes to material review.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I wasn't aware that OMRI was as that
strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go down the OMRI route because
they take as a third party certifier part
[SPEAKER_00]: of their business models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a portion of your profits as
payment for the seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose to go with the CDFA and the
WSDA for my certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I learned from you
is that OMRI, if you see that OMRI
[SPEAKER_00]: certification on a product, it means that
the product's been legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legitimately certified and you can
trust that symbol, which I think it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good thing about OMRI, I think this
is something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good thing about OMRI is consumers
recognize and know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers see that label and they go,
OK, it's OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that has value because they
they've captured a certain portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Washington state and
California have that same power,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, because they're a state
regulatory body.
[SPEAKER_00]: People see that as having value,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need we need a unifying certification,
you know, one where and my hope,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, frankly, maybe fairly
transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that certified kind and ones
like Sun and Earth can be those
[SPEAKER_00]: certifications for our industry,
because I know you and I know what this
[SPEAKER_00]: the value of the certification is,
because the challenge there is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have good standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have someone that runs it
that understands what standards should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to have the right
standards and then you have to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right level of regulation and that costs
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, farm visits cost money,
but we need them to happen so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee that what people are saying
they're doing on their farm, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you just I know I kind of rambled
there, but can you talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of that idea of needing a
unifying certification and the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and then if food in the food
industry, you know, the gold standard
[SPEAKER_01]: right now for a third party certification
is USDA organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, it would be really nice
if the consumer could look to just one
[SPEAKER_01]: certification label and say, OK,
it's been it's been certified by,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, certified kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We trust these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we look we know that they do a
professional third party inspection and
[SPEAKER_01]: certification all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice rate to be able to have
something as powerful as USDA organic that
[SPEAKER_01]: symbol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for folks that care about these things,
they could walk into a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for ask for which products are
certified and the but tenors would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to point them in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it'd be I think it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should talk a little bit about
what does a certified kind farm look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before we do, I just want to add one
last thought to your your latest comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as a consumer walking into
dispensary is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of them, I'm sure that
listens to this podcast when they look at
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they're not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know that they were grown
safely and in a manner that they'll want
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when when I walk in, if I see all
these different certifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not know what each certification
stands for and what their standards are
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the value of that seal is on a
given package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's a process of educating
consumers and having enough marketing to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out there that people know what it is
and then also understanding the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, creating a certification and
putting a sticker only has value if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: backed by something, like you said,
in some some level of regulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, let's talk about what what a
certified kind farm actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so just as in organic farming,
you know, the the amount of commitment and
[SPEAKER_01]: dedication to like organic or alternative
farming practice, it's a range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but there are certain things that are
characteristic of a certified kind farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk for a second about the
outdoor farms and then we can sort of talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the indoor farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for for an outdoor farm, what we're
looking for is, first of all, a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: that's only using organic approved
fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's soil amendments, organic
approved potting soil and organic approved
[SPEAKER_01]: pest control materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's the first criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually kind of have to deny a lot
of certification requests because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: folks are using synthetic liquid
fertilizers or synthetic powders that they
[SPEAKER_01]: further gate in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that type of farming is not that's
not for certified kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't work with conventional
non-organic farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our farms are doing things like
using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, you can use daikon radishes
to as a cover crop in the fall and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring, winter and spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really can help to penetrate
soils that have been hard panned due to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation or rototilling.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they decay, you know,
your creating space and habitat for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of microorganisms and natural nutrient
cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on these on these farms, there's a lot
of natural nutrient cycling going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the interesting thing with certified
kind, we include indoor growers in our
[SPEAKER_01]: certification and we hold them to the
certified kind standard for the parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the standard that are applicable to an
indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've been seeing a lot of,
and of course, you're aware of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: selling the soil, is that the trend for an
organic indoor grower is more raised beds
[SPEAKER_01]: and natural nutrient cycling within those
beds, which is pretty interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about, of course,
is like your no till soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really the probably the right
terminology to use in a pure agricultural,
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's these are these are soils that
where you're planting cannabis cycle after
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's really happening
there is you're cutting the stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting the plant out of the of the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we see folks reamending the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing is that in that
indoor setting where you have the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity, you see nutrient
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural nutrient cycling that's off the
hook fast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody somebody grows a comfrey and
does a chop and drop in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gone really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's, you know, microbiology is
taking over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's a really fascinating
thing about the indoor growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what were some of the challenges
with indoor grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was talking with Nate over at
Goldleaf recently, and he said one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that USDA was stuck on our
challenge with was how do they regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 being brought in and some of the
methods for which that happens in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor operation and qualifying those
things for organic standards?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the other challenges with
indoors versus outdoor from an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certification perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, for for a certifier that's working
with USDA organic regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's there are a lot of obstacles to
certifying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of them would be, you know,
do we allow CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in like an indoor space where
you're you're trying to add CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't really done in any other
type of crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no there's really aren't a lot of
indoor organic vegetables being grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not pumping the facility full of
CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon dioxide is not first of all,
first of all, they have to determine if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's synthetic or non-synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, carbon dioxide is that comes in,
you know, maybe that's why there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: hesitation just to allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably are saying that that's
synthetic and that it's synthetic CO2 is
[SPEAKER_01]: not listed as a farm production aid in the
national organic standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you run into roadblocks like that with
some of the practices that are common in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with can a farm use CO2 supplementation
with your current standard with certified
[SPEAKER_00]: kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently I don't think we we have
anyone that's doing CO2 supplementation at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we looked at the standard itself,
we'd probably find that CO2 isn't listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you what, I can check and
maybe get back to you on it, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not one that I was just ready to answer
off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't mean to put you on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that hasn't come up yet,
because I think any a lot of the not any,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of the commercial facilities
would want to supplement CO2 in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize yield just based on the research
out there around lighting and CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm surprised you haven't encountered
that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that there are these challenges
associated with indoor environments that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, another one, another one like
that that I can speak to is sulfur,
[SPEAKER_01]: burning sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in indoor facility or a, you know,
greenhouse in an enclosed space,
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been burning sulfur or
vaporizing sulfur to it's a great way to
[SPEAKER_01]: control fungus and also like hip russet
mites, broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But burning sulfur is not something that's
allowed in organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use micronized sulfur,
but you can't burn sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another spot there where the
organic rules don't really favor some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultural practices that cannabis
growers use indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is potassium silicate,
which I think you and I have talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But potassium silicate or Axil,
a lot of growers like to use this in there
[SPEAKER_01]: as a as a fertilizer, you know,
to add to their pot and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps strengthen the cell walls and
create probably a denser product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: less susceptible to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet using it that way is not allowed
in USDA organic farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point here is that these
regulations that are in place for USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: organic are not no one considered cannabis
production when they were putting these
[SPEAKER_01]: rules together back in when they were
forming them back in the late 1990s and
[SPEAKER_01]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's going to be difficult for
state, you know, the state or the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government to come in and try and offer
organic certification for cannabis without
[SPEAKER_01]: some tweaking of their own rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we should look to write,
you know, if we want to understand how the
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: government will one day regulate and offer
organic certification, we can look to
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in Washington state and
also in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the Department of Agriculture's in
those states are creating their own sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of certification programs for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, you mentioned like
potassium silicate, it is allowed for use
[SPEAKER_00]: with as a spray, a foliar spray for pests,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's listed as allowed in its aqueous
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aqueous potassium silicate for pest
control, disease control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the in the national in the USDA Organic
Rules in the National List.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a product like still Matrix is an
aqueous solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been approved, tom re-approved,
that can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other material made by the same
company, I think it's the same company
[SPEAKER_01]: called Axel 16 would probably get you in
trouble with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certification and we ask at certified time
we ask people to stop using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to or they have it's a
concentrated powder when you receive it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're mixing it with water into a
potassium silicate solution similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you find in the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, could you use the product
if you're not putting it in in its dry
[SPEAKER_00]: form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's it's too highly concentrated
anyway to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you would you would have to say,
well, I'm using this as a pest control
[SPEAKER_01]: material in its aqueous form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the thing is that in the
production of USDA Organic certified
[SPEAKER_01]: fruits and vegetables, nobody's done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we've never seen anybody try and
make the claim, hey, I'm using this
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium silicate powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm adding it to water and I'm spraying it
as a pest control material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making my own still Matrix basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's kind of the argument you'd
have to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would have and then the
certifier would have to receive that
[SPEAKER_01]: argument and then agree to it for you on
your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, but see the the current USDA
Organic certified don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis or cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably they're going to just respond
saying no, you know, because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the life cycle of cannabis or
the specific pest pressures or what people
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use and what they they prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to have a hard time
feeding like, you know, around what a
[SPEAKER_01]: square peg in a round hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so take me through the process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm I'm a cultivator, I'm a grower
and I wanted to consider certified kind or
[SPEAKER_00]: a certification agency for my farm or my
growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what's the process with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, we require that the
farm fill out one of our applications and
[SPEAKER_01]: the application doubles as their organic
system plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all organic farms are supposed to have
an organic system plan that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: describes how they're farming,
how they're compliant to the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us, we have a certified kind
standard that you can download from our
[SPEAKER_01]: website, certified certified dash kind dot
com and the application or the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: system plan document.
[SPEAKER_01]: It asks a series of questions about your
farm and that are applicable to the
[SPEAKER_01]: certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's information that we need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is once that's filled out is we
do a really thorough initial review and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a formal step where we evaluate the
application and then we respond to you
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, you know, hey, these are the
obstacles to certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to change X, Y and Z if you
wanted to to be part of our certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could say, you know, your farm plan
looks excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's proceed to scheduling the
inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we receive a farm plan,
an organic system plan that is complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: and demonstrates compliance to our
standards, then we schedule the on-site
[SPEAKER_01]: inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the on-site inspection, we look at
every facet of cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This on-site inspection, that first time
usually takes between I would say four to
[SPEAKER_01]: five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, we're also with
certified kind, we take a leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and we'll send it to a lab that
tests it for pesticide residue of over 240
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one way that we try and put
teeth into this program so that we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: only verifying through observations on
site that there are no pesticides at the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility or at the farm, but we're taking
this tissue sample and testing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they had applied anything for,
you know, any pesticide over the last six
[SPEAKER_01]: months or over the duration of the life
cycle of that plant, we would catch it in
[SPEAKER_01]: our residue sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of an extra step that a lot
of cannabis certifiers don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're the only one that takes a
tissue sample like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's expensive, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize a farm visit took that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my head, I just, I pictured you
kind of like walking around well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any advanced nutrients on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you guys are okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you sign off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting that it's that
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you are taking that tissue
sample as verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really a key component to
all of this really being successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten a positive result back
on the leaf tissue sample in quite some
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started, we got a few
positive test results from outdoor farms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was such a minor concentration,
you know, that we suspect it was from like
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring drift from a neighboring land
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pesticide drift, or the guy was using
some spray tanks that weren't that he had
[SPEAKER_01]: used in his landscaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business that weren't cleaned out
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't know, you know,
the rules for pesticide residues in
[SPEAKER_01]: different, in different states are
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in, in Oregon, they test for 59
residues, or we're testing for like 220,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever 230.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington, I think it's not even
required for retail cannabis to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can opt in and choose to, but you
don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understood it, there was some
regulation that was put into place and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could be misspeaking here, but as I
understood it, most growers knew that it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't being enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are sort of what happened was
this one particular dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Ike's in Seattle kind of became like
a third party check for people and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: found that a lot of, not a lot,
but a significant number of farms have
[SPEAKER_00]: failed for things like Michael butanol and
Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's been really, it's been
really challenging here in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state because at the end of the day,
like you're taking people's word for
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I like about a certified
kind with this, this tissue testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have some quantifiable third
party data that shows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unequivocally that this material is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you're developing a
certification system, third party
[SPEAKER_01]: certification system, a lot, there is a
lot of it that's built around trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this testing kind of counter balances
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, it's the other thing
about third party certification is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: we were to certify somebody and then find
out that they had been cheating using
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers or pesticides or, or selling
product that didn't come from their farm
[SPEAKER_01]: as certified product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a huge hit to the
farm's reputation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you have the force of
residue testing, but also reputation,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these folks reputations are on the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they, when they sign up in part of a
certification, you know, they can be proud
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, Hey, well, you know, we,
we walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we went through the certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they end up having to drop out for
some reason, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't look too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what you're saying essentially,
the idea is that a company, a grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: buying in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money for the certification and
you're not the cheapest certification out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of the reasons that you just
listed, but if they buy in essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: they're buying into your certification,
your reputation, that, that the certified
[SPEAKER_00]: kind brand has value because of the
stringency in the regulations that you put
[SPEAKER_00]: in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they were to lose that because
they cheated or something else happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause that is, I mean, it happens that
that potentially would hurt their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their company quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, by getting this
certification, the idea is that as people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even more and more consumers
start worrying about organic quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: how their cannabis and medicine are being
produced, that that cannabis will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher market value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can get maybe 20% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that number up, but, but enough of
an increase in their sales and the price
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flower that they're growing to
offset the cost of the certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's where so far the
cannabis certifications have struggled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a struggle to get that price
premium for the grower that is part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with certified kind, yeah, you know,
folks are able to get a price premium and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're also able to get into dispensary
that they might not otherwise have an
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they can go into dispensary and
the dispensary knows what certified kind
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're certified kind grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to, you know, some folks have
to approach dispensaries just cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: either just cold calling on these
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the certifications can help make
business connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help, it can help prove to some
complete stranger that there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that they're farming in a
certain style, a certain way organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, I should
probably mention the Sun and Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the interesting things
about Sun and Earth certified,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm also a part of, is that they've
been able to demand for the Brother
[SPEAKER_01]: David's brand anyway, that's the,
the cannabis brand that David Bronner's
[SPEAKER_01]: has created.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nonprofit cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been able to leverage a 10% price
premium for their growers that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: are marketing with them.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just touch on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your job as a certifier is,
or a certifying agency, such as Sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth or certified kind is, one,
to make sure that, that the farm is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what they say they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the product that's coming out of the
farm is clean and in theory, organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your, your other job is to
educate the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So educate dispensaries so that when
customers come in and ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's, what's your safest cannabis or
what's your, you know, cleanest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most organic cannabis, they can look at
the certified kind or Sun and Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: certification as a way of knowing that
product is, is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a certain quality or at least produced
a certain, in a certain fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, to educate consumers so
that a medical patient or even a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational user, like someone up here in
Washington could walk into a store and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, Hey, what, what can I get that's,
that's organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that term actually might mean
something they can, then they could point
[SPEAKER_00]: to certified kind or in California,
you know, certified kind and Sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of challenges associated
with a, with setting up a certifying
[SPEAKER_00]: agency like yourself that I think people
need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's, let's talk about Sun and Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sun and Earth goes so far beyond
organic standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I just interviewed David Bronner
yesterday and I'm going to be putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: both these podcasts really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just give your quick take
on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, we did talk about it already and
I know you haven't heard David's podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're kind of firing from the hip,
but what's your, what's your quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one to two minutes minute
version of the Sun and Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: certification?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, if certified kind is
helping to ensure that growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: following organic standards, Sun and Earth
certified goes beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's a level up from certified
kind because it only, they'll only certify
[SPEAKER_01]: or outdoor growers that are planting in
native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means under the Sun and in the
Earth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's called Sun and Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also, so there's three pillars
to Sun and Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Earth care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the most rigorous part of the
standard right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two are community engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's human empowerment and
community engagement are the other two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with having written
policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, for employees that protect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with engaging with the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now it's creating a written
strategy about how you will engage and
[SPEAKER_01]: uplift the local community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way the cannabis farms aren't
just acting in isolation, not just
[SPEAKER_01]: exploiting land and resources,
but giving back to the local community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the cultivation side though,
there's also additional standards there
[SPEAKER_01]: that make it pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, one of the, one of the
hardest parts is producing your own
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility on your, from, on farm
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the requirement that requires
composting on site, increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity, you know, so on,
on these farms so far, a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: on the smaller side, but there are some
that are, you know, around 40,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing things like polyculture,
which means planting cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the farms planted potatoes on both
sides of their cannabis row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just talking like one potato
here and there, but like a full on potato
[SPEAKER_01]: planting every foot for 300 feet on both
sides of the cannabis row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of commitment to biodiversity on
the farm and, and growing food on the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these farms,
there's a farm down there that's sun or
[SPEAKER_01]: certified that only uses this plant,
this algae, this blue, it's like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a algae that has a symbiotic
relationship with cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called azolla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a lot of research on algae,
but I'm somewhat familiar with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty, it's an interesting
subject for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there's a farm down there that has
a pond that's covered in azolla and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just take the azolla out of the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that prolific in their pond and they
use that as a soil amendment and they use
[SPEAKER_01]: water and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so the Sun and Earth certified
program is trying to help these small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale family farmers in, in, in Northern
California maintain their way of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their partner in that program is Dr.
Bronner's and they have a, David Bronner
[SPEAKER_01]: has his own nonprofit cannabis brand
called Brother David's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farms that are, that, that they
put underneath that brand get a price
[SPEAKER_01]: premium and are pretty happy with the
arrangement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other important piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, if you're going to
have a third party certification,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have to take care of the farmer
and we have to educate the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think all I think the Sun and
Earth program is nice because it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to raise the awareness of certification,
the value of certification in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully it will become a model where
we can have more of a unified cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: certification nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that model is really that these
cannabis brands that are profiting off the
[SPEAKER_01]: farms themselves are paying in to help the
farmers pay for certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: These brands are helping pay for education
about why regenerative organic practices
[SPEAKER_01]: are important and why consumers should
vote with their dollar and, and support
[SPEAKER_01]: these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that you have a
company as, you know, as wonderful and
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical as, as Dr. Bronner supporting you
in this certification is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that goes a long way and
really getting, getting the message out
[SPEAKER_00]: for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the, the standard itself,
I suggest everyone, even if you're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thinking that's the direction
you're going to go with your farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest people go out there and just
take a look at it on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have the links to everything on the
podcast page for certified kind and Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: and Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would give you an idea of what,
what standards are necessary if you decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to be organic, or even if
you're not ready to go there right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the future, if you see,
you know, in your state, that becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has value, this is a way to
set yourself up to be successful now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know with Sun and Earth,
and I haven't, I need to go back and read
[SPEAKER_00]: the standards for certified kind,
but I know with Sun and Earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like with the USDA, you need to have
three years of organic practices on a
[SPEAKER_00]: property before you can be even
considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way organic certification works around
the world is they've selected three years
[SPEAKER_01]: as the transition period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you need to have a clean land
history for the three years prior to the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest that you're going to be calling
certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that means people need to plan
ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that's interesting is
that in a, in an indoor setting where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're coming in containers with new
organic approved potting soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, you can decrease that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you know, you can get a certification
more quickly on virgin land or fallow land
[SPEAKER_01]: that hasn't been farmed in the last three
years, or an indoor facility with new
[SPEAKER_01]: potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be clear, you've looked at,
you know, my recipe in my soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil would qualify, KISS Organic Soil
qualifies for your program, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a number of the indoor growers are
using your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so qualified for organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's WSDA approved and sounds like it's
CDFA OIM approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my, that was my kind of shameless
plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, you know, no, and I think
we also got it approved with Oregon Tulse
[SPEAKER_01]: a few years, a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I really appreciate your help
with all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there anything you want to add
just before we sign off regarding what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing on these farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you are visiting so many farms,
any, you know, potential pitfalls or
[SPEAKER_00]: stumbling blocks that are really common
for farms that are interested in moving
[SPEAKER_00]: towards organic certification?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pitfall would be to not do your
research, not do your homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want organic certification,
you can't rely on somebody trying to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you or, or, or to convince you that a
certain fertilizer is allowed in organics
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you absolutely know that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, I see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, uneducated people or
people that don't really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: organics means, trying to convince
managers or owners that a certain input is
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed when it has actually synthetic
calcium nitrate in it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: monopotassium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so first of all, do your homework and
get away from bottled nutrients because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the bottled nutrients do have
synthetic chemical fertilizers in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole concept of organics is
trying to enhance natural nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that in, if you're an indoor
grower and you can do that definitely if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I think that folks are starting to
experiment with plant ferments and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people that are deep into plant
ferments, this is like Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they see higher or unique terpenes
being expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a strategy in organics
would be not to put all your eggs in one
[SPEAKER_01]: basket either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, you know, although some of
these things are trending right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you always have to keep an open mind,
but stick with what you, what works for
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a lot of folks that's,
you know, if they're outdoor growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You evaluate it and you apply organic soil
amendments prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we learned with hemp this year
was that if done properly, you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply any other amendment or for,
or a fertigation step at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so devising like these simple systems
is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a complex feeding schedule is,
isn't necessary and, and it, it is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to confuse you and you're
not going to know how to tweak it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say just, you know, if you're
trying to go organic, go as simple as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to build on your, your previous
comment, one thing I learned from being a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier to the organic industry on the ag
and horticulture side is you always want
[SPEAKER_00]: to check with a certifier before you apply
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure about a bottled
nutrient or an amendment or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, call up a certifier and double check
those lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look on the Omri list and you
can look on the WSDA and CDFA lists and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if that product is listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not, do not apply it without
talking to whoever certifier you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, because it's much easier to
go to not apply a product than it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the aftermath of applying
something that wasn't allowed.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because you get your land kicked
out for three years for applying something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not allowed in organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hey Andrew, I really appreciate your
time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we, I thought we covered a lot
around certification and I'll include your
[SPEAKER_00]: information if people have specific
questions, but thanks for, thanks for your
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope people will check out certified
kind and the sun and earth certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Black was certified kind and the
sun and earth certification.
