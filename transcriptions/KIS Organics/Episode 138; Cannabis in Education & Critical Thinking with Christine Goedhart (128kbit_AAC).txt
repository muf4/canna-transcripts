[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Christine Goodhart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christine is an experienced educator and
educational developer with a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialization in teaching undergraduate
biology courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently serving as a science education
specialist at the University of British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia, she supports faculty in making
their courses more equitable and
[SPEAKER_01]: student-centered, and she recently
developed and taught an undergraduate
[SPEAKER_01]: biology of cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, Christine spent eight years as
a full-time faculty member at Citrus
[SPEAKER_01]: College, where she taught a variety of
biology courses for non-major students.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a strong commitment to
student-centered and inclusive education,
[SPEAKER_01]: Christine has effectively implemented
innovative assessment strategies to
[SPEAKER_01]: enhance student engagement and learning in
biology courses, and she shares
[SPEAKER_01]: information, tips, and evidence-based best
practices for teaching in her Tips for
[SPEAKER_01]: Teaching blog article series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Christine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so for listeners, I just want to
mention I met Christine virtually when you
[SPEAKER_01]: sent me an email about a course that
you're putting together at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of British Columbia, also UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so excited to hear from you and hear
about this course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about the
course and what your process was in
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course at UBC is called Biology of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really something that I worked on
with a research faculty here in the botany
[SPEAKER_00]: department at UBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have several people who do
their research on cannabis within the
[SPEAKER_00]: botany department.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one research faculty who was
interested in creating this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a strong passion and love for
cannabis myself, so I was also very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in this concept of a biology of
cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked together to get the course
created, get it through the approval
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and it is really designed to be a
course that can be taken by any
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate in the university for their
science breath requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just for biology majors,
it's for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept behind it is to use cannabis
like a case study or a vehicle for
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching students about foundational
biological concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like genetics and biochemistry and
metabolism, ecology, evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, process of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using it as a context to help students
understand these concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with this faculty member to get
the course created, and then once we knew
[SPEAKER_00]: it was approved, once it was on the course
schedule, then I got to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: developing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to be the one to teach the
first version of it, which happened last
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: My expertise is in teaching and learning
in biology at the undergraduate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that I decided to do was
to go out and talk to as many people as I
[SPEAKER_00]: could who were actually working with
cannabis in real-world ways and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, okay, what's going on with biology in
the real-world cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I bring this into the course to
make it real-world oriented, to really
[SPEAKER_00]: ground it in what's going on within
cannabis, and to make it interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: relatable and understandable to students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really focused on making it as
real-world oriented and interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: relatable and meaningful as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this course, you were really talking
about a lot of high-level biological
[SPEAKER_01]: concepts, just trying to expose listeners
and using cannabis as your tool for this,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a path towards learning about all these
different topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the gist of what the goal was of
the course?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was really, it was like the
vehicle, it was like the selling point to
[SPEAKER_00]: get students to understand and be
interested in these foundational
[SPEAKER_00]: biological concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you reached out to me, obviously,
that's how I met you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a conversation via email about some
of the curriculum that you were putting
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask who else you reached out to?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not comfortable saying names,
maybe you could talk about what topics or
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of expertise that these people had
and what feedback you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people in a very diverse range
of aspects within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people in cultivation,
so people who are involved in breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are involved in growing
cannabis, I talked to people who were
[SPEAKER_00]: researching cannabis in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people who were involved in
product production and quality assurance
[SPEAKER_00]: within cannabis cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people who were involved in
medical cannabis, so doctors who were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using this within their practice,
their clinical practice, and different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of doctors too, who were focusing on
different populations of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a lot of different people and
it started off like it was a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a snowball approach where I just started
reaching out to people who I at first had
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I use cannabis myself and so
I reached out to the person who owns the
[SPEAKER_00]: store of the cannabis that I usually go to
and she connected me to some people who
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it and then they connected me to some
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I kept doing these interviews,
one question that I would always include
[SPEAKER_00]: in the interviews was, is there anyone
else that you recommend I talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, this became almost
exponential in my list of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really led me to lots of different
types of people that I never would have
[SPEAKER_00]: come into contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably never would have even known
about that aspect of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, talking to someone who works
in quality assurance in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I knew that that position existed,
but being able to actually talk to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who does that really made it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just such an unbelievable learning
experience to talk to all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One personal curiosity I had was,
was there anything that you learned from
[SPEAKER_01]: this process that was really interesting
that you were just unaware of?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the quality control,
but from talking to all these people,
[SPEAKER_01]: was there something just like an
interesting fact about cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was unexpected in your
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into this process thinking that I
had a pretty good understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but I realized I did not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this really made it clear to me
that when you are going to be teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: about something, as an individual,
you only have a limited understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to go out and you need to
talk to the people who are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: working with that topic in the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about photo period
sensitivity before doing these interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about really the intricacies
of the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about the importance of emission
control, which became part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation game that I incorporated into
the course based on someone who was
[SPEAKER_00]: studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never would have known that that was a
big aspect of growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to manage the odors that are
coming from the cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, in all of the different ways that
cannabis is used by humans in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking with these different doctors and
really learning about how they were
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing cannabis, the types of
cannabis that they were prescribed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process that they were using,
and the different types of indications
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were prescribing cannabis for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible how much I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't have to tell this to you,
Tad, because you probably have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar experience with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably everyone that you interview,
it's little revelations that come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn so much by talking to someone in
a 30-minute conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that I learned so much more in
that 30-minute conversation talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabis professionals than I ever
could have by spending hours and hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: research on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more understandable because it was
in context.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about cannabis in
real-world ways and how they were
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made what they were telling me even
more understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up two points that I just
wanted to highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is this idea of real-world experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the reasons I started this
podcast was because we have research
[SPEAKER_01]: happening at various universities now,
but there's a huge gap between that and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening in reality in an actual
working facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always these sacrifices that we
have to make in any grow environment that
[SPEAKER_01]: just doesn't happen in these universities
in a growth chamber where they can control
[SPEAKER_01]: every aspect of the grow and they have
grant funding to be able to afford all the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment that they need to create this,
quote-unquote, perfect experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal with the podcast was really to
bridge that gap between academia and
[SPEAKER_01]: research and share that more broadly with
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm trying to bring in more growers
to share about their experiential
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and wisdom because I think
that's really important too and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to talk about this cultivation
game that you put together because it
[SPEAKER_01]: really highlights this process in a very
simplified, easy to understand manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that you brought up
was this idea of reaching out to various
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the industry and experts in
their perspective fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done the same and in my personal
experience is people are really willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: share their knowledge and willing to talk
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some time just because they're
passionate about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage people if you read
something or you find someone to try
[SPEAKER_01]: writing to them or reaching out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get rejected all the time for this
podcast with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm amazed at how
many people do get back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even people like yourself at university
willing to take some time to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about topics that they're
knowledgeable in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to share a similar
experience as what you had in building
[SPEAKER_01]: this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will echo that because almost everyone
that I reached out to agreed to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, which I was so honored by because I
feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, you're giving your time and your
knowledge and your expertise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a gift and a privilege to get,
but people are happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to share about what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I echo your recommendation to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in talking to
someone, reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's move on to talk a little bit
about this cultivation game that you put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can put something up on the
podcast page that shows this so people can
[SPEAKER_01]: see what I'm looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take me through a little bit of
this exercise that you did?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like in-person in the class
itself on a given day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Tad, this class activity,
I think of it as a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of my conversation with you
and also from listening to your podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say, when I was doing interviews,
I would always ask people who someone I
[SPEAKER_00]: should talk to, your name came up quite a
bit and your podcast came up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was talking to you and as I was
listening to your podcast, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me to understand a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped me to understand that there are
some really key aspects that are necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, to grow cannabis,
you need to provide the plants with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to provide them with water and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to provide them with proper
atmospheric conditions and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management, especially in the case of
indoor growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that you have to have
as part of your cultivation facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, there are many, many
different ways to be able to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different ways to provide
plants with nutrients and water,
[SPEAKER_00]: with atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different ways to do pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were two key things that I've really
learned from you and your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were two things that I realized this
is what students need to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, that there are these key
foundational things that cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of different
options within all of those key factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to think about getting students
to understand this in the form of a game,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cultivation facility game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-stage activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves two sets of groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first group is known as the expert
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I split up students into these expert
groups where they were assigned to really
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate and learn about one of the key
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lighting group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a group, they had to do some research
and figure out, why is lighting so
[SPEAKER_00]: important?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the plants get out of light that
they need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave them some options for how
light is often provided to plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three major options that I gave them
were fluorescent grow lights, HID,
[SPEAKER_00]: high-intensity discharge grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your HPS approach, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third option I gave them was LED
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each of those options, they had to
research the pros and then also the cons
[SPEAKER_00]: because no option is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every option comes with its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to a lighting group,
I also had a pest management group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their job was to really research pest
management, what goes into that,
[SPEAKER_00]: why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave them three options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to look into the pros and cons of
tape strips or monitoring cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, and pesticides and
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had another group for atmospheric
conditions, another group for water and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to research media-based systems,
inorganic media and organic soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with different irrigation systems,
hand watering, sprinkler system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also had to look into the pros
and cons of different water-based systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also had an emissions control group
because like I mentioned, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that came out of one of the
interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that this is an important aspect
of growing cannabis, emission control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave them a number of options for
that group to also look at the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all of these groups had time to
research their specific growth factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I split them up into what's known as
jigsaw groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an activity known as a jigsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept is that in the second set of
groups, the jigsaw groups, you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert representative from each of the
expert groups that's now coming together
[SPEAKER_00]: so that this new jigsaw group has all of
the different pieces of the puzzle that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to need to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, to create a cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the jigsaw groups, there was an
expert from the lighting, an expert from
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient and water, an expert from
atmosphere, an expert from emission
[SPEAKER_00]: control, an expert from pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them some time to just educate one
another, inform one another about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: different options were and maybe share
which one that they thought was best based
[SPEAKER_00]: on their understanding of the pros and the
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as a group, they had to make a choice
about what they were going to choose for
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these major factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had to provide me with a one to
two sentence explanation just to let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know what led them to that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the gist of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one other thing to mention was before
they came into class, I wanted them to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some exposure to these different
options and also to see what cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a pre-class assignment, I asked them to
watch these little video clips of tours
[SPEAKER_00]: through some different types of
cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really tried to give them videos of
different types of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were warehouses, some were
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some used hydroponics, some used organic
soil, some used inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to actually see what this looked
like through these video tours and hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from the people that were actually growing
cannabis and talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about the different parts of
their facility and how it worked and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did come in with a little bit of
background knowledge about each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that this exercise or this game is
striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's structured around the idea of
limiting factors because it's one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite ways to approach cultivation in
general is to look at what the limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factor is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always head straight to fertility,
but a lot of times it can be your watering
[SPEAKER_01]: or your environment or your lighting and
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about management of these
limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that manner, I think this exercise is
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave each group an imaginary $12,
I think, or 12 money bags as your client
[SPEAKER_01]: is shown here in the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they have to make choices based on
energy cost, yield, and sustainability,
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything has a rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to me, funny enough,
that aquaponics was the winning choice of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that were sent to me because it's
probably the least common actual method of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, especially commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that the students
gravitated towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to touch on that before we go
over some of the options that people had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as their choice for the aquaponics
or just as the different results that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out from the students, what they chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking more in terms of
aquaponics, but if you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the different results, I think that's
ultimately what I want to get into here as
[SPEAKER_01]: we go through it because I think it's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about some of the options that
people had to choose from on the various
[SPEAKER_01]: different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also really struck by how many
groups chose aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, pretty all of the
groups chose a water-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them chose organic soil or
inorganic media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all chose either aquaponics,
hydroponics, or aeroponics, and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, like you mentioned, aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite know what to make out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding, this is quite rare
in the cultivation world.
It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks my heart a little bit that no
one chose actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if I had 10 minutes in front
of them, I could talk them all into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not the point of this exercise.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it's curious to think about
where they're coming up with these ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had just very quickly seen
these different types of cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: research, looking at internet sites,
internet research, looking at pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, what led them to these
decisions was their own research,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also their values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that go into making these
choices are definitely your context,
[SPEAKER_00]: your location, your budgetary constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, I did give them a
budgetary constraint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only gave them 12 money bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each option, there was a cost
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with lighting, fluorescent
grow lights, that was half a money bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they wanted to choose the
high-intensity discharge grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was two money bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to spend more for that type of
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED grow lights, that was three money
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to make choices depending on the
amount of upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also gave them information about energy
required to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: More energy required means more or higher
ongoing operating costs and a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If students were caring about energy
required, to operate, then that might have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone into their decision-making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them information about yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these options are more conducive
to higher yields than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave them information about
sustainability, how sustainable each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these options were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students, it's quite interesting to think
about what was going into their
[SPEAKER_00]: decision-making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was their understanding of the pros and
cons, their own values associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe cost effectiveness, sustainability,
energy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something though about
aquaponics that was really drawing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the lighting exercise alone,
since you brought that up, the choice is
[SPEAKER_01]: really between the HID lights and LEDs
just based on the light intensity and
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the decision that I see facilities
have to face in the real world all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time is, can I afford the upfront upfront
cost of going with LED lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that is dependent on the energy
provider and if they offer rebates and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, a lot of times LED
lights can become more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then looking at because of the massive
amount of electrical costs associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: running an indoor facility, we just put
together an estimate for a company here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington that's one of the largest
indoor producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have an ROI by switching to
LEDs because they initially set up as HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years ago in less than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just off the electrical, not counting the
yields for raising their overall PPFT
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, but just on the electrical savings
alone and the rebates from their energy
[SPEAKER_01]: provider would give them an ROI of less
than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a real decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I spend the money upfront to have a
more efficient way of growing or am I
[SPEAKER_01]: tapped out on resources and setting up
this facility and the infrastructure to
[SPEAKER_01]: where I have to go with a more affordable
option like HPS initially, knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to end up paying a lot more down
the road in electrical and it's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you put that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the aquaponics side, interesting
enough, I looked into aquaponics myself
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think I think as someone who's
been to UBC and actually dated someone
[SPEAKER_01]: from UBC for a little while, I fit with
that mentality and understand this student
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be drawn there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked into aquaponics myself and found
that in Washington state where I live,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to have a heated indoor
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't run aquaponics in my greenhouse
to keep the fish alive through the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sustainable fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved away from that for my vegetable
growing and all of that, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I was drawn to initially
for that idealism of the whole concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it would work in some locations and
not in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really drives home this personalized
approach to making these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take into account the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your constraints?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to scale up or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to scale up if you chose
a certain option?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your values?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you most care about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, the student
population, they might be bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain values that are driving your
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your permission, I'll share these so
people can see this online and get an idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of real life choices that I think every
facility should be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're just at the very beginning
levels of setting up a cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, this lists out the sorts of
questions you should be asking yourself in
[SPEAKER_01]: a very simplified manner in terms of the
choices that you'll be making as you move
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that I really wanted to
get you on the podcast and I think in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of actionable, useful information
for growers that listen to the podcast is
[SPEAKER_01]: this next part of it is this lecture you
put together on evaluating sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this speaks more broadly across
all of society nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just inundated with information on
the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, your students were influenced
by the information that they read around
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics in their research to go that
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me wonder, how do we best
evaluate a product or best evaluate an
[SPEAKER_01]: authoritative source of information on the
Internet to know that it's factual or
[SPEAKER_01]: really good quality information?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great topic to really
dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing that I got from you
in my conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a conversation with you and actually
from several other people that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people talked about the importance
of being able to evaluate information,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially about cannabis because there's
some really great information out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's just junk misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you separate that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you separate out maybe marketing
from useful information?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much marketing out there that's
disguised as information, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually really trying to sell something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning to be a discerning consumer of
information is just a powerful,
[SPEAKER_00]: useful tool in today's society.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I got from you and
from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided then that it had to be included
in the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to include training and practice
with information evaluation in the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to incorporate it in different
ways throughout the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the course, we started off very early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was the fourth class session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lesson specifically on
information evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first asked students to do an Internet
search using a query about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could use whatever Internet search
engine they wanted, but I had them all
[SPEAKER_00]: type in the same query.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them type in, does CVD help to treat
anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that we were talking
about in the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they typed that in and hit the
return button, I had them evaluate the top
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 websites that were listed in their
results and determine which source,
[SPEAKER_00]: which results from their search they
thought was most reliable or trustworthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and which was least reliable or
trustworthy, and to explain their choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what characteristics made
them think that a site that they chose was
[SPEAKER_00]: most reliable and what characteristics
made them think that a site that they
[SPEAKER_00]: chose as least reliable was actually least
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said some really interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that they mentioned as
far as what they thought made something
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable was that it provided high-quality
sources as evidence for claims,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was a peer-reviewed article that was
published in a reputable academic journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students really put a lot of weight in
that, peer-reviewed published articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was written or reviewed by someone
who was a credentialed expert in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it was a reputable organization,
they would cite things like .gov or .edu
[SPEAKER_00]: sources as being more reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the information was comprehensive and
fact-based, if it didn't appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: biased, and if the source looked
professional in appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some things that they said made them
think a site was unreliable was if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: written by someone without credentialed
expertise in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them pointed to a certain site
that was a blog that was written by
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who didn't have any credentialed
expertise in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were grammar or sentence
structure issues, if it didn't cite where
[SPEAKER_00]: the information was coming from when they
were making a claim, or if it cited poor
[SPEAKER_00]: quality evidence such as a blog or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the information was too general or lack
specifics, if it was anecdotal such as
[SPEAKER_00]: just one person's experience, and if they
saw a lot of advertising or a very
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy-handed effort to try to sell
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were things that they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually what I probably would
have told them to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with everything that they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are very thoughtful answers
on their part.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my personal experience, I think in the
cannabis industry especially, we put too
[SPEAKER_01]: much emphasis on this idea of recognized
authority or who the industry lifts up
[SPEAKER_01]: based on number of followers or views
around social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think some of the best and
smartest people I see in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily have a large social
media following because their focus is on
[SPEAKER_01]: research or education, or they're a
successful grower and they're spending
[SPEAKER_01]: their time running a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not posting videos every day on
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one thing that I think not to
your students, but just in general to this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that I do push back on a little
bit in regards to liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to put less emphasis on recognized
authority unless we're talking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, we're talking about someone
who has put in the time and really has
[SPEAKER_01]: been shown to have peer-reviewed work that
they're promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have any thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can definitely see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably cannabis is a special
situation in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I think about this from the
lens of someone that look turns to on my
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obviously a for-profit company that
puts together this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a skew and bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards living soils, even though I do try
to get people on that will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: other topics, there's definitely a heavy
lean in content towards organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do also manufacture soils and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people should take that into
account when evaluating the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast as a source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that that discredits the
information that's provided on here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it needs to be viewed through
that lens just to be objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair, there's podcasts that I've
published that I now, if I could wave a
[SPEAKER_01]: magic wand, I would go back and probably
delete as I've evolved as a cultivator in
[SPEAKER_01]: my understanding of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people did come onto the
podcast and either shared information that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel was fully accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a gray area there on some of the
information they shared or it may have
[SPEAKER_01]: been focused more around a product or
technology than I would have necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: liked to see, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's really great that you have that
self-awareness about this too,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you are aware of your own biases
and expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the key aspects of
being able to effectively evaluate sources
[SPEAKER_00]: is just we all come in with our own
biases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I had to deal with too
as I was creating this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped up against my own biases several
times, but being aware of them allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to then be able to overcome them or make
it so that they're not clouding your
[SPEAKER_00]: judgment in that evaluation or in the
information that you're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not discounting something that is
actually quite reputable and credible,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not putting unnecessary stock
in something that you want to be true or
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want to dive into some of these
scenarios that you created in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about this idea of evaluating a
source?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be a good, you think,
use of time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there another way to approach it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, Tad, I'm wondering because
we had chatted a little bit through email,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was really fascinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had shared with me your process for
evaluating products, and I thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really quite insightful, and I really
appreciated your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if you can share a little
bit about your- I'm happy to share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say I put this together pretty
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did go back and pull up the email so I
could see what I wrote you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put as much thought into it,
but it's ingrained into me now that it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't take me more than 10 minutes to
write this up because it's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I spent more time thinking about
than I even realized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I'll read off this list if you think
that would be good, and then maybe you can
[SPEAKER_01]: give me your feedback on it and tell me
good, bad, and areas that I might have
[SPEAKER_01]: missed or maybe what my bias is as I share
this with you because I found it as an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cognitive process when evaluating
product online, and I hope that other
[SPEAKER_01]: people would have a similar process even
if the steps are a little different,
[SPEAKER_01]: is I always start from a process of
skepticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me picturing myself walking around
an industry trade show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why in my head that's just
where I went to as I was going through
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always start from the perspective of
skepticism, and then I collect data
[SPEAKER_01]: information to change my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always assume that the product doesn't
work, and then they or myself has to
[SPEAKER_01]: convince myself, oh, no, this might have a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to start reading the
ingredient label and see what the person
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to put on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: If most of it is proprietary, that's a
pretty big red flag, and that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a hurdle that's going to be very,
very challenging for me to get past.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say it's a deal-breaker,
but it's going to be a pretty substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's not a lot of information about
that product online beyond the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: so as other people are not talking about
it, and its marketing appeals are
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily testimonials or side-by-side
photos, I just don't put a lot of weight
[SPEAKER_01]: in those as credible sources, and I know
that's something that your students
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a company I've not heard of before
or is not established in the horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: or agricultural industries and is just
marketing to cannabis, that to me is a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of a red flag just because it's such a
narrow industry focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a nutrient or plant growth
enhancer but has a low amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility, so not a lot of NPK,
or claims to have a new or better mode of
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery or assimilation by the plant,
you hear things like nanotechnology or
[SPEAKER_01]: micronized, or I had a guy telling me
about his prehistoric carbon source,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it turned out he was just talking
about humic acid, but we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is just the framing of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terms exist for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these technologies are very valid,
but it's definitely something I'm a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more skeptical around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I like to see if a product is
actually registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's supposed to be registered with the
Washington State Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture, Oregon Department of Ag,
California Department of Ag, that shows me
[SPEAKER_01]: that this company has done their due
diligence to be legally marketed and sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can also read what they registered the
product for in terms of heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK values, what their guaranteed analysis
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if I've gotten this far and I'm still
interested, then I look at is this product
[SPEAKER_01]: closing an ecological loop or is it more
sustainable than anything that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I think of things like biochar,
where we're reclaiming carbon or insect
[SPEAKER_01]: frass, where we're able to take a waste
product that the insect's end can consume
[SPEAKER_01]: from our compost and make into a usable
nutrient product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there less of a fossil fuel cost to get
the same nutrients or fertility that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I think of something like guano,
which is shipped from overseas,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a huge fossil fuel cost, is damaging
to the local ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's organic, it's not
necessarily something that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily choose to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get through all of that and I'm still
interested, then I'll set up a trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get a positive response from that,
then I'll figure out from there,
[SPEAKER_01]: what limiting factor in my cultivation
practices was that product addressing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll say, is there a more affordable
way for me to get there than this product?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then this product is something
that I want to add to my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite an extensive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last thing I mentioned on here
that I look for is the network of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when it comes to entomology
or IPM stuff, if my friend Suzanne
[SPEAKER_01]: Wainwright Evans, the bug lady,
if she recommends it, that to me is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because she is so authoritative to me
in terms of my respect for her knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and expertise in her field that I don't
need to question it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would skip all of the above steps that I
listed for that reason because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: she's already done all that for me and
much more thoroughly than I could be based
[SPEAKER_01]: on her expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few people in the industry
that I turn to like that, but it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: select list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so happy that you shared this with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's so insightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really showcases all of your experience
over years, honing this process and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out what has worked and what have
been some of the things that have led you
[SPEAKER_00]: astray in the past and putting that in now
to your process so that you don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: those same mistakes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to your podcast quite a bit and
I know that you refer to Suzanne a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one in particular, I also think is so
important for people to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like an anchor source.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trusted anchor source to go to when
you're unsure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this can be especially helpful,
especially if you're not very familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with that given field or context.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be an expert like Suzanne for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a reputable organization or
company that's proven their credibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and that you really trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find someone who you know that you can
trust and if you're unsure, you reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do all this research
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find someone and it can be
different people in different contexts
[SPEAKER_00]: that can serve as this anchor source for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you mentioned that I
think is so important is starting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: place of skepticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into viewing each new source or product
or whatever with a healthy dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: skepticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not taking anything at face value but
expecting that it will need to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: you rather than you giving it the benefit
of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple other things that I might
add to a list that we've already talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about is be aware of your biases and
expectations going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all bring our own baggage based on our
previous experience, what we want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can either cause us to disregard
something credible or to overlook glaring
[SPEAKER_00]: red flags, both of which will prevent us
from being able to properly evaluate that
[SPEAKER_00]: information or that source.
[SPEAKER_00]: As humans, we're very prone to something
called confirmation bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this tendency to seek out and favor
things that will confirm or support what
[SPEAKER_00]: we already believe or what we want to
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cloud our judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being aware of biases and
expectations going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I might say is compare the
information with other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just stop with one source but
compare it with other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing something that is way out
from what you've seen elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be a red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just keep practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to evaluate is like,
it's a skill that you develop over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these eyes that you develop over
time and you just see you get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell with your list, that was the
result of you practicing, evaluating for a
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've honed your evaluation eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's because I've made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first came into this industry,
because I came to cannabis in a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: fashion, I wasn't initially a cannabis
user.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents had owned a nursery and
landscaping business for 20 years at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up around plants but not around
cannabis necessarily, though my father was
[SPEAKER_01]: a pretty big cannabis user I found out
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, when I first started
researching it, I went into my first hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, there was a medical program
but it was pretty small in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no recreational program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking in there, I felt like a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there was a cop waiting around the
corner sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a park down the street sort of
a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no plants in the shop,
which was really weird to me because the
[SPEAKER_01]: shop was geared toward growing plants but
yet there were no plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were all these bottles that had
really cool stickers of fake giant plants
[SPEAKER_01]: or women in scantily clad outfits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like the stuff that my parents
were selling in their garden center at
[SPEAKER_01]: their plant nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, should I be using these
things with my vegetables?
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes these products so unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really excited at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my gosh, I think I've
discovered something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as I started learning more,
I realized I don't need all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, at the time, I couldn't afford them
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to come up with alternative ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that was doing research on
internet forums at the time because there
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't a lot of authoritative information
around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing what other people were having
success with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I feel like social media has turned
into this echo chamber where one company
[SPEAKER_01]: might get pretty big in a given space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone echoes their sentiments and it
becomes very product focused instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily looking at the technology and
figuring out how we can do things more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainably or without using all of these
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what led me to some of these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about going on the WSDA or
the CDFA website, when I go look up the
[SPEAKER_01]: products of some of these companies and
find what information they have around
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals or around NPK or if they're
even registered, that to me was a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: validating or discrediting what I was
seeing on social media because social
[SPEAKER_01]: media can be very convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy, I think, to go to a social
media, an Instagram account or YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: page and see all the people echoing and
commenting and validating what the person
[SPEAKER_01]: is saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it on my pages too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't unique to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that provides a very
authoritative or reputable credential in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of what's actually being shared into
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing your experience too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a journey that we have to go on to
figure out how to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whole new skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this day and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that we can share with each other
tips, the easier that this gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that I discovered
too was by going to graduate school,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I was studying special
education, I was forced to read a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them were on behavioral
techniques and things around education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to, I think, some of the stuff
that you studied in your educational
[SPEAKER_01]: journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't so much about the research that
I read, but it was about learning how to
[SPEAKER_01]: read these papers and understanding what
conclusions I can really draw from them
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other issue that I see is people will
read a paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this in the news all the time with
these sensationalized headlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will take a research paper and then
draw all of these health implications or
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation decisions around things that
the research really wasn't saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really interesting thing
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be so careful with news
articles about cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like you said, first of all,
the titles are so sensationalized and
[SPEAKER_00]: overblown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, they might not be pointing out
those red flags or those issues with the
[SPEAKER_00]: study, or they might be interpreting the
results in ways that are not appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: or not associated with the scale that was
done with the study itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote by Dr. Peter Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the people that I did
consult with through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote from a book that he wrote
that I thought really well encapsulated
[SPEAKER_00]: this unique problem with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll share this with you because I
really like this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Unfortunately, due to its
polemicized history, cannabis is not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the category of regular science,
where you just give the benefit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt and trust that everything's kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, you always have to look
beyond the headlines, read the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: study, check on the references,
try to discern the perhaps unconscious
[SPEAKER_00]: agenda of the researchers, and take note
of the social context in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: research is being performed, as well as
its funding source and the affiliation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even being able to read these papers and
be able to glean the information from them
[SPEAKER_00]: and to evaluate the research because not
all cannabis research is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very, very high-quality
research that's being done, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some low-quality research that's being
done that's also being published in
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to us as consumers of
information to have these evaluation
[SPEAKER_00]: skills and to make these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot depend on other people to be
doing this for us because it leaves us
[SPEAKER_00]: astray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate, but that is the case
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this on the cultivation side around
products or concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I grew up around the aerated
compost team.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad started an aerated compost team.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compost tea business was one of the
very first people doing this when it first
[SPEAKER_01]: was a thing with the Soul Food Web and Dr.
Ingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research around it was very mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one side, you had Dr. Ingham
sharing all this research of how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressing disease and having all these
benefits, and it's a miraculous silver
[SPEAKER_01]: bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the other side, you had someone
like Dr. Linda Chalker-Scott saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea is snake oil and it doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both had research to support what
they were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I think all the research
around this topic is not good because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about a biological entity
that's constantly changing and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate because of the fact that this
microbiology is going to be different in
[SPEAKER_01]: every brew, so there's no way you can have
a good control around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting how research can be
spun to either support or discredit a
[SPEAKER_01]: topic or a technology, in this case,
aerated compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think either side is totally right
in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the middle ground is really where
this lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a matter of going through and
looking at the methodology that they used.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they brew the tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants were they applied to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and gave a talk to a group of
landscapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifteen years ago and Dr. Linda
Chalker-Scott was one of the speakers
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She shared a trial that she was talking
about for why she was recommending wood
[SPEAKER_01]: mulches in gardens and it was based on a
trial that she did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that wood mulches are
bad, but in the trial, she only had 10
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and she didn't know the name of the
plant that she used.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of me of applying this concept
broadly across all of landscaping in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case, it wasn't authoritative enough or
the methodology wasn't strong enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to feel like you could make that chop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there further research to support this
that other people have done where they've
[SPEAKER_01]: used a variety of plants or where they've
used different mulches?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I'd start to look into does
this have credibility, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people really are doing this
process and looking beyond social media
[SPEAKER_01]: for their answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are even this podcast or other
sources of information as credible as they
[SPEAKER_01]: may sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said with our biases,
I try to apply my bias to this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: when I think about what sort of people I
have on the podcast or what sort of topics
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know it's not perfect and like I
said before, I've made multiple mistakes
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course because I've done over 100
podcasts now and some of them I absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: know had bias and we're sharing
information that I no longer feel is
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily current in our body of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that speaks to all of this is a
journey and it's all a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast has been your learning
process too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to echo what you mentioned about
not putting all of your trust in one
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember one study is just one
study and different studies vary in
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a poor quality study.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely don't want to put your
trust all in that one study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much better to look at the whole of
the field, look at all of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: research that has been done and put it all
together because like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things tend to be much more complex than
we think that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just are looking at one study,
you're looking at a very simplified,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a simplified methodology or study
system or like you said, maybe there's
[SPEAKER_00]: only a few plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at a larger breadth of studies
and seeing how they relate to one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's I think a really important aspect
of getting closer and closer and closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is in store at UBC in
terms of this course?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, let's talk about what do you
feel like your students really took away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the course when you went back and
really evaluated it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were your thoughts about the first
time through?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was really fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go in wanting students to leave
with a lot of information like that was
[SPEAKER_00]: not important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted them to shift their
mindset about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted them to be able to think about it
in a more holistic, more complex way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were able to do that by all of
different topics that we covered by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at different sources, really
interrogating where information is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from, looking at things in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I could get a sense for if
their mindset was shifting about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: was at the very beginning of the course,
I had them respond to three statements and
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to respond to it based on a
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first statement was, the spectrum was
between 0 to 100, 0 being cannabis has no
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and 100 was cannabis has lots of
benefits can be used for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to pick a number between 0 and
100 between that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one I gave them was 0 to 100,
0 being cannabis has no harms and then 100
[SPEAKER_00]: was cannabis is very harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to pick a number and explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last one I gave them was 0 to
100, 0 was cannabis has legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because I'm in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is federally legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0 was cannabis legalization has been
negative for society and then 100 was
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization has been positive
for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to choose a number and explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the numbers they chose at the
beginning of class and the numbers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they chose at the end of class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really interesting to see
their perspectives change and to see their
[SPEAKER_00]: explanations become much more
comprehensive, much more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were struggling a lot more with
really finding a number because they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater understanding of the complexity
and the nuance associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my overall goal to shift their
mindset because we've been exposed to so
[SPEAKER_00]: much negative messaging and we tend to
have a limited understanding of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the messaging that we have come
across throughout our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having the ability to expand our
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the more you know, the closer it
gets you to the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a more messy truth, but it gets you
closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in theory with this exercise,
the point is not necessarily for their
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to move in one direction or
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for them to be to make a more
educated choice for how they would measure
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were your findings, though,
if you're open to sharing?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did sort of average them out,
what direction did they move on their
[SPEAKER_01]: answers from where to where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first one about the benefits of
cannabis, they shifted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they shifted towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: More benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: More benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the harms, they shifted down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one ended the course saying like
zero cannabis has zero harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they shifted their conception of the
harmful aspect of cannabis down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the last one, as far as
society, there was a slight shift towards
[SPEAKER_00]: it being positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that came from, you know,
we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide use and heavy metals and things
that are now being regulated because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the legalization of cannabis, which is
positive for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these sociological
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are not going to prison
for this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And families are not dealing with all the
fallout of the criminal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I realized early on that students
were coming in with very, very negative
[SPEAKER_00]: views of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them in one of the first
assignments to really reflect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: messages that they had received about
cannabis throughout their lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in school, from family,
from religious institutions, from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, media, the news and movies and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were coming in with very negative
connotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense to me because of,
you know, the bias that they were bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in, the negative biases that they were
bringing in based on all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different messages that they had received
throughout their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That like that makes sense to me as you
learn more that their understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits would increase as they were
exposed to positive messaging to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: that out and their understanding of the
harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not as harmful as maybe
they had been taught to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting the demographic that
would choose to take a course in called
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology of cannabis that maybe
necessarily was skewed towards thinking of
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a harmful, negative thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was quite surprised by that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking why I'm curious why you
took this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're coming in, you know, with some
negative feelings about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it just speaks to just how
interesting, how fascinating can cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is and why it was such a, you know,
effective, beautiful vehicle to use to get
[SPEAKER_00]: students to understand biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're couching it within this
within something that maybe they have
[SPEAKER_00]: negative feelings about, but they're still
very interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you see this course continuing at
UBC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would love to see it continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be co-teaching it with my
co-course creator, the person,
[SPEAKER_00]: the research faculty who helped me create
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be co-teaching it in January in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it will at least have one more
offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate you sort of sharing your
findings and process with us here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for sharing as well,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your processes and, you know,
what you've sharing, what you've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: over time is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just I'm so honored to be on this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
