[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to say thank you to
everyone who has tuned into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you have been listening
since the very beginning and others are
[SPEAKER_00]: still just finding the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate when folks reach out
directly or leave a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do read them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mention us to friends or on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big thank you to those of you who
have been able to support us on Patreon as
[SPEAKER_00]: we fired that back up and got new and
exclusive content for subscribers on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's podcast is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to the Andrew Huberman
podcast lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a neuroscientist and professor at
Stanford University and he does a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of podcasts related to human health that
are worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, in addition to his regular podcast
interviews, he does this extra series
[SPEAKER_00]: where he answers listener questions and
talks more in depth about a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 15 to 20 minutes of these
podcasts, which he calls Ask Me Anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: are available for free on the podcast
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can subscribe to his premium
channel if you want to hear the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have found that in the course of
all my interviews, I sometimes find topics
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to talk about more in depth or
share a deeper opinion on than I get to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the flow of the podcast changes
direction or it just doesn't fit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: context of the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless of the reason, I thought a
format like this would allow me to both
[SPEAKER_00]: share more information on the podcast as
well as further support and provide value
[SPEAKER_00]: to the listeners who currently support our
Patreon channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I found that in some of my earlier
interviews, the information has changed or
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not agree with everything that was
shared by a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow me to go share an
alternative viewpoint or perspective on a
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me a long time now to vet guests
for the show, and while I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: release podcasts more frequently,
I'd rather focus on quality content rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the spirit of this new idea,
I'll be releasing some shorter podcasts on
[SPEAKER_00]: here that will be just me talking about a
particular topic or answering listener
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted questions that I think are
really interesting or deserve to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the topics I know I'd like to
cover already are mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of teas in cultivation like
nutrient teas or compost teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: how water impacts cultivation,
no-till and soil-less media, science-based
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics for growing cannabis, and much
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all going to be additional content
and won't take away from what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: already doing with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise that all the guest interviews I
do outside of Kiss Organics will continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to be free to access on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important to us and a part
of our mission to share and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to give you an update
with what's going on with Kiss Organics
[SPEAKER_00]: and my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finally ready to start growing at my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting the finishing touches on the
HVAC, which Dr. Nadia Saba, aka Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse, gave me feedback on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded that conversation and we did a
video walkthrough and I'll be sharing that
[SPEAKER_00]: here soon too on our YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the electrical done finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other story on why it took
so long and we'll be hand watering most of
[SPEAKER_00]: this first cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is to show the entire process
of cannabis cultivation from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and really share
and talk about what we're doing and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many companies out there right
now that will show you how to grow using
[SPEAKER_00]: only their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I think many of the products
are not necessary and a total waste of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you how to grow amazing
plants with minimal inputs and look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to starting that really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, today's topic for our first
podcast is the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit of a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some quote unquote experts have
taken this concept of microbial nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling or the microbial loop just way too
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this with a lot of methods or
beliefs in the organic gardening world,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's biodynamics, Korean natural
farming, soil food web, mineral balancing,
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture, or some popular living soil
company's methods or ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks get so dogmatic about it,
it becomes part of their identity and it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to feel more like a religion than a
cultivation method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today what I want to focus on is the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we use our knowledge of the soil
food web to improve our gardening or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can microbes really do or not do in
our soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, can they prevent or
eliminate disease or help plants resist
[SPEAKER_00]: pest pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the fungal to bacteria ratio really
matter or play a role in soil health?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard the statistics
before and they're pretty unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: that a mere teaspoon of soil contains over
a billion bacteria, several yards of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hyphae, thousands of protozoa,
and 40 to 50 nematodes or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the soil food web?
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil food web represents the community
of organisms, many of which are
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic, that live in the soil and are
a part of the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is it not the soil food chain?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea being that one organism gets
eaten by another organism and this
[SPEAKER_00]: continues in one direction going from one
trophic level to another and on up the
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason it's called a web is
because of the complexity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, because much of the soil food
web is microscopic, it's been very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to research and fully
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we are constantly learning new
things about how plants and microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: interact in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Jeff Lowenfeld's new book,
Teaming with Bacteria, I had him on here
[SPEAKER_00]: as a guest if you want to learn more on
this topic, discusses new research from
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. James White on rhizophagy,
particular bacteria called endophytes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to move into the plant roots,
shed their cellular walls, release
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to the plant, and then move back
out of the root hair tips into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: reform their cellular walls where they can
obtain nutrients from the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then potentially repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we had no knowledge of
until 2008 when some researchers at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Queensland discovered a
relationship between a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, a non-pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and a fungi Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, also known by most people as
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer's yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil food web is a dynamic,
constantly changing ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the concept is relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants take in sunlight in the form of
photosynthesis and convert this to a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different substances,
which are then excreted as root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These exudates are comprised of sugars,
amino acids, organic acids, vitamins,
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These exudates not only feed symbiotic
bacteria and archaea, but they work to
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress pathogens by attracting
microorganisms that are antagonistic to
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exudates can adjust the pH of the
rhizosphere, a fancy word for the area
[SPEAKER_00]: around the roots, so the pH can be
buffered into a range that is more
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons why organic
growers can get away with growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: greater pH ranges than, say, a hydroponic
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is releasing nutrients to
feed the microbes in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: These exudates are being consumed by the
bacteria and archaea in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaea are single-celled organisms that
initially were classified as bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: originally discovered in deep sea vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to survive in places where
no life was thought to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know they exist everywhere,
not just in the soil and the ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even in our stomachs and on our skin,
and have a variety of roles very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from here on out, when I mention
bacteria, you can safely assume that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about archaea, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to the soil food web,
though, these bacteria are essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming the root exudates, and then some
of what they excrete back into the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-available nutrients, meaning it's in
an ionic form like phosphate or nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrate, identical to what we are adding
when we use chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of these bacteria are being eaten
by larger microorganisms like
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria-feeding nematodes or flagellates
or ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bacteria-feeding nematode can feed on up
to 5,000 bacterial cells per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is six and a half times their own
body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they then poop out or excrete is
plant-available nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is called the microbial loop,
or referred to as nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in addition to all of this,
bacteria and fungi play major roles as
[SPEAKER_00]: primary decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release enzymes to break down organic
matter into inorganic forms so that these
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and molecules can be released and
recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how composting works and why
organic matter is so important to soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking it a step further, when organic
matter becomes humus, it is a more stable
[SPEAKER_00]: form of organic matter, and it is no
longer identifiable as to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: original source of organic matter was,
whether it was leaf litter, a dead animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: or an old shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopically, it's been broken down to
be indistinguishable, but organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: and humus is probably its own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big takeaways are that one,
the soil food web is complex and dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: and constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, it's the primary way a plant receives
nutrients in an organic system called
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three, these microbes have roles in
protecting the plant from pathogens and
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, creating soil structure,
and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil food web and microbes in
general are very important in our soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and soilless media when we are cultivating
using a method like living soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which technically is not a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to understate how
important the soil food web is to healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's crucial and all my gardening
practices take into account how they would
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the microbes in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this was not meant to be
exhaustive or comprehensive explanation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web, but I wanted to give
you a foundation that would help explain
[SPEAKER_00]: why I don't subscribe to everything that's
being put out there by folks calling
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves soil food web consultants and
what I think the limits are to what
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes can consistently and reliably
offer us in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the basic
concepts or practices we can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage and support the soil food web in
our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining optimal moisture levels is the
absolute most important thing you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: for microbial life and activity in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is so critical to not just plants
and animals, but to microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, microbes have strategies for dealing
with drought, such as insisting or going
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to keep nutrients cycling,
then we want to keep the microbes alive
[SPEAKER_00]: and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are watering your plants
correctly, this is really not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If soil is just sitting without a plant in
it, then I tell folks to still treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: like it has a plant and keep watering it
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does dry out, say in a bed or a pot,
then I suggest adding a handful or two of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic alfalfa meal or watering with a
tablespoon per gallon of water with
[SPEAKER_00]: unsulfured blackstrap molasses,
something to get the microbes more active
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you remember that your soil
or soil mix is alive and treated as such,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is using high quality
compost or earthworm castings without
[SPEAKER_00]: going too deep as it's deserving of its
own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that you want to use compost or
castings that are high in biological
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and overall microbial biomass,
but also with a balanced mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways of testing for some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't think that all compost is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get in a lot of trouble for
using bad compost, either that's not fully
[SPEAKER_00]: composted or may contain things that you
don't want, like herbicides or pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: that have not fully broken down in the
composting process, or even things like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds, which can be really annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost can also contain harmful
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding what the inputs are and
how it's made is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to trust your source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last thing I'd like to
highlight is soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilling soils can be very destructive to
soil structure and soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when I think it's
necessary to till, but let's not confuse
[SPEAKER_00]: tilling with a mechanical tiller to what
we may have to do in a bed with digging in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole blog on this topic on our
website if you want to read more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some soil disturbance may be
beneficial to the ecology of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all disturbance is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has benefits too, like the potential to
encourage microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that microbes play a big role in
soil structure and we want to support that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and if you can, always keep a plant in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will encourage healthy microbial
communities due to the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between the plant and its ability to
continue contributing to nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned in the beginning of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is any of this controversial?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems pretty straightforward,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that I shared above has been
established and is generally accepted by
[SPEAKER_00]: soil scientists universally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where it gets a bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was the first part of
my podcast on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you found it interesting and
apologies for the vocal quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recovering from COVID as I record this
and I'm still a bit stuffed up and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear the full podcast,
the rest of it is available on our Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: channel where you can sign up for as
little as five dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ton of benefits,
including monthly hangouts with the KISS
[SPEAKER_00]: crew, extra podcast content, immediate
podcast release and many other perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it by searching for the
podcast name or under our company name
[SPEAKER_00]: KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast and I'm your host,
