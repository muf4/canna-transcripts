[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast is all about blue
mats, a unique way to irrigate your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue mats use no electricity and are an
affordable way to improve the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using them in our greenhouse beds
and have helped many growers in setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: custom systems for their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to the show, send us an

you get a setup for yourself or just send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email through our website contact
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Steve Troy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve is a longtime gardener and has been
around cannabis for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the North American distributor for
blue mats and he is here to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: insight in how blue mats work and how to
properly use them in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time
today to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good talking to you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I wanted to start off and give
listeners a little bit of a background
[SPEAKER_00]: into your life history before we start
talking about blue mats and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you share a little bit more about what
kind of path you went on that led you down
[SPEAKER_00]: to starting Sustainable Village?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess it starts back in the early
days of the 60s, like the mid 1960s,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a Peace Corps type program in a
remote part of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no power or running water or
anything in the village where I was
[SPEAKER_01]: staying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked on projects there, including
aquaponics and kind of fish farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: sanitation projects and energy projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just was really interesting and
kind of started me on a whole life path of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that were environmental,
energy saving, appropriate technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much I've been doing it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned to me before we started
the podcast that you've actually been
[SPEAKER_00]: running small businesses or starting
businesses for almost 60 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a little bit more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think since the mid 1950s, probably,
I've started probably 55 or 60 different
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that path lead you to blue
mats?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, as part of the Back to the
Land movement in the late 60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living in the Bay Area and Berkeley
and San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a whole big movement up
north to Mendocino and Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was part of that and moved up to
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my first marijuana farm in 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just really intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I became a partner in a natural
food store up there in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like a cultural center
because back in those days, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: real contrast conflict between the kind of
younger, more counterculture people and
[SPEAKER_01]: the old loggers and conservative people
that were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our natural food store kind of became
kind of a community center in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would always ask us to get
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, it was real interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main way people made money then
was growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had all these customers coming
in, buying grains and herbs and torn
[SPEAKER_01]: jeans, barefooted torn t-shirts and under
dollar bills kind of falling out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets as they would walk up and down the
aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'd say, Hey, can you get us
some drip tubing or how about some organic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some rock phosphate and some
granite dust and some bat guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started getting all these things
for people, deer fencing, irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started another store called Open Circle
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all just, I think it might've
been the first store oriented towards
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first one I've ever heard of or
knew about at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started doing all kinds of
products for grower suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just, it was just going
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we started another store in Willard,
another store in Ukiah, and then one in
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was all just, we're just on
this really steep, fast growing curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the war on drugs started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first it was pretty mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't pull a few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't keep the rest and it was no
big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they started becoming soldiers on
helicopters and really serious bad news
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started, in those days,
we sell miles and miles of poly pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: tubing to go from creeks and springs to
people's gardens, remote gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they started using the
helicopters, they started following the
[SPEAKER_01]: water lines to find out where people's
gardens were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I first discovered blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with an idea of instead of having
these kind of telltale breadcrumb,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs going to the
gardens and people could just put a 55
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon drum under some trees and then just
go up there every week or two and fill it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and have blue mats water their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how blue mats first started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, I think around 1979,
1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been doing this for a long time
and the blue mat technology has changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, over the last few decades,
but can you talk a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: what blue mats are?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't something that you invented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the, as I understand it,
you're the North American distributor for
[SPEAKER_00]: this product, but it comes out of,
is it Austria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're manufactured in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit more about what
they are and?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're basically, yeah,
they're basically just a really
[SPEAKER_01]: inexpensive product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inexpensive tensiometer that
moisture, soil moisture sensing connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to a little valve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's manual and inexpensive compared to
tensiometers and electronic valves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they basically turn the water on and
off based on whatever moisture level you
[SPEAKER_01]: set them for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just prevents the soil from being
too wet or too dry automatically without
[SPEAKER_01]: timers or batteries or electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our listeners who haven't heard of
blue mats, I just want to clarify this a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are essentially, it looks like a
little kind of, we call them carrots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they look kind of like a carrot and
they have a little knob on top that's
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustable and a ceramic tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ceramic tip works, as you
mentioned, as a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it measures the moisture tension in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on where you set that
adjustable nozzle, it determines whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not that device, the blue mat is going
to release more water out into the drip
[SPEAKER_00]: line or retain water if it's too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an automatic watering system that
uses no electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely mechanical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you would add to
that definition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it helps that I always think
of it a little bit like a valve attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to a piston like in a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of the piston going up and
down, the water goes up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're filled with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the soil around the ceramic tip
starts to dry out, it pulls that water
[SPEAKER_01]: down a little bit, which takes the
pressure off of the valve and opens the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the water gets down and it gets
moist again, it stops that pull and closes
[SPEAKER_01]: the valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard that analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would someone go about using this
technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this carrot that's hooked up
to a drip line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this blue mat, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many drippers or how much drip tape or
something would you be able to use per
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot or per blue mat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they make a really huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go anywhere from just a few drops
a minute to many gallons a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideal way is to put the pot or the
bed or whatever you're trying to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it at the moisture level that you
think is the best and then set it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important because otherwise if you
set them when the soil is too wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it keeps it too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set it when it's too dry,
then it keeps it too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideal way to use them is to get
your planting mix or your bed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture level you want to maintain and
then just set it and it keeps it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think that's a big advantage
to these blue mat systems versus other
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're spending tens of thousands
of dollars on an automatic system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning off of tensiometers,
most people are just putting in a drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system and then regulating it by computer
or turning it on and off manually
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves or putting it on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage of the blue mat is it
regulates that moisture content and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintains it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's this myth in the canvas
industry that these wet-dry cycles are
[SPEAKER_00]: really good for your plant, but if we're
talking about organic soil where the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are cycling nutrients and making
those nutrients plants available,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal environment for these microbes
is really soil that's at optimal moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think watering is one of the
most important things in your garden and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it gets underappreciated for how
much it can affect yield and the health of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant and also reduce plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a really good point you
brought up regarding the fact that these
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mats maintain that moisture content
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other advantages to these
blue mat systems over a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system or drip system that you
want to highlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd say what you just described is
really beneficial for organic growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially living soil techniques where
you really need to maintain an even
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture level because if it gets too wet
or too dry, the microbes and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: officials can go dormant and stop working.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in conventional systems or not
organic systems, if the soil gets too wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, it stops the transpiration
because pumps kind of work on a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of physics principle as the blue mats
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pull the moisture and the nutrients
in the roots up into the leaves and for
[SPEAKER_01]: that to work right, it's similar to what I
described with the blue mats there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the soil is too wet, it prevents
that pull, that transpiration pull and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, even if there's plenty of
nutrients in the soil, it won't go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over watering is something I think
people in general don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody had the kind of the
traumatic experience of a plant dying
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't give it enough water
and so there's a tendency to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: overcompensate and give too much water and
there's definitely some really big
[SPEAKER_01]: drawbacks to the soil being too wet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you can dial in that
moisture content where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also use your digital moisture
meters as a quick and easy way to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture reading so that we can quantify
what we like our soils at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for us, we like to keep our soils
right around 100 m bar, which I know is
[SPEAKER_00]: wetter than most traditional soils,
even cannabis soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what your media is that
you're growing is, you can determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: that optimal moisture content level is
using a moisture meter and then take that
[SPEAKER_00]: information and set up your blue mats
around that, around an actual number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just guessing at what
optimal moisture is, you can actually set
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which to me is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you can kind of dial in
based on the kind of growing method you
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we usually recommend in veg to keep it
between 120 and 150 m bars and any flower
[SPEAKER_01]: between 150 and 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing organics, especially
living soil, you're not just thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the plant roots, but you're thinking
about the whole soil mixture and the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and micro-residue and all the
different beneficials are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping it more moist, especially if
you're using a mulch and you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the mulch needs to be moist enough
for the earthworms to be able to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times people will keep it even
more moist than 100, even 80 to 90 if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using like a living soil kind of
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's important to note that I
always confuse these in my head,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the millibars, as you go lower in
numbers, like you said, towards 80 or 90,
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil gets more moist or wetter and as
the number goes up, goes higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually, the soil is drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, for me, that's a hard
connection to make, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important people realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of intuitively people tend to
think the other way around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to keep a couple moisture
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing commercially,
as in you're making a living on your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I like to have at least two or three
or more digital moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case one fails or I have anything go
off, I have a redundant see there just in
[SPEAKER_00]: case, because the digital moisture meters
are electronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having something to check your
results on, I think is really handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just another suggestion I like to
throw out to people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some customers that use one per
each plant, but that gets pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's good to have one at least
for each different size pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have some plants in five gallon
and you have some plants in 30 gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good to have a moisture meter one
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can move them around, but it takes
about five or 10 minutes to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate reading after you move one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a budgetary thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's most convenient to have one per
plant, but if the budget's not there,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just have to be a little bit more
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can take one and move it from
place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you can't go, let's say the
blue mats are out of your budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: then even getting a digital moisture meter
so that you can start to dial in your
[SPEAKER_00]: watering habits is another way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to caution people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had this problem in the past is that
the top of the digital moisture meter is
[SPEAKER_00]: not waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to water over the top of
it or it can break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we've learned
the hard way, as you know, with these
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to let people know ahead of
time in case they do pick one up and start
[SPEAKER_00]: using one in their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you noticed, but we have a
cap that goes on the top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use it to prevent that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to start ordering that with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only, I think, $2 retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can even use them outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter if it rains or water
gets on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just protects the electronics in the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to order some of those
for you for the moisture meters that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I learned something today there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit more about the
actual usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of these blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come in a couple of different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have what you're calling, I believe,
the regular size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a Maxi, which is a
larger carrot, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about when you might use
those two systems or those two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually have about five
different sizes or types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the five inch and the nine inch
you just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also make a 16 inch size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we make for really big pots and
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have a small one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it a bonsai mat, but it's real
short and stubby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can put that in really small
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another one that we call
a surface glue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got about a three inch base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really handy for starts and
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do capillary mat systems with
that, which are just starting to get
[SPEAKER_01]: popular in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really common and popular in
Europe, but it's a really inexpensive way
[SPEAKER_01]: of watering a whole lot of small starts
and clones and anywhere up to like a one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon or so size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a general rule, I've always used
the regular blue mat size, the five inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only gone up to the nine inch if
I have more than a foot of depth in my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of been my general rule for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have guidelines that you like to
give listeners or people regarding them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we usually use just the small ones
up to 10 gallon size pot and then a 10
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, well at least 10 and 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use one of each because if it's
that deep, then it's kind of nice to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're monitoring both the top half
of the planting mix and the bottom half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big difference between the two is
where that ceramic tip is sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the max, he obviously reaches deeper
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be measuring your water,
your moisture content at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever seven or eight inches instead of
the other one, which is measuring,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing around three or four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing you can do with the big
ones is you can put them in horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have like, especially if it's like
a hundred gallon or even 50 gallon sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's really deep, you can put it
horizontally and then you can sense the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture at any level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we experiment with that and
didn't have as great of success because
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the challenges we had with these
blue mats is if you bump them at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you bumped the line attached to them,
it can throw off the sensor and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start, they think that the moisture
content is low and so they'll start just
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing out water and pushing out water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't want to, if you're going
to put them in horizontally, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have it sticking out into a
walkway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then people will bump it and you
get a runaway really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do it horizontally, it's better
to position it on a side where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: walk in between so you don't have that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about some of
the potential problems you might have with
[SPEAKER_00]: a blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those, I just briefly
mentioned, but I, you know, I've used blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats myself in my test garden and I've
flooded a couple of pots because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: make that good connection there in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that when
you're putting in the blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carrots themselves into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the most important things to
watch out for, I guess, is if there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of perlite, especially the big chunky
perlite or volcanic rock or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really porous like that in the
soil, if that's touching the ceramic tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make the blue mat think it's dry
when it's not really and get a runaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's a pretty easy thing to
prevent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just take some peat moss or cocoa
and put it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as long as there's something in
between the volcanic rock or perlite and
[SPEAKER_01]: the sensor, then it avoids that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of the same thing with rock wool or
other kinds of media like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to have something that will
prevent that fake out for the blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking it's dry when it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think also making sure,
like you mentioned, that all of your lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else are not in walkways or
areas that they could get bumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you bump it, now you're
potentially moving a spot of the ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: tip that's now touching air and creates
that same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's a really easy fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't know it, then you don't
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you bump the carrot, then if you
don't do anything, you get a runaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just push the soil down around
it, just to make sure that there's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: connection between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ceramic tip and the potting mix that
prevents it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's happened,
if I can go on this, is like, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: probably doing tech support, probably 80
to 90% of the problems we hear come from
[SPEAKER_01]: people doing gravity systems and
forgetting to refill the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because if you catch it right away,
then it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just refill the reservoir and you're
still going good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it stays dry for too long,
the water in the carrot can get sucked
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it depends on how quickly you
catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you catch it pretty fast, then you can
just refill the carrot and you're good to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it goes for too long at the time,
it gets too dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just fill it up, it won't work
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it dries out for too long,
you need to soak it again and get started
[SPEAKER_01]: again or else you can have that kind of
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard of that, but then I'm not
dealing with as many Blumat customers as
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how you mentioned soaking the ceramic
tip portion prior to setting up your
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go into sort of what that process
looks like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing that I think can really
avoid the problem you described too is
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that the water that you put
the carrot that you soaked the carrot in
[SPEAKER_01]: and fill it with doesn't have any
dissolved oxygen in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of times cities,
I mean, it's different in different
[SPEAKER_01]: places, but a lot of times cities will use
oxygen to pressurize their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you fill the carrot with that
dissolved oxygen, it will over the course
[SPEAKER_01]: of a few days form bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's just a few bubbles,
it's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of increases the on-off cycle
when it turns on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when it turns it off,
but if there's too many air bubbles in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, then you can get a runaway and it
just won't turn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I always like to do is boil the
water first and then let it cool and then
[SPEAKER_01]: use that water to fill the carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you're assured that there's
not a dissolved oxygen that will create
[SPEAKER_01]: air bubbles and change your setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was setting up my system,
I didn't do that, but I let it sit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water for I think two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think allowed a lot of the oxygen
to be removed from the water, but I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, it's not a lot of
water that we're talking about because
[SPEAKER_00]: these carrots are not huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wouldn't be a big deal to throw a
pot on the stove and boil a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: water to soak them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't take long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the basic thing for soaking them,
it's kind of gone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to think you needed to soak them
for at least an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we've discovered and the factory
has confirmed that you really only need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it for 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to do it 10 or 15 minutes,
both with it in two piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you screw it together under
water, you need to soak it for another 10
[SPEAKER_01]: or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just soak it for a long time,
screw it on and then use it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have another little 10 minutes
or something in there for things to
[SPEAKER_01]: equalize inside the carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're going to soak the carrots
and then attach the top part, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: the valve on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be photos and everything on
the podcast page for people who and design
[SPEAKER_00]: information, everything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll screw on the top of the carrot
under water so that we're not getting any
[SPEAKER_00]: air bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, that one,
that particular blue mat is ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can put it right into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need to soak it again for
another 10 minutes after you screw it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideal minimum is to take it apart,
soak it under water for 10 or 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: and take a pipette or a dropper and
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little few air bubbles inside
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three little holes in the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you squeeze the pipette into that,
those air bubbles come out and then screw
[SPEAKER_01]: it together and then wait 10 or 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that's done, you can leave it in
the water for weeks or even longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime you need it, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then we take that carrot and we
can push it down into the soil wherever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we want to be monitoring the
moisture tension around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure to push it all the way down
till the cap is the only thing exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that mistake on one of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't push it all the way into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an important thing to
point out, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that kind of depends on,
I guess, a lot of on the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in some places, especially if people
are going to transplant from a small pot
[SPEAKER_01]: into a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they want to use the long carrots,
but they don't want to get one for the
[SPEAKER_01]: small one and one for the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just put a long carrot,
a nine inch one into a small pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a two or three gallon or even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then just put when it maybe it's
only halfway pushed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they put it into a bigger
pot, push it further.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that that works in places where
there's high humidity, but in places where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's drier, then that will you'll suck
some of the water out of the carrot if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's exposed like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it depends on the temperature,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if we then put the carrot into the
soil and hooked up all the main line to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, the 10 millimeter line, we then can
once the whole system is set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we then have that valve on top that we can
open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about how that
process works with you already mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the soil to field capacity or
whatever your optimal moisture content is
[SPEAKER_00]: for that soil before as you go to dial in
the system, can you talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about what that looks like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, the standard suggestion is to
open up the top until the water is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out and then dial it down until there's
just a hanging drop and then down one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two more of the little triangles that are
circled by a little cap on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also depends a little bit on the
kind of planting mix people have and the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of growing method they have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we like we talked before about
living for you and if you want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: more of the pot moist and then maybe you
wouldn't turn it down at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just just go at the hanging drop
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if there's more sand and perlite
and things that have more drainage,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you might want to keep it a little
bit more open too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's something with more
capillary action in the soil mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you might want to turn it down a
little bit more because it will spread out
[SPEAKER_01]: by itself more evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's there's different rules
of thumb ideas, but every situation is
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperature and the humidity in the
room and the kind of plant and how fast
[SPEAKER_01]: things are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's basically needs to be
customized to the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that digital moisture meter,
I think, comes in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we with our soil, what I did was
exactly what you described is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I put the carrot in,
I watched till that dry would start
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping and then I would turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would slowly close that valve on top
until that drip was just hanging right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would turn it back one notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's after I've gotten the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it after I've watered the soil to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wait a few hours until I have
it at, you know, evenly homogeneous and at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture content I want it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go through that process of
going down and dialing and all the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the ideal way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I think that's kind of
good to know is if people don't do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they put it in when the soil is too wet or
too dry and then they want to adjust it
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to not do that too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make it drier or make it a little
bit more wet, you don't need to turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: very much because it's like a 24 hour
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to watering all at one time
pretty much, even with a drip system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you see coming out,
you kind of gauge by how much you turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with blue mats, because it's this long
term thing, if you want to make it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little wetter or drier, it's good to maybe
only do two or three of those little lines
[SPEAKER_01]: in between the triangles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you kind of go from being too
dry to doing too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're kind of always going back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find that middle ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can definitely start playing
around with it and make the situation a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times,
too, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you said, it's just micro
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what those notches on top are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the on the top of the valve and to make
it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have it dialed in, I have to say
it works exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's fun to walk into the room and
see that some of the blue mats are
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and some of them are depending on
the particular plant and stage of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and different cultivars in the room will
all require different water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really optimizes for each plant in
each container or each bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a customer a few years ago that had
just some plants, a medical garden in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually went to Alaska to go
fishing and just had his wife refilling
[SPEAKER_00]: the reservoir every day or every couple of
days for his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back and his plants were
actually touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me photos and they were all
burnt on the top canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue was definitely not watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had just overgrown the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing that these things can function
and optimally water without a lot of human
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention and any electricity is really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it saves so much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had probably three or four people
tell me that it saved their marriage or
[SPEAKER_01]: their relationship, that their girlfriends
or their wives were so fed up with them
[SPEAKER_01]: having to be there every day and spend so
much time doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were about ready to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blue mats saved their
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm terrible about remembering to water,
too, if I have a bunch of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll water at my convenience,
not necessarily when the plants need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, though, that I've never
had to rely on a cash crop for my salary,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was growing commercially,
then that would be a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just have a medical garden or
something like that, yeah, it takes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time if you have another job or other
things going on in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you can automate and the more
labor you can save, it more than pays for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, you're reducing the amount of water
you're using, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're there every day,
you're not going to go on vacation for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, there's a lot of better ways
you can spend your time than hand
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, trimming and watching through
bugs or plant things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many more beneficial
things you can spend your time doing than
[SPEAKER_01]: just watering, spending that much time
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's even more of a factor now
with legalization becoming broader and
[SPEAKER_01]: more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with the prices being driven down,
you can't really change much about the
[SPEAKER_01]: selling price.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where you really have leverage is
limiting your costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do something that both saves a
lot on your labor costs and also,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time, increases your yield,
that's kind of a really, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: successful way of dealing with the lower
prices that are out there already and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to be more that way in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, reducing expenses a lot easier
than trying to sell more products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in ways we can reduce our expenses or
put that labor towards more efficient or
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective uses is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, we got cut off at this
point in the conversation and have not had
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to reconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have decided to post the podcast as it
stands and would encourage listeners to
[SPEAKER_00]: email me with any questions they may have
on blue mats or irrigation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can follow up with Steve in another
podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that was Steve Troy, the North
American distributor of blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic watering systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I realize if this is your first time
hearing about blue mats or you've never
[SPEAKER_00]: set up a system before, this can seem a
bit daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it requires a custom setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some examples and photos on our
podcast page to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please shoot me an email through our
kiss organics website contact page and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can help you avoid any mistakes and get
