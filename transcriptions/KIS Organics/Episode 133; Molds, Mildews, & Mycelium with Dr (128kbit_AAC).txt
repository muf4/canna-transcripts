[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is a returning guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nicole Gauthier is a pathologist and
professor and extension specialist at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her program focuses on disease management
of specialty crops, including hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In her extension role, she develops
educational and outreach programs to help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers manage disease through
identification, understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystems, and integration of
management strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research program focuses on a range of
hemp diseases, including Fusarium head
[SPEAKER_00]: blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Gauthier earned her bachelor's of
science in horticultural science and her
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD in plant pathology from Louisiana
State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She joined the UK College of Agriculture
in 2011 and began working with industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link on the podcast page
to access her resources and research in
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the podcast again
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to talk to you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to hear a pathologist's
perspective on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually went back and re-listened
to our last conversation, which was I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a year or two ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some really important
takeaways that I thought growers would
[SPEAKER_00]: find really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you review some of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we just talked about them before
the show, but maybe the especially ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so powdery mildew probably hands down
number one disease on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular in greenhouse greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see powdery mildew in the field and
kind of like the northeast, a lot less so
[SPEAKER_02]: like in the south and southeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out west, it's kind of like in the Pacific
Northwest, we'll see some powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of really depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powdery mildews overall don't like a lot
of heat or not the ones that we see as
[SPEAKER_02]: much in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the greenhouse, we're more of
controlled temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see a lot more powdery mildew
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I digress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So powdery mildew, the primary powdery
mildew that we see in cannabis is a genus
[SPEAKER_02]: Golavinomyces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might see it as Golavinomyces
fidesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Golavinomyces ambrosiae is the
pathogen, the correct name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, in the pathology world,
we always we're always at battle with
[SPEAKER_02]: taxonomus and so Golavinomyces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might hear a couple of different
species there, but it looks like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may hear in the Pacific, the Pacific
Northwest, a little bit of buzz about
[SPEAKER_02]: Potasferia macularis, and that is the hops
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been shown to jump from hops to
cannabis or hemp when they're planted in
[SPEAKER_02]: close proximity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it hasn't become a problem yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's on standby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's watching that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are an indoor cannabis grower
or if your cannabis is located outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: a hops production area, you probably are
dealing with the Golavinomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that you'd mentioned was
the humidity ranges of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that again, too?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know we say kind of in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tend to lump powdery mildews as just
a single a single pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of different powdery
mildews.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of host specific powdery
mildews, the one you see on roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the one you see on crape myrtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the one you see on cucurbits in
your backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one or the ones that the
Golavinomyces that affects cannabis tends
[SPEAKER_02]: to be more of a broad host range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golavinomyces are powdery mildew pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are fungal, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't need free water to complete
their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of our pathogens, we always talk
about free water, free water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means rain, irrigation,
fall, like that physical water that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see on a surface, say on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: But humidity is a different animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start playing with humidity,
so a lot of our pathogens need some level
[SPEAKER_02]: of humidity to be able to sporulate,
that's produce spores, or to infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once infection occurs, none of the rest
matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: High humidity or high temperature can
cause Golavinomyces in this situation to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually produce spores from that leaf,
for example, to produce those spores so
[SPEAKER_02]: those spores can disseminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Golavinomyces, and I'm gonna talk
just about that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know last time we talked about
different powdery mildews, but let's just
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on that one because probably 95% of
what we see is the Golavinomyces ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can infect, it'll need higher humidity
to infect, but to sporulate as low as 40%
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40% is low, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually though, and we talk about 40%
humidity, but usually when we're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: those warmer days, cooler nights where you
start getting that condensation,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you really will get kind of some spikes
in humidity in those cycles of temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see that, especially when we
have those cool nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powdery mildew loves that scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does not like free water,
so the opposite of all of our other plant
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of the moral of the story though
is that powdery mildew is going to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of, it's resilient when it's
drying, or it's resilient when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always picks like a little caveat where
it kind of will infect and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: sporulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It produces lots of spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call those asexual spores, knidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll produce lots of knidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: their wind or air disseminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we call this a disease of mildew
because what we see on the surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of spores, all that fuzzy stuff you
see of mycelia and spores, lots of spores,
[SPEAKER_02]: their wind disseminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a numbers game for that pathogen and
they're everywhere and they fly around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes it the number one
disease of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how far can those spores travel and
what are some other you mentioned it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: generalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some other plants that might be
in the area that would be considerations
[SPEAKER_00]: from a management perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question about how far they can
travel and that it depends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect pathology answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how windy it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the directions of the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely suck it into a
greenhouse through a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could definitely blow around on a
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there are so many spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a numbers game with this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So host range, all of your cucurbit crops,
cucurbit weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so cucurbits are your pumpkins,
cucumbers, watermelons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are lots of cucurbit weeds that
you have outside, outside of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this pathogen in lots of just just
general weeds outside a lot of your
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamentals, some of your forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a it's a pretty wide host range.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of these some of these
weeds or some of these plant species
[SPEAKER_02]: you've probably never heard of,
you know, we don't even have common names
[SPEAKER_02]: for so very wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's there is the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we try to be clean and yes,
we try to be careful like we're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go scout our vegetable garden or play
in our landscape and then walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into our green, our clean greenhouse,
we're not going to do that, but it will
[SPEAKER_02]: come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes it very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to add insult to injury, powdery
mildews, especially the Gola venom,
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not everyone does this, but the Gola
venom, I see, do they will produce at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the season when the plant starts
senescing, they will produce an
[SPEAKER_02]: overwintering structure called
chasmathesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are these are going to be your
overwintering structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're melanitis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them like Velcro balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have appendages and they stick to
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be your sexual spores
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when your crop returns or your your
conditions or spring returns, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to germinate and they're going to
release those sexual spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point there, once it's in your
greenhouse and once chasmathesia develop,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very hard to get rid of them because
they they're lodged in and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: hunkered down for whatever over summering,
overwintering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in my research, greenhouse is
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we went fallow for like two years
and that dorm powdery mildew was back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this chasmathesia, I know we're on
plants when we clean that greenhouse up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, I'm a pathologist,
so I bring disease into my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do really bad things from a research
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once the powdery mildew pathogen is
there, if it has been allowed to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: this chasmathesia, it can be there for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can talk about sanitation later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to highlight something you
said, because like I have a vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: garden just outside here and I grow a
variety of squashes and I do have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was under the impression that it was not
the same species of powdery mildew when,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, what you're telling me is quite
likely it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need to be much I need to have
stronger management practices in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have in the past, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's talk a little bit about what
options we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume physical removal of the
plant or even those leaves would help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce spore pressure potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oils seem to be fairly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with cannabis, we can't use
oils after a certain point in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other management practices do we
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some microbes out there on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so a couple of things is that,
yeah, it probably is the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're learning more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if time and money allowed,
I would do a survey of U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I have this plan in my head
that I would love to see powdery mildews
[SPEAKER_02]: from across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and be able to to be able to really say
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm absolutely sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so it's probably the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of my research counterparts in
other states, they keep reporting the same
[SPEAKER_02]: goal of M.I.C.'s either spidaceous and
brogier, chikoricea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're lumping those all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, can you can you relocate
your cannabis plants or maybe the other
[SPEAKER_02]: side of your house?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what can you do to physically
add space?
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so there is it's just one of those
diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, unfortunately, you will have you
will have it on your squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have it on your pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have it on your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the bad news.
[SPEAKER_02]: More sun, more blistering sun will help
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can physically separate them as
much as possible or give up either the
[SPEAKER_02]: squash or the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm making a joke like it's really
true in terms of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: For management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have found the best results with and I
don't like to use products, but a mill
[SPEAKER_02]: stop plus cease that combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have found really good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have found good results with regalia
and trilogy and whole milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one has to be applied very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we were talking about conventional,
which we cannot use conventional products
[SPEAKER_02]: in in cannabis production, we would have
systemic products that would actually
[SPEAKER_02]: enter the the the plant and would not wash
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with these biologicals, they're
washing off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on where you are,
how much rain you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the application, the time between
applications is it is very short.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of reapplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to do some pruning,
being able to space air circulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start seeing severe powdery mildew
to either get the plants out to salvage
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants or to clip leaves,
depending on how many you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a five thousand square foot
green commercial greenhouse, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to treat it the same as a homeowner
that maybe has two plants in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very different management
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, commercially, I'd be much more
active in my spring because it's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's my viable crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try, try botrystop as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a it's a competitive
Eulacladium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try botrystop as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some possibilities out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to work like a
conventional fungicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for anybody out there listening who
uses conventional fungicides for powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew in other crops, the biologicals are
just not going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in a commercial setting,
sulfur is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, sulfur is nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to put sulfur in after
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sulfur really works well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OMRI listed, but it's not a
biological.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really have a problem in a
greenhouse, that might be a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's been some research using
silica like molastonite, diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, eggsil, potassium silicate to
reduce the prevalence of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any of that research?
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually did some research on using
silicon in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we tracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we we utilize silicon and we tracked it
for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got we got six week excellent
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent management using silicon as a as
a root amendment, as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not really get any good results on
liquid feed, foliar applied silicon
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will link I will send you a link and
maybe you could put it in the description
[SPEAKER_02]: for sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had excellent results with the
silicon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some details on how we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started our plugs and we started it
on a silicon amended media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we bumped those plants up,
it went into another silicon amended
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long we could keep that going?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, we had excellent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will share that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have an apology because I did
a podcast with Dr. Wendy Zeldner,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's a silicon expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I confused I forgot that you
had done you actually did the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one with the last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually talked about that in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, no, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, I know we talked about powder
metal before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's such an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had shared a couple other key
takeaways that I found really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could touch on those
again, one of which was regarding photos
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, do you want to elaborate on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was your information,
so I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is my soapbox a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plant diseases are the plant's reaction
to an infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so there's infection and there are
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So infection is when the pathogen,
that's the fungus or bacterium or virus,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it infects the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be days, weeks, months,
depending on the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you actually see symptoms and it's
those symptoms that we call disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our symptoms can be wilt or leaf curl
or marginal leaf scorch or gliding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the symptom is usually how we name a
plant disease.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a wilt, for example,
I don't know what that infection is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a microscope or I need other
molecular tools or I need to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something else to be able to diagnose
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, and this is where my
soapbox kicks in, is that we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people sharing online and the cannabis
industry has been so closed off for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long that growers had to find a way to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, there's a lot of
misinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just looking at a picture and this is
what I do all day and I cannot look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture and make a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can point you in a direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make some guesses, but there's a lot
more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we start managing and we start
trying to understand, is this a seed borne
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen or is this a pathogen that can
maybe over winter or over summer in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse or what does it take to manage
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have to know exactly what it is
and you have to utilize a diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, dealing with high THC cannabis versus
low THC like hemp, those are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get into the weeds there, but we can't
diagnose by symptoms and symptoms are
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can guess, we can get, you know,
have a head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people listening before we started
recording, Tad and I were talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf that had some galls on it and we're
just kind of bantering back and forth,
[SPEAKER_02]: making some guesses and eliminating some
obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in the end, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same situation for anyone
who sends me a picture or even since their
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnostic lab, a picture, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really be careful of armchair
diagnosticians out there because there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of them and even some real experts
that I follow online have misdiagnosed
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I can look at and say,
oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really rely on a pathologist,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your crop will be much better for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done with my soapbox,
Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, commercially, I think that's
essential because you talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle of these these pathogens can
vary dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to really manage it
properly, we need to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, I was on social
media yesterday and saw a photo someone
[SPEAKER_00]: had posted on Reddit of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you know, in 24 hours,
the plant crashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you see the severe wilting and a
lot of people were saying it was watering
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, this has to be a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it happens that if we see that level of
wilt, it has to be something happening
[SPEAKER_00]: with in the vascular system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what does that narrow it down to for
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are there any treatment options
when we have vascular disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes you'll see just one
branch, for example, just crash on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that really quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, quickly, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk a lot about patterns with with
diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is a plant pathogen, if it's caused
by a pathogen and not abiotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: like environmental or there usually won't
be a pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare that there's a pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually if it's a disease, it's
scattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did those other plants look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just this one plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did this person have more than one plant
right to even make a comparison?
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually if there is a pathogen,
we see some type of symptom coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a home grower or a like a non
pathologist might not notice it as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it is a quick death, indeed,
two things can be happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could definitely be a vascular problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a plant has a really good root system
or like it's raining outside my window
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, if it's raining and we have
root loss or any kind of uptake issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, we can have a crown rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's still a little bit of vascular
tissue functioning, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That phloem is functioning enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it kind of you'll get that balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you might get a hot, sunny day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might suddenly, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go from this raining to 85 degrees and
suddenly that plant's needs are not being
[SPEAKER_02]: met, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that heat and sun and
transpiration has taken an increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that plant can suddenly collapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about sudden collapse,
there's a lot of questions that go with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you really watched?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any patterns?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you more information that I
didn't even think about when I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had three other plants in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those plants look fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all receiving the exact same
amount of water because he was bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: watering two gallons of water per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were fully established plants,
almost finished in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were at least 40 days in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pretty big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he showed a 24 hour change where
the plant just completely.
Wilted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question would have been,
what about 40 hours, 48 hours before?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there some sign or some, some symptom
that, you know, again, most people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was just an attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually the lighting is really hard to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like being outside with a,
with a brighter light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is harder to see their shadows,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, and I look for any kind of wound
or damage or physical damage, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: canker at that crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I always tell my outdoor growers,
if your knees aren't dirty, you haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: looked hard enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to really look, look there and see
what else could it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, could, um, it be any kind of,
you know, just insect, even things like
[SPEAKER_02]: pill bugs are, um, are the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just chew things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my colleagues in the Southeast are
having fire ants eat the crowns of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a million possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be something super quirky,
but it might truly be something vascular
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it is, if it's an indoor
environment, then how would a pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: have gotten in?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using soilless media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be clean, free of any kind of
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are you, how would you have brought
in a Fusarium, uh, Oxidospirum?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you have brought that in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to start asking yourself all
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the likelihood of a new grow indoors in
a clean environment, having a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a, um, vascular pathogen or a root-borne
pathogen are unlikely unless there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: unsanitary situation, uh, going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might answer your question,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perfect because I think it wasn't
so much getting an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hearing your thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think is really
fascinating about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, with the use of compost that may
have not been fully treated, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: one source where Fusarium can come in,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of other cover crops, I think
potentially if transplanted, could have
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if people are using cover crops or
mulches, um.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, any kind of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any kind of soil and compost rarely does
our compost get hot enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, rarely does it get hot enough,
especially with Fusarium Oxidospirum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying thermally it's not treated
hot enough to actually kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To kill, um, so we're doing, we're working
on a solarization project right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, which is a whole nother fascinating
thing, but Fusarium Oxidospirum,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the Fusarium that causes Fusarium
wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of Fusariums by the way,
that can cause disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is so stinking resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just, we are doing these oven
studies as a side project and we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just, we think it's dead and we
leave picture dishes out and it just comes
[SPEAKER_02]: back after 21 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so compost is a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't home compost, make sure you're using
a hot compost from a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you are indeed going to use compost
or you can just take the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, depends if you're a home grower,
you're a hobby grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take those risks all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, commercial growers should never,
ever take those risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about in worm castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you see it in the,
cause those usually aren't thermally
[SPEAKER_00]: composted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm casting should not, no, they wouldn't
be thermally composted, but they should
[SPEAKER_02]: not include, they should be fully,
um, it should be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, what is the starting
material?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they feeding those worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a starting material, not plant
material in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not, you know, when, when,
when we can't figure it out and out an
[SPEAKER_02]: answer, sometimes we start going down
rabbit holes and try to figure out what
[SPEAKER_02]: if, what if, but you know, think,
think of the big common ways that it could
[SPEAKER_02]: have gotten in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you know, was your, did you buy
commercial potting soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it sitting on the ground outside next
to your vegetable garden before you
[SPEAKER_02]: finally brought it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: So think of the big ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, eliminate all of the obvious,
eliminate, um, things you can see like
[SPEAKER_02]: insects, uh, or arthropods, then eliminate
big things like a biotic physical damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I've seen, I've seen people
like planning, um, on plastic,
[SPEAKER_02]: like plastic culture system and just the
plastic rubbing against a very tender
[SPEAKER_02]: stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for physical damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it, you know, so start with
really big, start with a really obvious,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's something that's such a caveat
that we can't really identify it easily,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably never going to happen again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you do suspect, um,
disease, if you do suspect a vascular,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, problem, you could definitely start
doing some cutting and looking at that
[SPEAKER_02]: vascular tissue, um, trying to see if that
really could be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, interestingly enough,
one of the biggest suppliers of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soils in my industry, um, for what living
soil is actually is growing cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, other vegetables on site where they're
mixing soils, which to me seems like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly large risk, um, and vector,
but, um, yeah, I don't know if,
[SPEAKER_00]: if, if it's causing a problem or not,
but I am seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something, something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one, one other thing I was curious
about when you're talking about stems
[SPEAKER_00]: though, getting back to that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, I do sometimes see like a fuzzy
mold growth on, on a stem or people do,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what is that typically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we, how do we deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to save our plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuzzy stem growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, let's go, let's go to
definitions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I see this a lot online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so fungi, um, it's a whole,
you know, broad spectrum, but fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: the body of a fungus is string like,
um, um, hyphae, we call those mycelia or
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycelium is singular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycelia is plural.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's always a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always say mycelia and any fungus in
the body of any fungus is called mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see mycelia, there is no way
that you know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands, hands down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so just because there's mycelia
present, you have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, um, it could be a decomposer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a saprophite just decomposing
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it could be pathogenic or it could be
something like, and rarely do we see,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, mycorrhizal, um, mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're, they're really thin and
spindly and they're not that big fluffy
[SPEAKER_02]: white mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are different kinds of,
um, growth patterns of a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have mycelia growing on a stem
on a unhealthy plant and not indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it could very well be a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sclerotinia or, um, a white rot or,
um, or a lot of, there are a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, there are a lot of common names,
um, white rot or timber rot, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: white mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a cool season, um, disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in the south, southeast,
we have southern blight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's later in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is agroethelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will make a, um, that will make a
mycelia, mycelial mat on the base of a
[SPEAKER_02]: stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It quickly cankers and that plant will
die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a correlation between when you
see that and the plant dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, most of the time when we see mycelia
that are not affiliated with a,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, crown rot or stem rot pathogen,
it's usually something, some decomposed or
[SPEAKER_02]: some saprophyte.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, something people feed a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feed compost and compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feed molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feed all of these things that are
simply, um, contributing to the population
[SPEAKER_02]: of these sap, saprophytes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so those mycelia, the mycelia you
see can be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't mean your soil is
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're feeding it, it doesn't mean
it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an indication of really nothing,
um, except that maybe you've put molasses
[SPEAKER_02]: in your, in your soil is medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should not have anything growing in a
soil is medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So potting soil, you shouldn't have
anything growing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's, you know, it's,
it comes in like, um, not sterile,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, you know, it doesn't have compost
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's usually just a spag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you're growing, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I just wanted to highlight a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the people that listen to the
podcast and a lot of growers nowadays are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what people call living soils where
they add a compost fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those cases, when we add a food
source, alfalfa meal, oat flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: any, any fertilizer, really plant
fertilizer, we're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see this saprophytic fungi,
what you're saying is it's not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator of, of anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just an airborne fungi or
something that was in that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's good, bad,
most likely innocuous, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the more you feed it,
the more it'll grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not doing anything for your
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so a lot of these, a lot of these,
um, saprophytes, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're producing, um, humic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they can do things like, um,
compete in the soil with bad things,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: With pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sometimes they can parasitize some
things like, um, so I'm not going to name
[SPEAKER_02]: any, but, uh, sometimes they'll be,
uh, SARs, you know, kind of induce
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they, they might produce antimicrobial
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that a lot of, you know,
a lot of these products have been,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, um, made into biologicals that we buy
as, as fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but really we're not, they're,
they're not feeding them is not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit anything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let nature take its course.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were buying living soil and mother
nature has balanced that living soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't shift a population to something that
might not be as beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're buying a living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would not put living soil in a
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it more outside, but that's my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have to go down that road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you are going to buy living
soil, please let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feed it anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's no need to, um, kind of like
your gut microbiome, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't shift it to something that's
not natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, when we say living
soil, what we're describing is typically a
[SPEAKER_00]: peat-based media with a compost fraction
and a lot more fertilizer in the mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully balanced by the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or people are making their own,
you know, sort of a third compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: third pea, the third pumice or perlite,
and then they're adding a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just to, so we're clear on the
definition there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still technically soil-less because
it doesn't actually contain soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, does contain a typically more
organic matter, more biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think the, now one thing I'm
curious about is cause people will,
[SPEAKER_00]: with what you just said, people will say,
okay, well, you just, you just shared that
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these fungi are typically
innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce humic acid, which is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can maybe trigger SAR, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they may be decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a higher organic matter soil that,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are the chances these things are,
are probably beneficial then can we,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause you're saying we shouldn't look at
them as indicators of anything really in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of soil health, but a lot of these
things can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could just kind of touch on that
a little more, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're, if you've got a,
we'll call it soil living soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a kind of a soil is medium with
compost in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just leave, let's, let's generalize
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, they, so there, there's a X number
of different, uh, microbes that kind of go
[SPEAKER_02]: into the mix from the very start.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those populations are going to shift
based on what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if there's a good food source for,
uh, let's say, um, an antagonistic one,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say it has a food source,
its numbers are going to ramp up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it competing with something
that's not going to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to, they're going to fill
their own needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's not a food source for them,
they're going to go away because something
[SPEAKER_02]: else is going to take its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be based on what's
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, another way to put that is
that, um, the ones that, so the ones that,
[SPEAKER_02]: so once you put a root system in there,
right, once you got that rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you want that population to be able
to shift to benefit that rhizome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that population to be able to
shift like any that are mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't want to out compete your
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you've got a root there,
you, and you have mycorrhizae there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want them to be able to do their thing
and not be out competing by something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just really breaking down a little
bit of, um, a little bit of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so more microbes are not necessarily
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: More isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I would rather see that,
let it balance on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because what's there is what's going
to shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that population is going to shift based
on what's in that root zone or what's in
[SPEAKER_02]: that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying what you're saying is that
these, that this soil is alive and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these like functional niches
that already exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to, uh, we don't want to
sway it one direction or another too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to let essentially let nature
take its course and those microbes are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are able to manage that themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant can really control a lot of
that through the rhizosphere interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better than I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I see a lot is when I
add, so we'll let's say at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, we have a bed and this is indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've done a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add our, uh, nutrients back in,
and this may be a combination of fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, lime, gypsum, uh, whatever the soft
rock phosphate, whatever these fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: are to, to re-add the fertility that was
removed during that crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do that, we will tell that into
the first six to eight inches of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, what I typically see over
the next few days is I will see some
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelial growth on the surface of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will typically just turn that back into
the soil so it doesn't really take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what, what are your thoughts when
you see that and what sort of management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, if any, would you incorporate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't manage it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've added in more organic matter,
more compost, whatever you're doing to put
[SPEAKER_02]: that nitrogen back, um, usually some kind
of, um, carbon source, then you've got the
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposing composers that are there and
they're just decomposing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're on the surface,
that's not even the same ones that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be functioning at their root system,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Deeper down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, speaking of all of that, I am a big
proponent of mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an outdoor grower, you should be
mulching just like you, you mulch your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should mulch mulch your vegetable
garden and you should mulch your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a big mulch person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so again, you're feeding organic
matter and then nature does what it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you're going to have different
profiles at different depths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time, every inch you go down,
you're going to see different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ones on the surface are generally
not going to be the same ones that are at
[SPEAKER_02]: that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's from a pathologist perspective,
what are your favorite mulch options?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything is better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, any, any, I know so organic that's
lowercase O any natural mulch,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's wood mulch, pine straw,
I'm really originally from Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bagasse, which is the fiber from sugar
cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I use leaves at my house now because
my neighbors rake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just pick up the bag leaves on
the side of the road in the fall and I
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch, I mulch with anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so any way to cover that soil,
to keep from losing the integrity of
[SPEAKER_02]: degrading the integrity of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're protecting the soil and it's
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I don't till it in, I just layer
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just layer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Layer, layer every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what mother nature does,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk into an old forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother nature has done the very same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It balances out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with mother nature though,
mother nature doesn't really believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases or pests, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just organisms trying to
complete a life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may see those occur in our,
in our gardens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're, if we're managing them from a
natural perspective, uh, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we know that monoculture,
okay, let's talk about monocultured ag,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that when we put lots of the same
plant together and any pathogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, finds a niche, it just goes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's nothing, there's nothing
to balance it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we start talking about living soil
or, you know, using whatever for mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so kind of an organic mulch or we,
um, do a lot of intercropping or
[SPEAKER_02]: introcropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're, we're introcropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're introducing a lot of different
microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then again, that's where mother nature
starts balancing, but you can very well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting in a plant that we have bred
for bud size, for height, for whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, as we breed, we can lose traits,
resiliency, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, um, accidentally breed in more
susceptibility to a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what keeps me in business,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more diversity we have in our,
in our micro microbiome, the, the more
[SPEAKER_02]: chance we have of that balance,
but you will again, back to our powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildews, powdery mildew will come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, in nature, it doesn't really
matter, but what we have now, we have
[SPEAKER_02]: these, these plants, these cultivars,
we've cultivated these varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, exactly for size, flavor, um,
terpenes, height, and we've lost some
[SPEAKER_02]: resiliency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to get the magic of,
um, what mother nature provides,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have to realize that diseases
will come in, but the more diversity we
[SPEAKER_02]: have, the better chance we have of having
that, um, natural kind of pest management
[SPEAKER_02]: or to be able to say that's not enough
powdery mildew to be worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, powdery mildew we usually do manage
powdery mildew, but other things like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Cercospora leaf spot or Septoria leaf spot
is a really big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, we've realized that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done enough research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have an economic impact.
Correct.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not really even a plant health impact,
like it might look really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Septoria is a really good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Septoria leaf spot is for a pathologist,
a beautiful disease for a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts as a small spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a really broad, um, yellow halo
and very quickly the leaves turn yellow
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaves drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen 90% leaf loss and then the
plant produces more leaves and we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: completely normal harvest, um,
with no yield loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be really deceiving and growers
tend to not believe me because they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my leaves are on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so those are the kinds of things that
we have to balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we keep doing research and
in trying to, to understand what matters
[SPEAKER_02]: and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when is a, um, um, a more natural,
um, scenario with just a few plants like
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you've got a couple of plants in a
vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have a lot less disease than
maybe someone with a lot of plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing else because of that diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, if you have an
epidemic, it's going to be much more
[SPEAKER_02]: severe in a monocultured scenario,
but, um, we always try to put a square peg
[SPEAKER_02]: in a round hole and that's what we do as
humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we're always trying to balance
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you risking any disease by bringing in
like in this case, you mentioned fallen
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that would be a vector for
potentially other pathogens as well as,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, whatever that homeowner might have
sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with compost, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything we bring in, we can risk
introducing, um, people who get wood chips
[SPEAKER_02]: from the city, you know, that composting
the wood chips, you know, they often bring
[SPEAKER_02]: in poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, yeah, you can, you can risk
bringing a lot of things in, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to decide what that risk is
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also be bringing in diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have balanced my risk by saying I've
got these leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this organic matter and by
improving my soil, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the risks do not outweigh the
rewards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not making a living on it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't pay my bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so I'm taking that risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a balance and you can vary,
you know, let's say, let's say some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, rephrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you risking bringing in that can
equally infect your cannabis or your
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato plants in your garden or your
squashes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one, what, what are you risking
bringing in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And leaves of an oak, uh, from my
neighbor's yard, it's highly unlikely that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing anything in that's
detrimental, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if it's local, but if,
um, if it comes from you not know where or
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to find the perfect mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's just, it's just like straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find I end up with a bunch of grass
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always, and then that becomes a
pain to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, plus most straws sprayed in that I can
find locally anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, leaves, I like to use bag leaves in
the fall and over winter with leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I typically don't use them during
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one from an aesthetic perspective,
I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it is just the aesthetics
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife likes a very clean looking garden
and I have to account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also, uh, I just, I find that
sometimes the, the, the water management,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little less control over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, however, it from, from, if you're not,
if your water is not dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mulching offers a ton of benefits
in terms of the ability for the soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you mentioned all of the benefits
from a microbial perspective, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding carbon to the soil, your increase
in organic matter, though typically our
[SPEAKER_00]: soils are already sufficiently high in
organic matter relative to agricultural or
[SPEAKER_00]: actual soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I think it's a, it's a,
you know, you have to, you have to weigh
[SPEAKER_00]: it out as a, as a benefit, cost benefit
sort of situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as there's no perfect mulch,
there's no perfect soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no perfect media.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there, you know, you're not
going to find perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to decide where you fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there was a perfect mulch,
it would be pine straw in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love pine straw, especially fresh pine
straw that you can rake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody listening that has access to
pines, it's the best, um, second to like
[SPEAKER_02]: Cypress bark, not Cypress wood,
but Cypress bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's shredded and it's like tangles in
together and it's really nice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, free mulch is my absolute
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I put enough, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a sufficient layer of mulch is much
better than an insufficient layer,
[SPEAKER_02]: a thin layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's, uh, my ornamentals
background coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to look into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're not things that are easily
accessible to me here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big difference in location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a greenhouse grower in Montana that
really wants to run a mulch, but has yet
[SPEAKER_00]: to find anything that he can run in his
greenhouse that either, um, doesn't bring
[SPEAKER_00]: in pathogen risk or, uh, weed seeds,
um, but would give him all the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture management and, and soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still looking.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would consider a steamer if I was a
greenhouse grower, um, because you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, make sure you're not bringing anything
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course you don't bring in the
microbes either, the beneficials,
[SPEAKER_02]: you lose everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, greenhouses are a different story,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in a greenhouse, you don't have
that ecological balance that you do
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors and you can try, but you're never
going to get the equivalent of an outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in terms of, of, of a natural balance
of, um, beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when a greenhouse grower or a
basement grower, a closet grower should
[SPEAKER_02]: never try to mimic, they're different,
they're very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're greenhouse growing on a
commercial level, uh, be very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very careful about some of the things that
we've been chatting about, like bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: in leaves and bringing things in from the
outside and never, ever bring in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's my, that is my pathology take
on the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so be very careful, understand what
you're doing, try things at a small scale
[SPEAKER_02]: before you dive in, um, put test plants
out, whatever you need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, always test things before going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping in with both feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, uh, we do see that you mentioned
isopods, roly polies, and we see,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that, uh, as a, as a big issue for
people with really high organic matter in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in controlled environments because they
actually will girdle the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have other people that are
intentionally introducing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it's a, it's a wild
world out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, we talked about the main stuff
that I really wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I did have one question,
you know, since we last talked,
[SPEAKER_00]: what sorts of things are you seeing,
uh, in the pathology world in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and cannabis, um, right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, you know, not a lot different that,
you know, we, we've seen a lot of new
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, um, and over time, I think I
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That when a cultivar is highly susceptible
to disease, it's kind of going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, people aren't using it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for sale anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're shifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finally shifting, um, that we're not
breeding for disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're kind of selecting, um,
you know, now we've got some cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: that are kind of listed as powdery mildew
resistant, for example, uh, to keep with
[SPEAKER_02]: our theme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, resistance, a big word, we use it,
but it doesn't mean completely resistant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's some tolerance in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're starting to identify those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, leaf diseases are always number one,
because that's what people see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are a lot of other pathogens,
beware of root, of root pathogens or soil
[SPEAKER_02]: born pathogens, as we call them,
be really weary of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we've kind of talked about that
this, this, you know, what last 30
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, um, be careful what you bring in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the industry shifts so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one thing we're seeing in the hemp
world, and we've, we've identified it in
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers too, is Fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing it in grains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing it, um, even in flowers of,
uh, floral cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so just kind of be careful of that if
you're near wheat or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a big, um, project going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what was the Fusarium, you said
Fusarium head blight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium head blight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, uh, it will affect the grain and
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very different than Fusarium wilt,
which is a vascular wilt or Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: solani, which is a crown rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different Fusarium species out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but this one affects grain,
um, and flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very common in wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know anything about it,
you could just Google Fusarium head
[SPEAKER_02]: blight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you'll, something will come up with
wheat and you'll know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's out there and we're seeing it
a lot near, um, corn and especially wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: or when wheat is used as a cover crop and
letting it go to seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use any kind of Gram and
Nicholas cover crop, terminate it before
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what does it present as in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you look for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is just kind of a die back in that
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, um, kind of that, that stem
and that into that raised seam,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that peduncle, I think that's the word
you call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it'll kind of be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see some, um, mycelia, back to our
term, you'll see mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycelia in there in between the flowers
and, um, it'll be kind of, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuzzy and like, but try this then it'll
kind of have that, but try this look,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, but try this is gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mycelia, um, uh, from Fusarium
headlight is more white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but try this is gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they call it gray mole because
of all the sporulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's going to look different,
definitely to a pathologist, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you should not see it in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen, we've identified some of it
in, um, greenhouses in a germplasm study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we have not really seen it in
greenhouses, you know, as a, as a primary
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it is seaborne.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of heads up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a big project going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly pertaining to feed grain,
um, hemp grain as animal feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's where that's coming from,
but we do see it in floral hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crops, just don't let your,
your wheat, um, and fry, um, cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: go to seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, make sure you mow it or crimp it
before you start seeing flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other diseases, um, probably nothing
super new, um, for plant health is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring up a lot of secondary diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we get excited about them in the
pathology world, but healthy plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have kind of the same few
diseases over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and I say this every time,
um, that outdoor plants will have
[SPEAKER_02]: different diseases than indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I make my separation,
not, um, high THC versus low THC or a
[SPEAKER_02]: floral versus grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really that indoor versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where that difference really lies
in the pathology world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any insects that you see as
bigger vectors for pathogens than others
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of cannabis pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of your pests will transmit
viruses, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So white fly transmitted viruses,
thrips transmitted viruses, aphid
[SPEAKER_02]: transmitted viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, those are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there, that's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no new discoveries there,
but, uh, definitely pest management,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, any kind of, um, insect screen to put
around greenhouses and greenhouse vents
[SPEAKER_02]: and those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we see a lot more viruses out West,
um, from the Rockies on West, a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really don't see many viruses in the,
um, central and Eastern region of the U S
[SPEAKER_02]: but those are generally insect
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some that are met mechanically
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means us, that means hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we see, um, and I'm going to
generalize and say that anytime you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: physical damage to any plant, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be, um, chewing an insect
chewing, or it could be mechanical damage
[SPEAKER_02]: or environmental damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a hail storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you have a wound, then there are
lots of pathogens that get in that way.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but tritus loves to get in through a
wound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, any kind of management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so insects can contribute that way,
not directly, but indirectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, I mean, we, I know we
intentionally wound our plants by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning to increase airflow and open up a
plant, you know, allow the plant to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: its energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on the flower versus the overall,
uh, you know, leaf biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we control that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what you're saying is we are also
opening ourselves up to more pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking all the hard questions
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this plant also seems to respond
really well to herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a stress response that allows for,
it seems like increased growth from what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing with cannabis compared to
other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time we prune, we do open that
plant up to infection, but what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, but tritus is your inoculum load for,
but tritus in your greenhouse so high that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not willing to take that risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's that inoculum load.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how many spores are floating around
in the air, or if it's, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something else, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your pruners or wherever we're going to
transmit, but yeah, that's another
[SPEAKER_02]: balance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the art of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why not everybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time you prune, you're making a
wound and the, you know, anything can get
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that, that the plant being
healthy and having a very low disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, there from the start, it's really
going to take you a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start seeing,
um, a separation of good growers and poor
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're sloppy and then it's time to
make really hard, heavy pruning cuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's usually where your vigor will take
a dive or plants are going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, you know, overcome this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything we do is a risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've opened the door and created another
layer of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly enough, uh, I just got
back from, uh, Melbourne, Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got to visit one of the larger,
uh, farms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a greenhouse operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things they shared with me that
I think you'll find interesting is they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have powdery mildew pressure out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not an issue where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they deal with botrytis, which
obviously is, is difficult, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they've never had problems with
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was asking them that you're
walking through with the humidity in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the space, you know, it's winter right
now over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they have conditions that I would
think, um, would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more optimal for for powdery mildew,
but there was none that they just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not something they've had to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I'll tell you, uh, gray mold or a
botrytis, uh, a little bit of tidbit about
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it likes very high humidity,
85% and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's almost where you can feel
it in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so 85% humidity and up is usually
where we're going to see, uh, botrytis
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew between 40 and 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of your powdery mildew pathogens,
70% is your magic number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your magic cutoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have your, uh, humidity below 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're usually good for most of your
pathogens, but botrytis 85% and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, botrytis also likes it to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you've got condensation,
so if you've got those warm days,
[SPEAKER_02]: cool nights, and you're kind of dripping
greenhouse, you know, that's again,
[SPEAKER_02]: contributing to that, uh, free water that,
uh, botrytis likes so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes it to be cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, but botrytis is a weakling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the sissiest of all of our
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to get in somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to let it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but, you know, we talked about
pruning cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there are a lot of, um,
there are a lot of natural openings and
[SPEAKER_02]: wounds that it can get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see botrytis, we call it gray
mold, because again, those are all spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's gray or that brownish gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of, there's a lot of
inoculum when you see gray mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also will get in and colonize dead,
dying, diseased tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got yellowing leaves,
if you've got spent blooms, if you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of debris, any, uh, drop leaves
that fall on the floor of your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where botrytis is really going to
colonize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that when you do have a wound,
it can get in, or you do have a really
[SPEAKER_02]: humid, um, microclimate between,
um, between, uh, inflorescence right in
[SPEAKER_02]: that, in that head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you'll see it in there,
but, um, it really will primarily colonize
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that's damaged, dead,
wounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so keeping things clean, um,
once you see botrytis, once you see gray
[SPEAKER_02]: mold, um, you have almost exclusively
cultural practices that have to be taken
[SPEAKER_02]: care of before you can even think
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to manage your humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to circulate that air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to space your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to clean up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, you know, think about it in
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that life cycle of the
botrytis, um, scenario pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will help, help you make
sense and how you can use cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: practices to really reduce that risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will let your fungicides work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your inoculum load is so heavy that you
still got, you know, um, decaying,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, plant tissue there, no fungicide is
going to manage, um, gray mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you have to be able to reduce that
humidity and clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, so boom, so many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see botrytis, let's say I spot it
in one bud on my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm already laden in flower that
eliminates the ability to spray any oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfurs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, you were, you're suggesting that
the first thing we need to do is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can't control that little
microclimate inside the flower itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily inside the bud as most people
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we can't control the humidity in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be a good target humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to try and drop it as much as
we can?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even outside of, you know,
typical VPD ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the pathologist, I'm telling you to get
it below 85%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85 is really high though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, most people are not going to
be that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen botrytis in rooms when
we're at 60% humidity though.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the fluctuation?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the nighttime?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's that, so watching it, watching it
over time, because usually it'll raise at
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll raise when you water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouses, wet floors, wet surfaces,
wet soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's wet in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, when you walk in, it may be low,
but think about the fluctuations because
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't need a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you maybe water less,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure that when you do water that,
you know, we always say to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: water in the morning, so things dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe switching some of your watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those floors don't stay wet all night
or, um, being able to vent your
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, even when you normally would
keep it closed to keep it warm,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe do more air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially if you've got those cool
nights and you've got that condensation in
[SPEAKER_02]: that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, look at your, look at your
nighttime humidity and you may be
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming though, our night, let's,
okay, so let's just take humidity out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture though, and say that it's,
we're keeping it below 85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think, cause I'm thinking a lot of
controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these guys are keeping it below
85.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still seeing, but try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just more susceptible
and we need to be aware of that because
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow these massive, large colas that,
um, frankly, that microclimate inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, inside that cola is just,
it's impossible to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you're also suggesting we need to
remove all detritus, all dead matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly don't want to be dropping any
leaves onto the soil or the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause so, so what, what, if I'm
understanding correctly, we may not see,
[SPEAKER_00]: but try this on those leaves, but their
potential habitat and a food source for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but try this to increase for pressure in
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dense colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about, think about a cultivar with
that really dense, um, head versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that kind of look spindly that nobody
ever really takes seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have more air circulation there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spread plants out more hair
circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add fans, um, those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all too often we see commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are too close together and that's
all air circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you know, you can look at the
humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity in the room might be 70%,
but bring that, bring that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity meter between plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's where you have that high
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can you do to lower humidity
between plants inside a canopy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, yes, it's hard to manage inside a
canopy and some of these cultivars,
[SPEAKER_02]: but think about ways that you can increase
air circulation, which is doing just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lowering that humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exchanging air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get kind of inside,
like that late season, when you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: that really dense flower head,
it's really hard at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that point you've had that inoculum
load all along.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can manage it until then,
then your inoculum load may be lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you avoid all pruning in a room once
botrytis has been spotted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned an area that has air
circulation that you need to increase one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ways you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is mechanically through pruning to
remove leaf matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are you saying though that it's where,
where's the cost risk benefit on something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can't directly answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would look at other things, other ways
that I can manage how far along in the
[SPEAKER_02]: season, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are we at early flowering or very late
flowering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can, um, can pruning actually help at that
point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is inoculum load so high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we rescue this crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would probably prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would also look broadly at,
you know, to see what else I can do and
[SPEAKER_02]: some other things I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pruning alone is not going to be magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so thinking about it and, and again,
every situation, um, the weather outside
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to dictate even a controlled
environment greenhouse, the weather
[SPEAKER_02]: outside, you know, if it's cloudy outside
versus sunny outside, all of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to play in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's all humidity and,
um, debris driven at that microclimate
[SPEAKER_02]: level, if not at the broader level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be in that microclimate
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look at the humidity inside of a
canopy and I guarantee you it is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be really, really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can you, can you back off on the water
a little bit on your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How, how, how can you clean, um,
or plants far enough apart to clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have enough space, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your greenhouse such prime real estate
you're not willing to space?
[SPEAKER_02]: A million questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, under canopy airflow as a way of
increasing airflow through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've, I've found, I mean, I haven't
had to deal with botrytis at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it hasn't been an issue, but I think
that that's something that, that cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practice that could help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when I see botrytis in a bud,
um, I want to remove that from the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually want to, with gloves,
and clean pruners, I assume cut that out
[SPEAKER_00]: and take it and remove it from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to remove a far, a large
amount of spores, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than trying to spray it or treat it
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not going to salvage that
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so think about how you're going to
prune that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say we have a greenhouse with,
I don't know, let's pretend, let's say we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a thousand plants and only this
corner that maybe it's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: shade from a tree outside is, is affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to remove those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to remove the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to remove just the,
the obviously infected flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are you going to prune those and
gently take it outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to cover that flower before
you cut it so that you're not shaking
[SPEAKER_02]: spores everywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are you going to toss it into a
wheelbarrow or a wagon or a cart and
[SPEAKER_02]: disseminate those spores?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as you're tossing, um, lots of
questions as opposed to if it's the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's the entire house, then you've had
a problem for a longer time than you
[SPEAKER_02]: realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Yeah, it'll spread pretty fast though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're talking hours instead of days
or weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with botrytis, it seems like,
it seems like it moves pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a lot of times it's usually
somewhere lurking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's usually like inside of a dense
area, um, dense flower head or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, um, it's on the floor in, in debris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's pretty, it's probably somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you have a history of botrytis,
um, for whatever reason, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your climate, your, maybe your greenhouse,
you can't really, um, control the climate
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as you thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, using, um, using fungicides until
flower begins, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can control that inoculum load
before flowering, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there at high enough numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of just, you're just
lowering that inoculum load for when
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting to balance, all of those,
um, those IPM practices, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, IPM is integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using all of the tools in your
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but thinking about where it came from,
how long it's been here, maybe you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize it fast enough and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a learning process, but how do you
find it earlier?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would it appear first?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you scout for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you've had it two years in a row,
you absolutely need to be, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the first thing you need to be
doing is spraying something at least early
[SPEAKER_02]: in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, finding out why, where that,
where that high humidity is or where you
[SPEAKER_02]: may have not been able to clean up as
well, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are airborne spores,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So not as much as the sanitizing the
pruners and sanitizing the greenhouse at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the season, um, a lot more
about, um, environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that it could be an issue
earlier, like before we're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's the only time I really
associate botrytis is when I see gray mold
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the buds themselves, the inside the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I've never really looked at botrytis or
I've never looked at like a veg plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have any flowers and said,
oh, that's clearly botrytis whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, the lead, the detritus on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: There or on the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: If how do I scout for beyond just pulling
apart buds and seeing gray mold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, it can cause damping off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can affect seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cause a tip light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so look at it from a tip light
standpoint, um, and look at it in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in just a yellow leaf hanging on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, look at those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you say that, so I want to take
like a jeweler's loop or a microscope and
[SPEAKER_00]: look closer at that yellow leaf and see if
there is any mycelia growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to find, you should be
able to see it with the naked eye
[SPEAKER_00]: visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep your eye out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause sometimes we see like if we've got
a, you know, dead dying leaves and we see
[SPEAKER_02]: they kind of get like moldy, we kind of
just disregard it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That leaves dead anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, you know, it's just a
sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could very well be botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's just kind of, it's,
it's going through this life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's primarily a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very weak pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we call those opportunistic,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You put out the all you can eat buffet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you've got, if, if you've got
it there and it's in your greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's lurking and it's multiplying,
um, and then you go to flower and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got that really great dense bud where it
can hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more of it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said when I add fertilizer,
there's, um, and I see some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelia growing from that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if it's at all gray, do I need to turn
that back into the soil then to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, but try this, or is there no
chance that that would be a botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: species because of the fact that it's a
fertilizer and not plant material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, but try this is not going to
be colonizing soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be, it's, it's, it'll be above
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be on, you know, debris setting
on the ground, on the surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, it's really going to be higher in
the canopy or at least on the surface on,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I want to avoid adding leaf mulch if
I have a botrytis problem or I've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis problem in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your garden, like outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking outdoors, you'd mentioned
using leaf mulches is one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love leaf mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I love leaf compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite, you know, leaf mulch
compost is my absolute favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have a history of botrytis,
would I want to avoid using leaf litter as
[SPEAKER_00]: my mulch near my cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, outdoors, unless you have a,
unless you have an environmental condition
[SPEAKER_02]: that I, that's really, really humid,
you should not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should not be a red flag there for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually that's when you're in that
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's when we really see botrytis as
a real problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and we will find botrytis outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, I'll use it like for teaching a
class, you know, I'll go out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll find it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that doesn't mean it's like taking
out plants like it would inside of a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of season here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not ideal for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always see botrytis in powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the plants just crash because of
the colder temperature, the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, you know, all the things we
talked about.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: And botrytis likes it, botrytis likes that
cool weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, anybody that has major
problems, maybe try an auto flower or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that'll flower faster that you
can get your harvest out before it starts
[SPEAKER_02]: turning cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think of some ways that you could,
um, protect a little bit, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, you may have to jump through
some hoops if that, if, if outdoor grow is
[SPEAKER_02]: really going to be conducive for the
tritus, but the tritus is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't, you can't exclude the
tritus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will appear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give it the, um, the microclimate
to, um, to infect and to colonize,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can you share a couple of resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know, for example, I follow your
Instagram channel, the Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the URL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it in on the, on the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some great posts on there that
are really shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should be following that as a
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other resources that you
want to share really quickly before we
[SPEAKER_00]: sign off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will, I will give you links to our
social media and, um, I will have some
[SPEAKER_02]: research reports for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm hoping that we're, um,
turning our peer reviewed manuscripts,
[SPEAKER_02]: our research manuscripts into something a
little more, um, grower friendly and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, pretty soon, um, hopefully in the next
six months or so, we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: curated image database through,
um, a multi-state collaboration,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, where you will be able to look at
pictures that have been validated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, I should be having that pretty
soon and, um, hopefully in, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: the next year we'll have some really
exciting research, but right now I will
[SPEAKER_02]: just, um, everything will push through
pretty much our social media, but I'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: those links out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
