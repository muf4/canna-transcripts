[SPEAKER_00]: So I get asked from time to time,
what lights am I using in my grow and what
[SPEAKER_00]: light companies do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked with a few different light
companies over the years, and the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using in my grow right now is BIOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a smaller company, NASA spinoff,
so the lights are well engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that NASA connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think as a nerd, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the highlights about these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do they have very,
very good PAR levels, efficacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that, they have this glass cover on
the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really, really important
because if I just clean my lights today,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and the amount of dust and
overspray and stuff that can end up on
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights can really affect the overall
PAR or PPFD levels that you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: down here, and you may not even realize
it, and you don't want to be cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that to me is number one when I'm
looking at an LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, customer service and warranties
are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the light is so well built,
they have a seven-year warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of anyone else in the
industry even coming close to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I work really closely with my rep,
Jennifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's wonderful, and so she helps me with
lighting proposals, technical questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just shoot her a text.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love having that one-to-one close
relationship, and I haven't had any issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with the light, but I know if I do,
they're going to take good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light here, to tell you the
difference, this is the TI2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this light's been out, I mean,
don't quote me on this, but for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only complaint with this light is it's
a little overbuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really heavy to lift up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it a little bit unwieldy,
but that's because it's built like a tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could drop this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would still work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moving over here, they just came out
with this light last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate enough to get one of their
prototypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the BIOS Endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a six-light bar instead of the TI2,
which is an eight-light bar over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the PAR levels are really,
really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're 650 watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, for some reason, you needed an
800-watt light, then you'd have to move
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the TI2, because this one's only
650.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it weighs 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to move up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It folds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So installation took me all of two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much plug and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the form factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants, as you can see, are doing just
as well under it as they are under the
[SPEAKER_00]: TI2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention that we work
with BIOS directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted a lighting proposal or an
estimate on one of these lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wanted to try out the Endeavor or
the TI2 in your garden, or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in the Luna or some of their
top-bar greenhouse lights, just hit us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to get you over the spec sheets,
any information you may want on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even help with a lighting proposal or
design for your space specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking it out.
