[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw in top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is gone by the online name
of Clackamas Coot on such forums as ICMAG
[SPEAKER_00]: and Lumper Dogs on Grass City.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an organic grower and gardener who
has helped many people in improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they garden and move away from bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is most famous for his neem,
crab, and kelp soil mix, which many people
[SPEAKER_00]: know as the Coot mix, which he shares
freely, and the sprouted seed enzyme teas
[SPEAKER_00]: he makes using barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Coot eight or nine years ago when he
came to one of my talks in Portland on
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became friends and I have to attribute
a lot of credit to him in regards to our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mixes and nutrient packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been a good friend and mentor and
helped me to improve my gardens over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we start, I wanted to find
out, did you want to go by Jim or
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, more people know me as Coot,
unfortunately, so that was my fault,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not hiding anymore your identity?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I never was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I got tired of Instagram and the
silliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I thought forums were bad,
but they don't hold a candle to social
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a whole, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, I never made myself a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I ever did was pass out information
about how people could make the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mean, I'm not selling anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I'm disgusted with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I take it that obviously,
given your type of business, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the teas and biology and what have you,
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever run a test on the mammoth,
what a name, mammoth microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what got me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we're done, check out our blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my latest blog post was I took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it in the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added different ingredients as food
sources because one of the claims that one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their sales guys, probably the guy you
saw, I don't remember the guy's name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he said that the microbes are in a
dormant state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not or they're past their
reproductive states, which wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I was even familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Tim Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that was a possibility,
but he doubted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I talked to Colin Bell,
the founder, real smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked Colin a lot, actually,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really good conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from talking to him, I asked him
straight up, I'm like, can I put this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea or are they aerobic
microorganisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I add a food source, what will happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, you can probably
reproduce them in a brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just tested it out, posted all the
microscope video of it and let people draw
[SPEAKER_00]: their own conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you been out to any dispensaries
since cannabis was legalized in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want good weed, you got to grow it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't find a good tomato candy in this
country because it's been decimated by
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These production numbers and they have the
way they have to pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pick them green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run ethylene gas inside the trailers
and transit so that when they arrive at
[SPEAKER_01]: the produce warehouse, they spend less
time in the ripening rooms which are
[SPEAKER_01]: injected with ethylene gas, just like
bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also do avocados.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring the color on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get color, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them out to the store because the
consumer, all they want to see is color.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want a good tomato,
you got to grow your own, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we grow our own every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, I always plant at least three
new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I have one Japanese trifle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a potato leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been baking bread now for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did six months at the Baking Institute
of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was six months long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then three weeks in France,
working as slave labor, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: in bakeries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what an opportunity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my daughter, anyway, real life
stuff happened and I wasn't able because
[SPEAKER_01]: my plans were to open a bakery over on the
coast, but it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still have the skills, so I do all
my own baking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I promise you, unless you go to an
artisan bakery and are willing to pay $7,
[SPEAKER_01]: $8 for a loaf of bread, you're not going
to get that quality that you can make in
[SPEAKER_01]: your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about worm castings?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd like to talk about because
that's what I really got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start off talking about worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Doug gave me a yard and I split it
with a yard of black leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine what this is going to be
like when it's finished?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 gallons of premium worm castings,
which would probably last me two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like the smallest guy grower you've
ever met, believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, worm castings is my hot button
because I've been studying Edward's
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermiculture book and other writings by
Rhonda Sherman and Yasmin Cardoza relative
[SPEAKER_01]: to not only the disease suppression
benefits, but it was Yasmin Cardoza four
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, the insect suppression
properties of quality vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a worm cut because I got some
really exciting news relative to neem and
[SPEAKER_01]: barley in the bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'd love to cover a little of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing I've been arguing
with people about recently is I got I got
[SPEAKER_00]: ripped up online for posting about how
composted forest products, forest humus,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those things is just code for
sawdust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they're lower quality
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys jumped on me saying, no way,
peat's unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These forest products are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with leaf
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then so they're like, why not use
this isn't leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they're like, use leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use use forest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, those are not
commercially available, sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat's the best the best we have,
you know, and I'm not saying it's perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they, you know, use hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, come on, guys, this isn't
commercially available, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might want to ask you, think about
that a little bit, too, just to kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the arguments before we start,
the arguments are based on the political
[SPEAKER_01]: and economic issues in the British Isles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to this day, in the countryside,
the majority of homes are heated and their
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking heat is peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Brits want it for gardening and
the the Irish are saying no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like you want to take our oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if you want us not to use peat,
then you need to bring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure and bring in natural gas or
something into our homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want us to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a Scotch drinker?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you've heard the term smoky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, that comes from peat moss,
because when they cook the malt or the
[SPEAKER_01]: wart, whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you can tell there's some really
peaty ones out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is so Scotland and Ireland
basically tell the Brits to go screw
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they bring these arguments that are
legitimate in the British Isles because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's politics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hubris and it's economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to bring that to the Canadian deal
that's tightly controlled by the CCSPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of propaganda out
there from the cocoa from the cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, it's it's not even the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, of course it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, they they screw themselves here in
Oregon and California in the nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: industry 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where did they turn?
[SPEAKER_01]: They turned to the weed growers,
but it was a disaster because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it comes from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying, well, yeah, these are dandelion
petals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long that take you, you know,
to to assimilate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's it is tightly monitored
with, you know, they have adults in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: running things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if their orders sun grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest more than all their competitors
combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers from last year from CCSPM,
that's a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, CSPMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian Spagnum Peat Moss Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sun grow harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready for this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifty four percent of all the peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was allowed to be harvested,
but if sun grow got big orders,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't just go, well, hey,
we're going to we're going to pull another
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 truckloads.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount that you're allowed to harvest
is set.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like last year when Alaska Peat ran out
before the buyout from Aurora Innovations,
[SPEAKER_01]: because on the on the bales at three point
eight bales like you and I use or have
[SPEAKER_01]: used, whatever, those are cut and wrapped
at site.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the stuff that is bagged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we'll talk about it because that
stuff is dried in a kiln.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it sterilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they killed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you bring it down to big plants like
the one in Woodburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ground to a consistent size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's hit with steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to get it wet again,
because when the customer opens the bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to say, oh, God, look how
fresh this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, so it's been sterilized in an
oven in a kiln.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the stuff used for
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about smaller than a three
point eight bail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that goes in the bag stuff like
sunshine mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gone smaller than a three point
eight cubic foot bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you buy a bag of any of those
others, most they say peat moss on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like saying flowers and what
the kids call mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big one is, oh, peat moss is
acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you talk about sphagnum peat
moss?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, it's not acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't use peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little it's not as acidic as I
think people claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nice thing about that acidity is
it allows us to add calcium to get us back
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the levels that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we need to talk about castings because
castings are literally coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to go ahead and get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd really want to talk about worm
castings initially here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we dig right into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been at the request of my
supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little investigation on adding
neem meal to the what people incorrectly
[SPEAKER_01]: call bedding and the numbers on both the
reproduction rates as well as the length
[SPEAKER_01]: and girth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The increases in length and girth from the
neem was quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Doug at Northwest Redworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows or he produces his vermicompost
and worms in long windrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he does as a general rule is to
pile up the aged manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he dumps in produce that he picks
up from produce companies and what have
[SPEAKER_01]: you, a number two stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he set up another one and all he
added was malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't at my request, I just told
him that this is what it did in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wanted to see what effect it would
have in as far as creating vermicompost
[SPEAKER_01]: and worms to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that he had never seen the
reproduction rates of worms like he saw in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pile with just the malted grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense because what those
grains are doing through the enzyme is
[SPEAKER_01]: deconstructing, excuse me, it's a catalyst
to deconstruct the material, making it
[SPEAKER_01]: more available to the microbes to break it
down for the worms to ingest their manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how castings are created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is he gave me a yard of black
leaf mold, three year old leaf mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I split it with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set up 100 gallon smart pots on a
pallet for aeration through the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we added copious amounts of
barley, neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other day, I just barely lifted up
the little top layer of the bin and the
[SPEAKER_01]: worms were just masked like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did start out with, I bought six
pounds and 100 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought six pounds of euros because they
tend to stay lower in the material and do
[SPEAKER_01]: a better job of finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Doug loaded the stuff in the
truck for me, he said, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be quite a bit of red
wigglers and cocoons in this material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have red wigglers work
in the top and the euros work in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the European worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Europeans do not make a good
choice for vertical flow through because
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to stay lower in bedding or
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it food stock because I don't use
kitchen stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use either compost or good quality
manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My chiropractor has draft horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine how much manure they
produce every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has them in a field and he does
give them vermicides, which you have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just age it for four to six weeks and the
vermicides that were given to the animals
[SPEAKER_01]: deconstruct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're no longer a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the reason I went with six pounds is
I asked Doug, I want to have this finished
[SPEAKER_01]: by before the rain season starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he mentally calculated, I said,
I think that this will take care of it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the amount of red wigglers that you
have and cocoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause what I saw the other day when I
lifted up the material, obviously we're
[SPEAKER_01]: wigglers cause the euros, I went ahead and
just loaded them in the lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of did like a lasagna.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did manure and kelp meal, barley,
neem or Karanja, and then do another layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or excuse me, the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so it's kind of like sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were definitely the red wigglers
and they were massing like you would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to see if you threw in like say
chopped up, uh, fresh peaches or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something has a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I'm pretty excited about what
I'm going to have when this is finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause I figured that'll be enough for
me for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the time and small amount of,
uh, startup money, I want to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty nice castings when it's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the thing about cold compost,
and I learned this from your father,
[SPEAKER_01]: one time we were talking about cold
composting is that many, if not most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the secondary metabolites in the plant
material remain intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not lost like they are in thermal,
uh, thermophilic composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exciting to have those
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the neem and the Karanja with regard
to, uh, insects and disease, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: suppression.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's a, and also then you can
add other materials like, uh, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how you've been down there up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you probably, you've had,
we all had a lot of rain this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I already did my first cutting on
comfrey, which is usually I don't get a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting until the middle of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones I cut, uh, they're already
backed over 15 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame you can't cross comfrey with
every food plant in the world because you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't world hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're, we're in the same page up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we've already done our first cutting
and we're well on our way towards our
[SPEAKER_00]: second cutting already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, you know, talk about free,
uh, fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like using that word, but for,
excuse me, newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can't do any better than kelp and,
uh, comfrey and alfalfa, those three in
[SPEAKER_01]: some either by themselves, or in some
combination does nothing but good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, for our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do want to caution listeners in
regards to comfrey because, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's important that you use a sterile
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the bocking 14 is the one
that is most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the one we have on our
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in addition to that, wherever you
plant that comfrey, you're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime commitment to having a plant
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It owns that piece of real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our staff, uh, made some poor choices that
I wasn't aware of at the time with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple plantings of comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have it inside our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas before we were just using it as a
great weed barrier, uh, a border for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, poorer quality soils as a way of
keeping, uh, seeds out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we got a few into the middle of
the garden that had been planted there or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, poorly weeded, we're having a
heck of a time getting it removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and horse tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not horse tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, horse radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted some horse radish and oh my
gosh, I can't get rid of that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I explain the bocking nomenclature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and explain a little bit more about
comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk about that really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back at, uh, at the end of the 18th
century in 1790 were the first seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: were sold in great Britain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not that the plant hadn't been around
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ancient ones out of the Greek
era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 500 before the common era thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were, so they were selling seeds
because it was an incredible livestock,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, feed, but it's extremely invasive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the thing about fertilizer didn't
really happen until closer to like the 18
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the 1930s, uh, a nursery man in
Essex, England, whose, uh, nursery was on
[SPEAKER_01]: bocking road, the name of Lawrence Hills,
whose book, uh, comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Past, present and future was a,
is a summation of his research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the research stations was here
in Canby, Oregon, just a few miles south
[SPEAKER_01]: of Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those documents are still in the
library.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't check them out, but you can go
into their reading rooms and review them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally they were close to 20
different balking one through balking 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to check the book because I don't
want to get bad information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly why the balking
14 is the one that survived or became the
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically everybody that grows balking
14 is growing root cuts from a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: was established about 1945.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and for those who, uh, pay homage to
the genetic drift, that might be something
[SPEAKER_01]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any event, so that, that cutting
has been passed around now for over 72
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, the sterols are great,
but like you said, that postage stamp
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of real estate, you plan it,
they own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price in Portland area right now
starts at $300 to remove a comfrey plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause remember they put down roots twice
as deep as a fruit tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people that do silly things like take
a rototailer to it, find the next year
[SPEAKER_01]: they have, you know, hundreds of sterile
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't take much to start a
new plant, just a little bit of root
[SPEAKER_01]: material as you probably, cause I know
you, uh, prepare them for your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it doesn't take much to,
in a little container of the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have, uh, you know,
another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter inch, half inch of a root can
potentially start another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and by this, not the first year,
but by your, let's say you planted it in
[SPEAKER_01]: now, a new one, they got to say the,
one of your customers came into your,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, nursery and bought one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get much this year,
but even by next year, you're already
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start getting some really nice,
uh, amounts of, uh, of comfrey biomass to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I used to make the tea
where you soak it till it smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just so silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cut it down, top dress it as a
green mulch and you know yourself how fast
[SPEAKER_01]: it disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so much nitrogen,
plus it's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty soon it just disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see powdery mildew on it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to go straight into my
compost pile rather than into my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reason that we use comfrey,
I think is really important to let people
[SPEAKER_00]: know in terms of it being a dynamic
accumulator, how it pulls nutrients up
[SPEAKER_00]: from the subsoil and minerals that are not
normally accessible to your other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not putting roots quite so deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, produces a ton of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaf matter that we get out of it is
really, that that's essentially free
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the same thing that alfalfa,
especially here in the Northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's grown primarily, uh,
east of the Cascades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those soils are some of the richest
volcanic soils in the world, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And alfalfa, because you don't plant it
every year, you go broke your priced
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time you're into your fourth or
fifth year, you're, uh, deeper than 30
[SPEAKER_01]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it too, which is twice as deep as the,
almost twice as deep as the comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, the final bio nutrient
accumulator that I'd like to mention is
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a plant that grows, uh,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 200, 250 feet a year without a
root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's remarkable is that it
accumulates 83 elements, but it leaves the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that would impact its growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also our garden, if we use it,
and that would be salt, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulate salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, kelp meal alfalfa and
comfrey are the, some of the top bio
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient accumulators, because in the case
of the land plants, how deep their roots
[SPEAKER_01]: go and the kelp that we get comes out of
the North Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave, the human race has been pulling
that kelp out of the ocean since 1372 to
[SPEAKER_01]: use as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, uh, in the early, early days,
they used to burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, why you have to do that
with wood to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, it's not necessary with the kelp
and the advantage here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kelp is all those elements,
all 83 are in the right balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the Grostar stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, this one's magnesium hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want a high dose of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the best way to screw up
your soil because just like when you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: child and you got sick, your mom might've
given you milk and magnesium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it tightens up your floor and your
gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the same thing in the soil and
restricts the airflow and water flow and
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I know you don't want to get into
this, but the whole imbalance of turning
[SPEAKER_01]: the cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: On its head with excessive magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the kelp and all these,
the other two, everything's in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they really add to,
if I were going to make compost piles,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do compost my material first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the mesophilic stage,
that's when I would add those
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't put it in at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why burn them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it drops down below a hundred and
you're starting your, hopefully your
[SPEAKER_01]: several months cure of your compost and
you can add those materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just like your dad and I talked
about cold composting, those compounds are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to remain intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we just had, uh, the worm
castings from Doug tested and he does,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do mine the same way he does,
but I was telling you the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it came in at 6.8 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get any better than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's without any amendments or
that's just the raw casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of something that a lot of
people don't quite understand about
[SPEAKER_01]: castings is that inside the worm's gut,
not the gut, but a digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have a stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The material, the castings are covered
with a calcium carbonate slime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you can't have problems
if you're using quality castings in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do some other silly stuff,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think is a little unique
is you invest a lot of time, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money in creating high quality castings as
part of your own personal soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make up your recipe, can you
explain a little bit more about why this
[SPEAKER_00]: is so important as an, as an fraction of
your total media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's obviously too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I take that hit all the time
and I just shrug my shoulders and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mix is the one that we all talk about
years ago when we all met at ICB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, a third of, uh, sphagnum
peat moss, and I don't want to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: this discussion, but, uh, I happen to
prefer pumice or lava rock, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: scoria because I can buy it at the
landscape yards for nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a real, I don't like perlite
because when I owned a nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: we grew plants that have to be in the
field for several years, Japanese lace
[SPEAKER_01]: maples and perlite moves around,
floats to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumice doesn't float.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays where it's supposed to be in the
strata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so, and then a third,
uh, castings, is that too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for some people, if you don't have
your own thing going, maybe it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as poor quality, as you know,
we do a lot of gardening here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there's a lot of different
choices for compost, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it's turned out, isn't always such a
good thing because let's be honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That aren't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's definitely a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we use the only compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I told you about it almost a
decade ago and it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they do use a little bit of
post-consumer waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So occasionally we find some plastic in
there, which I'm not terribly excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but the thing that they do,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus all these other companies is what
you talked about with that static
[SPEAKER_00]: composting pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That material sits for two to three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something that you don't
see in any of these other commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: composting facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's a huge, huge difference that
I can't emphasize enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The value of compost, in my opinion,
is the key component is how long was it
[SPEAKER_01]: cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we proved that with our castings
because the material we're starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the castings that I'm creating right now
at the black leaf mold, which was really
[SPEAKER_01]: a, that's a big gift because you know
yourself, that's a multi-year process to
[SPEAKER_01]: create black leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what we made a lot of our
compost out of for years, our fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm already starting off with material
that's three years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't have the lab equipment that
would be necessary to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, the chances of me
buying lab equipment to grow plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere between nil and none.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it didn't work, then you know,
I gotta, I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had, I've never had bad worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I've had to start with one year,
like health reasons, I couldn't make my
[SPEAKER_01]: own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't laugh, but I went and bought bag
compost at Portland nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew going in that it wasn't going
to be good, but you know, the old
[SPEAKER_01]: expression about value added commodities,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time it ran through the worm
vermiculture cycle, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I made sure I added things like I'm a
big kelp user.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it, my raised beds, because in fact,
you were the one that told me about the
[SPEAKER_01]: book several years ago, Dr. Sands seaweed
and plant growth or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seaweed and plants or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seaweed and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one who put MaxiCrop on the map
back in the fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: William Stafford was the founder of
MaxiCrop and they began using a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never intended as a retail product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was strictly an agricultural product,
something that could be mixed in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: and applied to large fields and orchards
and what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were using sodium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I don't know, probably in the
seventies, maybe, maybe it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties, you started seeing MaxiCrop show
up at retail nurseries in a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they bring it into their factory
south of Chicago on the Illinois River.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so they mix it with water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bottle it, because you're not going to
ship bottles of fertilizer from Norway to
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland, Oregon and have it make any
sense as far as price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to bring it in as a powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: My objection to the powders is that
everything is destroyed in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones, secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big one is alginic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alginic acid can hold 250 to 300 percent
of its weight in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for outdoor raised bed venues and that
kind of thing, having kelp in there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good way to maintain the, well,
the wetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of the term right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture retention content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps that move along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a cure-all, but it's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what good compost does,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It retains water and slows down the,
and then we use our most, we slow down the
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most water that we apply to our
gardens is lost through evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, imagine, look at the numbers
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of staggering.
[SPEAKER_01]: The percentage of five gallons of water on
a raised bed, how much goes up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I want to address is when
people talk about your soil recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably the most popular,
freely available soil recipe for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners that want to do living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I address that, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give you the opportunity,
a little platform, to talk about that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've said this many, many,
written this, posted it many, many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1937 or 38, Cornell University,
which, as you know, is one of the leading,
[SPEAKER_01]: even then, leading horticulture research
schools in the world, not just the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, but the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of things were established that
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example, or that week, whatever it
was, a number one nursery pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, isn't a gallon, never was a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number two isn't necessarily exactly
twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the nursery business,
when you go to the suppliers and you pick
[SPEAKER_01]: out the sheet, or the product,
they'll hand you a sheet, and it'll tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you how many units you're going to get per
yard of that size of container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a shovel full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were trying to begin a process of
standardizing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: To show you how old this was, this is
before perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of puts things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting perspective for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All people have to do is look up the
Cornell mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And modified it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only used three, well, I guess you'd
say five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used copious amounts of basalt rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're blessed here in the Northwest
because we have some of the best basalt in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with hardness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, as you know, I'm the one introduced
using malted grains in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what most people would
call amendments, it's limited to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp, neem, and crab meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've kind of backed off crab meal
because that's a lot of money to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: chitin when I can get all the chitin I
need and do from the malted grains,
[SPEAKER_01]: barley in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people say, well, you know,
I did that coos mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, you know, the potassium was just off
the chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't do mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went and got something locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been steer manure from Walmart
for all I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what you used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't make my mix because you don't
have my castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say that you made a recipe,
but I changed things and now I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making any money off this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't care what they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone has to spend an inordinate
amount of time whining about something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is just silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use bad biology in your soil,
you're going to have a bad soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use unfinished compost,
I don't need to explain the science to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what it does to the roots,
burns them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So garbage in, garbage out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want good potting soil, you got to
start with some good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you got to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this year you got to get by doing
this, but you can start a worm bin today.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is go buy a smart pot,
load it up with some aged manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put in some aeration material because,
you know, this is an aerobic process,
[SPEAKER_01]: vermiculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then buy all the worms you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cocoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can get the cocoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that's a more affordable way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Online, there's a gentleman down in
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like the guru of cocoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he sells them to the commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, figure each cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.8 worms per cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once a cocoon hatches, or the
hatchlings leave the cocoon, within 42
[SPEAKER_01]: days, they're sexually mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then will produce three cocoons a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that every worm is going to
produce at least, on average, 10 new
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others have different reproduction rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the numbers put in Dr. Edwards'
Vermiculture Technology book, that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had perfect conditions, and we never will,
but let's say that we could set this up,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pound of worms today would be 1,000
pounds a year from today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the name of the company that
you turned me on to was Blue Ridge
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermiculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that ring a bell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was in North Carolina and also
had a something set up in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, Blue Ridge, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think the important thing,
essentially what you're saying is that in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for people to truly evaluate the
quality of your recipe, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have to use your worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've already talked a little bit of
how much time and energy you put into
[SPEAKER_00]: creating those worm casting, and what
important aspect of your total soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I don't have to have a new program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to be with a dog collar and a
choke chain tied to, I don't name names
[SPEAKER_01]: because they might be an advertiser or
something, but it's just, the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is silly to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to a couple of these weed thing
events, and these companies have these
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful displays and they put people in
there who they could either be selling
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance door to door on Saturday
morning, or used car salesman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look, ammonium nitrate is ammonium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, go take a chemistry 101 at the
community college down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are buying stuff because of the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the big one that gets me is,
well, it's proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're an idiot for buying that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're believing that there's some
mythology that there's something special
[SPEAKER_01]: that has to go into this new product so
you can grow whatever it is you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, can you imagine the tomato
industry doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first guy that shows up, sales rep at
California tomato commission and all said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we're all going to switch over to
this because look at this cool label.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hot button.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason we see these
nutrient programs in general being so
[SPEAKER_00]: successful is because either A,
people are starting with a poor quality
[SPEAKER_00]: media, or what I see a lot of is people
are trying to grow like they would
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically with organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have giant plant, tiny pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a five foot plant in a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there has to be, that's one of the
reasons that I think you were there at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point when one day a, I wouldn't call
it a study, but it was a field test
[SPEAKER_01]: conducted in Aurora, Oregon at the
research station for, I think it's OSU is
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that runs that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, at that time, as a group,
they're called auto pruning pots and smart
[SPEAKER_01]: pot is a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I don't know that now
there's geo punters, but they did a test
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ones that were commercially for
commercial growers, air pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that one Caledonia tree company,
dumbest idea for cannabis ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a difference between growing
saplings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I speak from experience then growing a
annual, just a whole different dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice how small the diameter is on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're tall cylinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're narrow cylinders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest losses in the nursery
industry is what's called knockovers and
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes from wind and storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing you want is something
that's top heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's challenging enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the smart pot, which their
parent company before there was smart
[SPEAKER_01]: product was called a tree bag company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it morphed into high caliber,
but those are still manufactured for the
[SPEAKER_01]: sapling growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're interested, you can go to
those separate websites, not smart pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a part, it's part of the same
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but as a group, the auto pruning pots
do allow you to get more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they say you had a five gallon
standard, what they call them the black
[SPEAKER_01]: lipped nursery pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we all, that's the ones you get
when you go to Home Depot and buy a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be on one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you use the number five,
which in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get more biomass, but you're not
going to get double, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to set up your garden
that makes sense to you and then live
[SPEAKER_01]: within those restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause trying to push something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Johnny at grass city or IC mag or
whatever it says, Oh yeah, just a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you've got these silly
concoctions that make zero sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, if I had a poor soil, my focus
would be what it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp, alfalfa and neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's that bad, then do better next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, make better choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to change directions a little bit
and talk a little bit more about barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of something that you've
really brought to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of, uh, enzymes from barley and
enzyme teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you started out initially
sprouting the barley after attending a
[SPEAKER_00]: beer making class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit more about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: About, uh, where you're at now with it and
your thoughts and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I attended the San Francisco baking
Institute in preparation to open a,
[SPEAKER_01]: or accurately and not so accurate called
artists and bakeries and in what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: lean does, which means just the four
elements, yeast, salt, flour, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: for baguettes and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also add what is called malt or
diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would buy that from a bakery
supply house and never really understood
[SPEAKER_01]: or really cared much for what diastatic
meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one day out of sheer boredom,
I decided to look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, well, this is just
barley malt and diastatic means that the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes weren't killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is with like barley extract is not
diastatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's non-diastatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it doesn't have any value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sugars are there and some
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Tim Wilson and I were talking back
and forth online and I asked him about
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's used to a commercial yeast for
bread baking and which is a single celled
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we add diastatic malt to our bread to
enhance the activity of the yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking, well, what if we put
sprouted garlic at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: I still didn't understand that you could
just go buy this stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at a brew store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd go over to Bob's red mill and get
organic barley raw, you know, and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all malting means is just you let
it sprout or germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you don't really you don't grow it
taproot at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day a friend who fancies
himself to be a beer master said,
[SPEAKER_01]: once you just go buy malted barley at the
brew store, you know, they make this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went and bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started adding it and then other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that I saw decided besides
the increase in resin set is that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting off several percentage points off
the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the advantages that I have that
probably a lot of people don't is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing the same not strain the
same plant through cuts, mother cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: mother cut for thirty three years so that
when I test something, I can immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: know what is standard and if what change
there is good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially your control,
your genetic control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many people I see, well,
yeah, I'm going to try fill in the blank,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time I'm going to use this seed
or cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has nothing to do with research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately I saw that I was finishing
15 percent faster and then other people
[SPEAKER_01]: who use different methods of determining
when it's finished started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never even I never even discussed it
because I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there was just too many people
posting that, yeah, I'm I'm seeing 15,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 percent reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing that I saw is the
increase in the girth and what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: call the potential strength of the
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having to to use far less support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the later stages of flowering from the
flowers being so heavy, but but the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: set is off the off the chart and some of
the fellows, especially at Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I couldn't believe how much they were
adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm really cautious, as you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these guys were adding like,
you know, five pounds a week, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on 200 gallon pots, the outdoors,
the boys this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I said, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of seems insane
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I've been adding it to my
worm bin, I can't believe the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: biology activity with not just the worms,
but the other organisms that we find in a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy worm bin, you know, the shredders
and the this and that, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of what happens when you try to
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've approached a lot of brewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, brewers are only care about
one enzyme, amylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in barley, we have urase, protease,
phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a total of eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted so many times I can almost type
it automatically even reading it because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know from bread baking, if you use too
much malt or diastatic malt, as they call
[SPEAKER_01]: it, that all of a sudden you lose your
structure and your structure is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's gluten.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's gluten?
Protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I learned that it's the protease,
too high levels of protease weakens the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of the gluten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore you're not getting what
bakers call the inside of the outside is
[SPEAKER_01]: called the crumb.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inside is called the I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside is called the crust and the
inside they refer to it as the crumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bakers will talk about, well, how's the
crumb on that flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use too much diastatic malt,
the protease is accelerating the breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: of the gluten, the protein, which provides
the structure to the bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in our soils, that wouldn't be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can attest to is that not one
person in my circle and I don't read too
[SPEAKER_01]: much online because people will mix it
with, you know, ammonia because somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: told them to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that malt didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It burned my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't the ammonia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it was the barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing incredible acceleration,
like after you transplant your rooted cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: and just sprinkle maybe like a half a
teaspoon of barley on top and just water
[SPEAKER_01]: it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That alone will accelerate the root growth
to get them ready for transplanting
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, depending on your system of
rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim, can you expand a little bit more
about why these what enzymes do,
[SPEAKER_00]: why they're important, what started what
the barley is doing or you think is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's making it so beneficial to soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: In part of the amylase, of course,
what's amylase do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your saliva is uber levels of
amylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts breaking down sugars,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbohydrates into simple sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what plants use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And protease, proteins, ures, urea,
and then phosphatase, which since that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: popular discussion, especially in cannabis
boards, you know, phosphorus, real or
[SPEAKER_01]: imagined, that one should really get them
excited because these things, if you the
[SPEAKER_01]: description used by biologists is that
enzymes are catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so chitinase, for example,
chitinase is important because chitin in
[SPEAKER_01]: and of itself doesn't really do much in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chitin is a polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an acetyl form of a glucose amine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what your if you had surgery,
either external or oral surgery,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll sew you up with chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another interesting connection
to the Albert Hoffman, the man who
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated several compounds in ALD 52 and
LSE 25 and later went when he was at
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandoz Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at the age of 22, if you can imagine
this, he graduates with a doctorate in
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry or biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one who figured out the
molecular, not formula, but structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a big deal in 1922.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, I mean, this genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he really understood the complexities
of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what, for example, it's grown
on rye ergo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in our soils, they accelerate the
chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the bacteria try to deconstruct this
polysaccharide, it creates chitinase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's chitinase that gives us the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what deconstructs the egg shells of
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example, there's also topics that
listeners might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chitinase salicylic acid pathway,
which is one of several pathways that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants have as a defense system,
the SAR, the systemic acquired resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ethylene, salicylic acid is a key
component in several of the pathways,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why I've also been a big advocate
of using quality aloe vera materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we add the barley to, and I really
strongly, if people are going to do a worm
[SPEAKER_01]: bin, please add all the barley you can,
because it will really accelerate the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion of manure into vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another reason that he used
fulvic acid, because Dr. Foss,
[SPEAKER_01]: he has an interesting description of
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enzymes are catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he wrote that fulvic acid,
pure fulvic acid is a catalyst of catalyst
[SPEAKER_01]: and a reason to do according to the
directions because his products are
[SPEAKER_01]: professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't start high dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see Jurassic Park plants
start high dosing, with fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's something you're not going to
be able to flush out either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use barley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've just, we started using it in
our nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do edible veggie starts, and then we're
just now planting our rose out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have, well, the stuff that I've
been working with you on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures, I've been using that in trials
in different rows comparing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to share that with you here
really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't done just the straight
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just set up my vegetable garden,
because I'm not actually growing any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have my vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my gardening is vegetables too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've started using my raised bed there,
and I just planted my tomatoes last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to start trying out some of
these things here at home too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd like to tell your audience
is that when you go to a home brew store,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter what grain you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they have rye on sale, malted rye,
buy malted rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have oats, which is one of my
favorite for no other reason, it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, it sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep thinking of the guy on the Quaker
Oats box, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, buy price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they'll have distressed
merchandise, maybe water damage to the
[SPEAKER_01]: sack or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go ahead and get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, okay, Steinbart in Portland,
they're the oldest brew store in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started 98 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't believe the number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started doing that, I said,
well, yeah, Steinbart has everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go in there, and they probably have 10
different malted grains, like different
[SPEAKER_01]: red wheat, white wheat, barley,
spelt, oats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were telling me, you wouldn't
believe how many people order from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, they don't have brew stores in
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, use some imagination, you know,
I mean, something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I'd like to add, I'm not saying
that you don't want to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly in compost, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do not use spent brewery grain the
same way that you're going to use malted
[SPEAKER_01]: barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one has been trans changed through the
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either go buy the real stuff or do
something else, is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that spent grains aren't
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you like to, let's talk a little bit
more about how you process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go in there, I know at FH
Steinbart's, they have a grinder there
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you like that coarser ground malted
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that really comes down to
personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I'm going to mix soil,
yeah, I mean, larger pieces are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started, I used a grain mill
that I bought from Austria, a Como,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you got it to the finest powder that
it could so that I could sprinkle it on
[SPEAKER_01]: top the soil and then water it in with a
Chapin concrete sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really get it pushed down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were going to top dress,
I'd probably want to use you want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the finest grain you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're preparing soil or certainly
for your compost material, then you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: you could get larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a free service and most larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I understand, I've traveled
around the country looking at them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I understand that most stores have
grinders for their customers to grind the
[SPEAKER_01]: grains they buy for the home brewing
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they usually charge a nominal fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not able to adjust the grind
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get kind of get what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's not the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of a finer grind,
like you mentioned, is greater surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area so that the microbes are going to be
able to break it down faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was proven at a project that I
was involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told them to get to grind it or
worst case scenario, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would do a few pounds for him in my
Como grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they decided, well, no,
we're not going to grind it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they mixed it with the the whole
malted grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the worm castings and top dress some
plants in a public garden that were under
[SPEAKER_01]: distress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what was interesting is that in spite
of fact, they were when I went out to
[SPEAKER_01]: visit like two weeks later, the grains
were still intact for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of evidence of fungal
growth mycelium just exploded in the areas
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding the piece of grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's kind of exciting news because
that confirms what I thought is that this
[SPEAKER_01]: was really a very high, excuse me,
a very good food for fungal development in
[SPEAKER_01]: our compost worm bins and in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll send you the photo that was taken
at 20 X.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, looks like some bad cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you forgot about in the back of
the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a red color and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems in trying to get
information about malt is that I talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: over 20 brew masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a couple, they had people or
founders of artists and malting houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know that not one had any idea that
there was something called chitinase and
[SPEAKER_01]: malt barley, malted grains or phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or urase or protease?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was blown away, but they can
talk about amylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got that one down because that's the
one that is central to the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can I address one other thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two types of barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, there's two row and six
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six row is pretty much only grown in
America and it has higher levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: amylase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does not translate into that it has
higher levels of these other enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones I care about, the chitinase,
phosphatase, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's a much smaller crop,
a harvested crop, you're going to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: through the nose for six row.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you don't have to use barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use whatever they have at the home brew
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is one little caveat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rye has slightly higher levels of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should become really popular here
with a certain sector of gardeners that
[SPEAKER_01]: obsess about phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if phosphorus is your big thing,
then go for the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part one of our interview with
Jim Bennett, also known online as
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our next installment, we discuss neem
and further depth and also the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: the one, the cultivar that Jim has been
growing now for over 40 years.
