[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Tim Wilser,
the microbe organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some listeners may know him better as
Microbe Man from his helpful posts on many
[SPEAKER_00]: internet forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim is a longtime friend and colleague who
has taught me much of what I know
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding microscopy and evaluating
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider Tim to be one of the foremost
experts and researchers on aerated compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas and microbial amendments in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim also founded www.logicalgardener.org,
a free forum for gardeners that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honored today to have him on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tim on here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I would like to
talk to Tim about would be to hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more about your background
regarding growing cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pretty unique history there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear a little more about that
style of growing and how you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could start with that, that'd be
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess starting back around 1995 or so is
when I kind of more seriously got into
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with outdoors and then slowly
moved it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years after that, I ended up
having an association with the BC
[SPEAKER_01]: Compassion Club Society, which provides
strictly medicinal grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, it was around 1,500 to 2,000
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning, we just started out
doing basically what everybody else was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with the pots, like a five gallon
pot under the high pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the end of when we harvested,
we would just dump the dirt out and use it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the vegetable garden or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it just started occurring to me that
this was kind of stupid to be wasting all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We graduated from there to just starting
to remix the media as we went along each
[SPEAKER_01]: time, adding some more compost to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention too that we had also
started out just using typical chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: mix fertilizers, checking the EC PPMs and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of had started at the same time,
graduated out of that when we just started
[SPEAKER_01]: using compost and some more natural
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we had been expanding
our outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the outdoor gardens, we didn't mix
anything up every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just left it as if it was a vegetable
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants outside were doing just as
well, if not better than the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I thought, why don't we just try to
move outdoors indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty rapidly graduated to using bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that would have been around 1999
or 2000, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem being with the bins is that
they take up so much space and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: move them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we just got the idea of building bins
which could be stacked on top of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other with the lip sort of facing out so
there was a little space to get into to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant the young plants, the rooted
cuttings into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hung three high-pressure sodium lamps
in the center and had the four boxes
[SPEAKER_01]: stacked high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess around seven stacks or something
around the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just stopped doing any digging up of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I thought, there's no way this
is going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we experimented with one set.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just top dressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In between harvest, we would inoculate
with fermentations like EM fermentations
[SPEAKER_01]: and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only prepared thing we were using then
was fish hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, we just made our own
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that system, we would allow the
plants just to grow up over about 10 days
[SPEAKER_01]: to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would just change the light to the
12-hour cycle and then start flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole turnaround time was close to 60
days, 64 days, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants were only 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were tall, approximately,
when we harvested them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it like that, we got the same yield
as we were getting before where we were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing these larger plants and over a
longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up getting actually a higher
yield that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I don't know if I described it
exactly perfectly or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ask any questions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what size were these bins
that you're describing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what was your media in the bins that
you kept reusing?
[SPEAKER_01]: The bins were about 30, 36 inches long and
14 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom, they were about probably 10
inches wide and then where they sloped out
[SPEAKER_01]: to about 14 inches at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making the initial mix we found over time
with experience after we started the other
[SPEAKER_01]: bins is fairly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to have a combination of things
that stay in place for drainage for a
[SPEAKER_01]: longer period of time over the life of the
soil, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used things like fine gravel and pea
gravel and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that component, intuitively,
I just thought let's use as many different
[SPEAKER_01]: colors as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that makes sense scientifically,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in keeping with the human diet that
supposedly if you eat a variety of color
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you get a variety of minerals and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my idea with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course, we mixed in sphagnum peat
moss and topsoil from outside and
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost that we raised ourselves just
in a big heap in the barn full of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk about that too, Tim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a unique vermicomposting style
and I've seen the microbial results of
[SPEAKER_00]: your vermicompost and it's always fairly
superior to pretty much everything else I
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to share that with listeners too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think I finished off the mix there
satisfactorily?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my way of doing it is quite
different and really I count on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to life and having a life that's
ongoing so the microbial population stays
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and doesn't get disturbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really what contributes to
the success of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should add too that as far as pests go,
like insects that chow down on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and root suckers and stuff like that,
we were really fortunate in that when we
[SPEAKER_01]: brought in some of the topsoil and the
vermicompost from basically outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also brought in some rove beetles and
they were just indigenous to the area and
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically kept the pests in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just amazing that we had success
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition to that, we also bought
some curcuminous and some persimilis and
[SPEAKER_01]: both of them, we also had another room
where we had an 18-hour late going all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and both of them multiplied on their
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't give them anything special to eat
or anything like that, but especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: curcuminous just propagated like crazy so
whenever we needed them in another room,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would just dig some up and take them in
and move them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention that the longest time
that we had those bins going without
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing up the soil was seven years and the
other ones were about five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just got interrupted because our
contract was questioned by the authorities
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had to sort of shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the vermicompost, we had two
different methods that we used for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, like I said, was just done in a big
heap in a small barn that we had built for
[SPEAKER_01]: that purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we piled up horse manure that we got
from our field and we usually pick out the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's semi-dried out and mixed in
some sawdust and straw sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was almost all horse manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And into that, we would mix some wheat
bran that was very cheap to buy at the
[SPEAKER_01]: livestock supply store, some alfalfa meal
at no greater than 5% because I found out
[SPEAKER_01]: the hard way that if you put too much
alfalfa meal in, the nitrates just kill
[SPEAKER_01]: the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also put in some peat moss into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't say kelp meal yet,
did I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put in as much kelp meal as we could
afford to at the time, which wasn't very
[SPEAKER_01]: much because it's more expensive as an
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the important part with that is that
we left it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically our worms were neglected.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't harvest it out on a continuous
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my opinion is that because the worms
were sort of forced to keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: re-digesting what was there and to digest
every little scrap they could find instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of having new food, new food, new food,
new food given to them, they produced a
[SPEAKER_01]: superior quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our vermicompost was not typical
looking like the castings that you see in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sort of real gooey, gummy stuff
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other method is that we used
basically the same ingredients except
[SPEAKER_01]: added kitchen scraps as well and raised
them in big plastic bins, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: subjected them to staying in there for a
very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our method of harvesting the worms out was
to use those plastic mesh transplant
[SPEAKER_01]: trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would just fill them up with the worms
favorite food and cover that over with wet
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper and then lay them all over the
top of the worm pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would crawl up in there and then we
would just snatch them off and then
[SPEAKER_01]: gradually throw them all into a big bin
and then come in with the tractor and
[SPEAKER_01]: clean the barn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we also scooped out some of the
worms and the castings of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that you've talked
about already was just the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial communities in the soil as
being the most critical factor for
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing you to have the system where you
could go five to seven years without
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give listeners a little
background into the microbial loop or
[SPEAKER_00]: living soils as you call them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so first off you know with a living
soil there's you know microbes live
[SPEAKER_01]: hierarchically so that there are some
microbes that have evolved to function
[SPEAKER_01]: close to the surface of the soil and some
halfway down and some way down at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom you know where there could be rocks
or whatever and so the ones that are at
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface are the the ones that
decompose things the fastest and
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically it's called the detritus
sphere where detris shit and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: branches and leaves and everything fall on
there and so they have at their disposal
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of fuel you know they can use
the the oxygen which is abundant nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: is abundant you know light even that some
microbes uses is there too if they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's why that's the fastest area that
things are degraded and then and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: the altered component of what was degraded
is then passed down to the next set of net
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes etc etc etc so that's sort of a
sort of a basis of of why you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: leave your soil intact and then you know
if you're outside or if you've put some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of rocks or minerals at the bottom of
your soil mix then possibly you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineral microbes that will therefore
pass some minerals up the scale instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: down the scale the as far as the the
actual nutrient loop goes the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: players in that are are the the bacteria
and Archaea I should take a minute to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that Archaea I lump in with bacteria
because they're absolutely indiscernible
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking at them with a
microscope and for many many years we've
[SPEAKER_01]: we've thought that that it was all
bacteria that we're looking at it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: been in you know the past 20 years and you
know getting more and more that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: discovering that Archaea are everywhere
and that maybe they they are just as or
[SPEAKER_01]: even more responsible for the
mineralization of nutrients but anyway so
[SPEAKER_01]: I put those together bacteria and Archaea
they process organic matter or minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they are consumed by protozoa and
in the protozoa group the the two
[SPEAKER_01]: important ones in in our soil that we're
looking for flagellates and naked amoeba
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they they use only 10 to 40 percent
of the energy that they intake from eating
[SPEAKER_01]: those other organisms and the other 90 or
to 60 percent is expelled in an ionic form
[SPEAKER_01]: that's directly available to the roots of
the plants that's really an economic thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant because then it doesn't have
to expend as much energy to to gain
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients you know that would take us into
another topic to talk about root
[SPEAKER_01]: exudations but I don't know if we want to
get there quite yet but I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_01]: explain that as simply as possible but to
put it in a nutshell the the protozoa eat
[SPEAKER_01]: eat the bacteria and poop out ions that
the that the roots can uptake that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already you know in a form that that is
available to them yeah no that's great I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the way I usually explain it is when
we're putting out miracle grow or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of you know chemical or ionic nutrient
we're directly feeding the plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in direct contact with the roots
plant grows when we put our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer like alfalfa meal or kelp meal
we're not directly feeding the plant but
[SPEAKER_00]: all this microbial interaction is what
causes these nutrients to be changed into
[SPEAKER_01]: a form that the plant can then uptake yeah
true but that's that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and and you know if we're if we do
get into this a little bit the the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria archaea and fungi that that
initially degrade the the nutrients have
[SPEAKER_01]: organic acids that they excrete for that
purpose and the the plant roots have the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same organic acids that they utilize
or very very similar anyway for to to
[SPEAKER_01]: release nutrients as well that's how how
plants could do it without the the
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms there to cycle the nutrients you
have some of the nutrients which are
[SPEAKER_01]: stored in adhered to these organic matter
or clay particles are you know stored as
[SPEAKER_01]: as we everyone knows as cations and they
have certain net positive charges a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: guys talk about how you have a certain
balance of soil and along comes another
[SPEAKER_01]: charge and lo and behold the the the
nutrients is is released from the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter or the clay and is that then
available to to the root but it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a hundred percent that simple or
maybe it is simple but it it it also
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs from it's it's caused by the
organic acids I talked about so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have say you have like calcium it's got
it's got a plus two positive charge so
[SPEAKER_01]: we've learned that that it is released by
by hydrogen so if we look at you know one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the organic acids say citric acid which
is very common it has eight hydrogen bonds
[SPEAKER_01]: on it so if you consider that those if you
divide the two into the eight we get four
[SPEAKER_01]: so that means that the citric acid could
release basically four units for want of a
[SPEAKER_01]: better word of the calcium nutrient and so
these organic acids are actually released
[SPEAKER_01]: by the roots and by the microorganisms it
isn't something that just happens because
[SPEAKER_01]: of having a certain mix in your soil at
least in my opinion so do you follow what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean or is that too crazy so these these
organic acids that are produced both by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant roots as in the form of an
exudate or by these micro microbes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil you're saying is what is what's
essentially making these various plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients available to the plant in an
ionic form it yeah it is actually what
[SPEAKER_01]: releases from the where it's stuck you
know the cadion exchange capacity right
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's stuck to the organic matter or
the clay particle so that it's the trade
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hydrogen atoms that make up that
molecular structure that actually releases
[SPEAKER_01]: equal amount of nutrient from the positive
charge cadion sure so so so it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still it's the roots of the plant and the
microorganisms that are making that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I would say it's important in
your soil mix to have a microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbially active media meaning adding in
vermicompost or having a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: compost fraction in there as well as a
good peat moss is a good way to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: that nutrient cycling yeah absolutely and
like with peat moss it's got a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: CEC so it it has a large capacity to hold
nutrients which are then available on an
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing basis yeah so the plant can
control what nutrients become available by
[SPEAKER_00]: the exudates that's feeding to the
microbial populations in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the organic acids it's using to
break down some of these nutrients itself
[SPEAKER_01]: is that correct yeah basically it's kind
of um it's complex beyond complete
[SPEAKER_01]: simplification but in in my mind I sort of
simplified it in in the that the even
[SPEAKER_01]: though the the roots can excrete these
organic acids to get the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves they can also excrete amino
acids and sugars that attract certain
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria to them and so then by attracting
and feeding those bacteria the the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria increase vastly in population
very quickly and so that stimulates the
[SPEAKER_01]: protozoa to come out of their cysts to
exist and then they begin dividing so as
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria release the basic nutrients
that we talked about with with the
[SPEAKER_01]: excretion of their organic acids and then
the the protozoa begin feeding on them
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically multiply the amount of of
nutrient that would have been available to
[SPEAKER_01]: begin with so so that for the economy of
the plant it makes great sense that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: released this energy in the form of the
amino acids and sugars to start feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: these bacteria to begin with it's it's
almost like when you watch a compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: developing right when you you start it up
and then you feed it some molasses or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever food stock and and the bacteria
are there are just about the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to begin multiplying and then because of
that the existence of all those bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: it stimulates the protozoa to come out of
their cysts and to begin to divide as well
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's kind of the same thing is going on
but it's in in the soil so let's talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this before anyone takes this
concept and starts dumping sugar all over
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants can you explain a little bit
more about maybe a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses and different sugars and then
also what happens when you put too much
[SPEAKER_00]: and what happens when these bacteria
reproduces too rapidly if the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: produce too rapidly you mean in in the
soil or do you mean in a compost tea I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to save compost tea for just a second
I'm talking about just in the soil I I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of leading you to a question but I
think you're gonna get there so what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens if we add let's just say too much
molasses into into a soil what's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: what's gonna occur I'm not really sure you
know I can't say and I don't I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what too much is but too much of anything
is not good and so I would I would just
[SPEAKER_01]: guess that if you put too much molasses in
there you'll get an overabundance of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and they may end up eating
everything in sight it depends on what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have in the soil to begin with you know
because molasses is a food for fungi as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as bacteria so it does make some
sense to to just apply some diluted
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses occasionally to to soil they use
molasses I don't know if you know about
[SPEAKER_01]: this but if there's like an oil spill out
in a wilderness area they they pour
[SPEAKER_01]: diluted molasses into the soil to
stimulate the bacterial population that
[SPEAKER_00]: will consume the oil I didn't know that no
what I was getting at is you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for the the bacteria to wrap to
multiply so rapidly that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually create a temperature increase in
the soil around the root zone which could
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the plants to suffer or that the
bacteria could be more efficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: accessing that food source to where it
could pull nitrogen and other nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: from what the plant could access yeah that
that's a possibility for sure that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I was I was trying to get at just
to caution listeners yeah well you caution
[SPEAKER_01]: with everything the same thing can happen
if you if you put mix like wood chips or
[SPEAKER_01]: something into your soil once wood chips
that are not composted or aged the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing can happen the the bacteria and
maybe fungi will use up all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: available nitrogen in an effort to to
degrade that those wood chips and so then
[SPEAKER_01]: they they lock it away from the plant
that's why I don't like the idea of of
[SPEAKER_01]: burying things down in the soil for the
the plant to come upon sometime in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future or whatever because that that's
always a possibility for that to occur if
[SPEAKER_01]: you put some sort of raw organic matter
down there that that is not stable are you
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about hugo culture beds are you
talking about the layers that I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the like the rev had recommended
with the true living organics or some some
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah the the layers sort of thing the
spikes some some guys say that they they
[SPEAKER_01]: have great success if they put a dead
animal at the bottom of the pit before
[SPEAKER_01]: they plant and stuff and and sometimes
that works out great you know it's just it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost seems like it's happenstance that
sometimes there's a lock up and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: there isn't I've been caught for sure with
my pants down with that one by by mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in too soon okay so let's let's
change direction a little bit here and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little about soil testing so I know
that certain groups like in the past I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard some people claim that if all the
nutrients we need are already in soils we
[SPEAKER_00]: just need to add the right microbial
populations they'll make these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: available while there's other groups that
will say hey if we get the right mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content and balanced in the soil and
everything is you know the soils minerally
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced then these microbes are just
going to appear and start reproducing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll have optimal soils can you give
me your sort of take and experience on all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this well I don't think that that every
soil everywhere will produce whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: need just because it has a good microbial
population there may be certain soils in
[SPEAKER_01]: some areas that you can say that about I'm
in this the group or maybe by myself where
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to include as many
diverse nutrient components as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: within reason and and that that's why you
know we we used you know so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things in in our soil mixes like the
different we would take stone from one
[SPEAKER_01]: area and and use the vermicompost and that
sort of thing and that's what I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: is necessary I haven't bought into the
whole balanced soil thing because the way
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking at at the way that
plants and microorganisms work together to
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire the necessary nutrients sort of
goes against that in in my mind because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think what you're saying when you say if
you have a balanced soil and then all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the it'll it'll cause this to release that
and this will be available instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: being locked up and it sort of goes
against the plant being sort of having an
[SPEAKER_01]: influence over its environment and as if
it's just something that's being held up
[SPEAKER_01]: and sucking up nutrients whereas I I think
it really does work kind of the way I I
[SPEAKER_01]: described that the the plant is working in
concert with the microorganisms and the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic materials that are around it and
those can be you know organic matter can
[SPEAKER_01]: be compost vermicompost powdered rock
minerals clay powders whatever which so so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I like to put you know within
reason as much as I can but but balance it
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the soil being able to breathe
and drain and that sort of thing at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time I hope I answered your question
or not you did and you didn't so the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical properties of the soil totally
agree with in terms of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: porosity drainage aeration when we talk
about a soil though let's say you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that is deficient in calcium that
that calcium has to come from somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah absolutely so there is something to
balancing the soil and saying hey I just
[SPEAKER_00]: did a soil test this is obviously low in
calcium I need to raise my calcium levels
[SPEAKER_00]: up to X whatever that level is that you
want to set it at I totally agree with you
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the fact that mineral
balancing is just certain people's best
[SPEAKER_00]: guess whether it's you know Kinsey Solomon
you know Michael Astera all of these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are just you know Carrie Reams they're
trying to guess at what they think is
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal for plant health for various crops
but we don't we don't know there just
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been enough research it seems like
to me in that regard yeah well so I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't said that you shouldn't have
calcium or you shouldn't have all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: components possible what I am saying is
that they they should be there but they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily have to be there in in
the certain ratios that someone has
[SPEAKER_01]: delineated sure yeah that's that's all so
and sure you could end up with some soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's deficient in calcium and then sure
you need to add some component in that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to supply the calcium absolutely so
you're saying don't get too caught up or
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out if your potassium is not at
three to five percent of your CEC or your
[SPEAKER_00]: your calcium is not sixty to seventy
percent and all of that sort of thing yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I mean yes whether I'm I can't
say that I'm a hundred percent right but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's how I grew but definitely
you know you try to include everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can then and it all depends on an
individual circumstances some people can
[SPEAKER_01]: afford to send away to Timbuktu for
whatever ingredient right others like
[SPEAKER_01]: where we were we were on a farm 90 miles
away from the closest town and so we used
[SPEAKER_01]: what was at hand and and made what we
could make lucky I guess we we did have
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the necessary components existent
in the materials that were around the area
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked a little bit about soils and you
talked about the importance of these
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial communities in the soil the way
I met you was actually through a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion board hosted by Jeff Lowenfels
on aerated compost teas and I consider you
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the foremost experts on the
continent when it comes to the subject so
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to kind of dive in a little
bit to that if you have time right now to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss a little bit more about what
aerated compost teas are what they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you what you would recommend for
people that are just starting out in using
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas okay so what is aerated
compost tea it's basically a water base
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got air being pumped into it and
has and it's being agitated and compost is
[SPEAKER_01]: added and the agitation extracts the
microorganisms that are existing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost or vermicompost and a food source
is provided that feeds the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: archaea and fungi that are existent in
your compost and as they multiply that
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulates as I said before the protozoa
to come out of their cysts and begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: divide and multiply as well so over a
period of time the the population expands
[SPEAKER_01]: and reaches a sort of a an approximate
ratio where you have lots of you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: if you use a microscope lots of bacteria
and and protozoa the protozoa are eating
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria so that's when the nutrient
cycling is occurring and it's at its peak
[SPEAKER_01]: and if so that's your purpose for using
the compost tea that is the time to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: it now what's the window when that
generally occurs for me 36 hours is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: safe if you have if you're not using a
microscope that's a good time people talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about different recipes and making a
fungal tea opposed to a bacterial tea and
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway it doesn't really work that way as
far as recipe goes although you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: some influence with the recipe it's more
the timing so obviously if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have straight bacteria in it in a tea it's
it's going to be in the first probably 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours that you want to use it however if
you do have fungi in there in your compost
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be growing at that time as
well so I I've never successfully managed
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a a compost tea that was either
fungal with no bacteria or bacteria with
[SPEAKER_01]: no fungal if they both exist in in the the
compost use they they pretty much grow at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same rate at least in in what I've
done so so if if that's what you want then
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to probably use it between 12 and
18 hours but it's it after 24 hours is
[SPEAKER_01]: usually when the protozoa reach their
their peak or come start multiplying I
[SPEAKER_01]: should say and reach their peak at 36
hours and so if you want a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling that's that's when you use it as
far as methods of making compost tea we
[SPEAKER_01]: made everything we made everything from
you know one liter brewers up to 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons we had straight air stones we we
had you know others that were copies of
[SPEAKER_01]: what other people had made with the air
going down a cylinder that had the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: in it we used venturis which are made with
water pumps and airlifts and airlifts are
[SPEAKER_01]: the most successful way of doing it for
for sure as far as adjectives dictation
[SPEAKER_01]: and as far as dissolved oxygen you know
there's mathematical papers that
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrate an airlift can up the the
dissolved oxygen capacity tenfold from
[SPEAKER_01]: from an air pump that's just blowing into
air stones anyway should I get sidetracked
[SPEAKER_01]: there and forget what I was saying or what
no I think that's I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting I just want to I want to
reiterate that when Tim says that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: tried all these brewers you're also you've
also looked at them under a microscope and
[SPEAKER_00]: you spent hours and hours in your
laboratory it's not a matter of you just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a bucket of brown water and
saying oh this looks good or throwing it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a plant you're actually spending time
looking on slide after slide and examining
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these teas yeah we we we took the
pH and the TDS and everything every single
[SPEAKER_01]: brew I've got several notebooks still full
of all of the the notes from there and
[SPEAKER_01]: took the dissolved oxygen readings of
course and temperature and the whole works
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to back up just a little bit one
thing and you were talking about with this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial dominated or fungally dominated
teas I just want to make it clear when we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about a tea that's fungally dominated
they're still going to be a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria it's not like that like you
mentioned briefly the bacteria is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going away and vice versa and it's really
the brewing length that controls that more
[SPEAKER_00]: more than the recipe right absolutely
great so I just wanted to clarify that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then let's talk a little bit about what
happens when you brew perpetually or you
[SPEAKER_00]: brew longer than 36 hours because I know
this is something that certain companies
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry are promoting that you and
I feel rather strongly about already so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about what happens on a on a
microscopic level well if once you go
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond 48 hours is pretty much a maximum
before the ciliates usually at ciliates
[SPEAKER_01]: start taking over the whole thing it
sometimes it's the flagellates but in my
[SPEAKER_01]: most of my experience ciliates start
coming into play ciliates are the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: protozoa that are sometimes an indication
that there are some anaerobic bacteria in
[SPEAKER_01]: the picture because that's their favorite
food like if you go up to 72 hours or even
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond that you you just end up with a
ciliate soup I've got some video footage
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know I don't know if I ever
showed it to you but it would it blows my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind it's just like the whole slide is
just teeming teeming ciliates it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing if there's someone who has a
perpetual brewer going in in a store and
[SPEAKER_01]: then selling tea to customers I mean
that's possible to do but every 36 to 48
[SPEAKER_01]: hours you really should reconstitute it
and so that means put in some more compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and put in some more feedstock but what
happens is that once you do that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to wait for you know 24 hours
for it to basically go through the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle that it goes through to come back to
be a useful product again so if you're if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a perpetual brewer and you're
selling tea you know pity the customer
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes in after you've just added new
stuff to your brew they're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: something that the dissolved oxygen hasn't
had a chance to build up and the
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms haven't been properly
extracted or multiplied they're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: a totally different product from the
customer who gets it at 36 hours so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong with perpetual brewing if
you're doing it for yourself at home and
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping track and you have a microscope or
even you just want to experiment you know
[SPEAKER_01]: go for it but if you're selling it to
somebody that's that's just not very
[SPEAKER_00]: kosher you bring up a good point though I
found it was very challenging to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain good microbial diversity and
biomass even when adding food stock and
[SPEAKER_00]: using a microscope beyond you know 48
hours so when we were doing those trade
[SPEAKER_00]: shows together for example where we had
the microscope and we had a brew going and
[SPEAKER_00]: we would pull samples and add food stock
and try and maintain the brew even with a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope and looking at the samples
every I don't know 15 20 minutes it was
[SPEAKER_00]: still very challenging to maintain that
compost tea and I didn't really feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: we did all that effectively yeah no no it
wasn't very good no you're right yeah so I
[SPEAKER_00]: totally agree with you that's why when we
brew in our farm we will just tell
[SPEAKER_00]: customers compost tea is available on
Saturdays and that's when they can come in
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be brewing throughout that day they
can get us they can get get some to take
[SPEAKER_00]: home and then we'll shut it down discard
whatever we have and start over again for
[SPEAKER_00]: another day sort of thing yeah that's the
way to do it so some some brewers are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting their they're saying they can put
compost tea in a fridge have you have you
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of that one there's a company oh
yeah yeah I've seen there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on YouTube these days so I just want
to say that that doesn't really work very
[SPEAKER_00]: well either I don't know what you're if
you've experimented with refrigeration or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of that sort of thing yourself yeah we
we did put some in the fridge when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all of our experiments and stuff and
it wasn't worth a damn the the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: basically just die or go dormant and they
don't come back again unless you you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you might get them back again if you add
it into a compost tea and brew it over
[SPEAKER_01]: again when we did have to store some tea
we did it with removing removing the the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost because we it was in a case where
we had it in a bag so we could remove it
[SPEAKER_01]: and and then aerate it and the the longest
I kept it that way was over a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: three days constantly aerating it and even
then it you know slowly degenerated in
[SPEAKER_01]: what you say about putting it in a bottle
you know that may reminds me about you
[SPEAKER_01]: know when people send a sample to to get
tested the whole thing is going to change
[SPEAKER_01]: during the shipment so by the time it's
tested if if you're trying to say well
[SPEAKER_01]: this sample was taken at 12 or 36 or 40
hours by the time it's looked at at the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab it's not going to be that time anymore
it's going to be 50 hours or however long
[SPEAKER_01]: it took to get there and it it will have
transformed I don't know if I should say
[SPEAKER_01]: this but I had a a client who is in a bind
that he had a customer a big customer for
[SPEAKER_01]: landscaping a landscaping deal who
insisted that he would not contract with
[SPEAKER_01]: him unless he had a good test result from
a lab so he asked me what's what he should
[SPEAKER_01]: do and so I said well just brew for eight
hours put it in the bottle and ship it and
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time it gets there it'll be good
and so that's what he did and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect and he got really great test
results and got the contract yeah I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a challenging aspect with the
whole idea of testing and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and I like to point out to
people who are doing those types of tests
[SPEAKER_00]: that not only does it have the challenges
that you just listed but you change one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about your brew that snapshot really
doesn't allow us to make useful decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field in terms of how to improve
our compost teas in my opinion and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I think having a microscope is so
useful if you if you really want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that aspect of growing one thing I do
want to bring up that you kind of hinted
[SPEAKER_00]: at there is I don't want to discourage
growers from experimenting with compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas and trying them out on their plants
and it's really hard it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: truly screw up yeah it's very difficult to
make a bad compost tea yes I tried the
[SPEAKER_01]: adage of having an anaerobic stinky tea
and dumping it on a plant that I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill and the plant actually loved it so
anyway one thing I wanted to bring up is
[SPEAKER_01]: is recipes that's something else I've sort
of learned in my old age is that I seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: get just as good results from just using
vermicompost with molasses and you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: do have the recipes that are on my webpage
that a lot of people just they say that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they use they stand by it it's great
and all that but you know all power to
[SPEAKER_01]: them and and there if they like it stick
with it but but for me I found that I'm I
[SPEAKER_01]: stop including all of the things like rock
phosphate and kelp meal and and fish
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrolysis and just stuck with the
molasses and and vermicompost and got
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same microbial population
growing in in there so sure yeah we use a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that we call our microbe catalyst
with ours as a food source not because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's anything wrong with molasses but
just because it's a dried granule and
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses is hard for us to package and
ship but when I do a lot of my microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: testing I actually use molasses and you
showed me that and I I will say I do
[SPEAKER_00]: really like to use organic alfalfa meal in
addition to molasses and vermicompost as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of your recipe when I use your recipe
but just the molasses and vermicompost
[SPEAKER_01]: works really really well too yeah well
molasses has got a bad rap somehow well I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it all started with some testing
that was done in two different labs one
[SPEAKER_01]: was a USDA lab another was a Canadian
agricultural lab and they were you know
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to show that E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli would grow in aerated compost tea and
they I can't remember exactly but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: both of them had some sort of setup where
they were using jars with air stones which
[SPEAKER_01]: is okay you know just for experimental
purposes but they they also in inoculated
[SPEAKER_01]: both both labs inoculated with E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and so if you put E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli into an aerated liquid water and and
give it food like molasses of course it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow you know there any any kind
of bacteria is is going to grow so that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I thought was very flawed with
it and and it actually you know within the
[SPEAKER_01]: in people's minds became so serious that I
think it was what what's the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: branch of the USDA called the NLP yeah
when they had the compost tea councils
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that and and they because of those
lab results they said you shouldn't use
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses in in compost tea out of all this
fear mongering about E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli growing and so it just that a lot of
people are saying never use it because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and it's just in my mind just a kind
of a silly knee-jerk reaction and and as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know it it it feeds fungi
just as well as it does bacteria so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very useful food stock to use yeah
I would say that's one of the the myths
[SPEAKER_00]: that you sort of help dispel or challenge
over the last decade another one is
[SPEAKER_00]: foaming I know when I first got in the
industry everyone was talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have a good head of foam on
your compost tea like it was a beer or
[SPEAKER_00]: something you were able to show from
looking under the microscope that that
[SPEAKER_01]: really wasn't the case yeah well both
things are still rampantly running going
[SPEAKER_01]: by rumor everywhere and it couldn't say I
have to keep repeating that but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean anything but I don't want
to keep you for too much longer here Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate you taking the time
today and maybe we can do a follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: interview to kind of hash out some more of
these topics here in the future thanks Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget to check out Tim's website
www.microbeorganics.com for more
[SPEAKER_00]: information microscope videos and images
he is the inventor of the 50 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: microbialator and the five gallon mini
microbialator both currently available on
[SPEAKER_00]: our website he also has a microbe
identification DVD that helps farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying various microbes under the
microscope available on his website for
[SPEAKER_00]: only $40 this DVD was very helpful to me
because the microbes don't hold still on
[SPEAKER_00]: the slide so it is much more useful to see
video than still images you can also read
