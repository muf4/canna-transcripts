[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Steve Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve is a former mixed martial artist and
entrepreneur known for his time in the UFC
[SPEAKER_01]: and his involvement with green life
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve was born in Long Beach, California,
and he began training in martial arts at a
[SPEAKER_01]: young age and developed a passion for
combat sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2005, Cantwell made his professional
MMA debut and quickly gained attention for
[SPEAKER_01]: his aggressive fighting style and
well-rounded skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: He amassed an impressive record in
regional promotions, which led to his
[SPEAKER_01]: signing with the UFC in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: In recent years, Cantwell has focused his
entrepreneurial endeavors, particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He founded Green Life Productions in 2014,
a prominent Las Vegas-based cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation company.
[SPEAKER_01]: GLP is known for its organic and
sustainable approach to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, producing high quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cantwell's involvement with GLP has
allowed him to combine his passion for
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurship with his interest in
health and wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: His contributions to the company reflect
his ongoing dedication to promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and responsible practices
within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, let's talk cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a big proponent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few commercial facilities
that I see successfully running cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crops indoors and showing it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of guys I've worked with that
have tried it and failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge proponent of cover crops
indoors, not because I don't think they
[SPEAKER_01]: have some benefits, but for me,
the cons outweigh the pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about what those pros and
cons are and why it works so well for you
[SPEAKER_01]: and your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, if you plan on using cover
crops, listen to everything Tad says,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you don't, you're going to make
him write, because everything he says has
[SPEAKER_00]: a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not making stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk a thin line when rubbing cover
crops indoors, and cover crops in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's definitely some people
who kind of overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have too much fun with it,
and they create more work and
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility than is intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we run a very basic cover crop,
and I do mix it up from time to time based
[SPEAKER_00]: off of what we're facing both indoors and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I see the benefit
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not a perfect process,
but nothing in farming is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits that we find from it,
again, I feel like it creates this
[SPEAKER_00]: shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This living mulch creates this shelter
over my soil that keeps my soil organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're supposed to be in the soil
and keeps things from just blowing up all
[SPEAKER_00]: over my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge component in the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we spend a lot of money on
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in veg, my cannabis plants aren't
catching all that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I let it hit that soil, I'm just
wasting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the idea of cover crops and
catching that light and photosynthesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: and turning it into energy that my soil
and plants can use further at a further
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel a little bit of efficiency
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just worth the squeeze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it's just one thing
I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a part of my IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll plant specific cover crops to
attract pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll plant cover crops to repel pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had a rat issue real bad one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year of the rat or like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the year of the rat and it hit this
whole town hardcore and got some rats in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started noticing some predator packs
would get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we quickly started doing some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, the way it works, what's the
natural predator for a rat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a cat and put it to the cat next
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some in our warehouse and then we
planted mints in our bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I blew out my whole beds with mints and
the rats never came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen after mints took over our beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never seen a single rat in this
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I let the mints get too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't cold the mints in time and that
shit's super invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to pull a bunch of mints out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I had to learn how to better manage
that mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good for one thing, but a double
edged sword, it turned around and it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of bit me in the butt on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to use a can of cover
crops, I recommend picking with like one
[SPEAKER_00]: basic variety with like a Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your blanket cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really serve a whole lot of
purposes other than just covering the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you start to add other little
things, have a reason for it and then have
[SPEAKER_00]: a place for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't judge a fish by how well it
climbed the tree because you have it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the water, then see how well it
swims, then make your judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if you have a purpose for
these cover crop or these companion plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put them in the right place,
then they can add value to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just going in there and
throwing seeds, doing the little salt dust
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and just having this beautiful lush
cover crops of flowers everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks good for IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my most high tracks and pictures
are ones of miracles in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you're creating
more work than you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole idea of creating these systems
is to create systems that manage
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's why I love worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I were to pay somebody to do a
worm's job, they wouldn't do it as good
[SPEAKER_00]: and it costs a whole lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding these systems that are easy to
manage, that make life easier,
[SPEAKER_00]: not harder, it's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we walk it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the other benefits that I
don't know if you touched on were water
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to keep that initial level of
the soil, the first couple inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by keeping active plants in there and
roots, you're probably getting better
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycling in that soil before the
cannabis plant really has a chance to take
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some more pros of cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I look at it as like diversity
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more diversity, diversity is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to have more diverse cover crop
or more diverse plants in the system that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to attract and grow different
microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to have as many as I can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take care of plants in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now we're gearing up to do our
marigold runs again, to get some flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the rooms again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In springtime every year, I cut back and I
just run a Dichondra and wood chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize any potential risk from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything I do is more of a trap
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put me the trap plant in the
corner of the room for my cover crop or
[SPEAKER_00]: for my companion plant that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think as long as you're
mulching, I'm just proponent of mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're okay, whether it's living
mulch or brown mulch, whatever the case
[SPEAKER_00]: may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a huge proponent for covering
your soil in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, obviously I'm a cover crop guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, the first time I saw
cover crops was my buddy Brad Thurman
[SPEAKER_00]: showed me Matt Davenport's Instagram like
eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has some clovers in the bottom of
his pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was the stupidest thing I
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, these lazy dudes aren't even
pulling weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stealing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all these things went off and here I
am eight years later, kind of known for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the first time I thought I saw it,
I was like, oh, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I kind of backed off and changed
my mind over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you covered the reasons
folks would choose to use cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give my thoughts, but before I
do, what cover crops will you not use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned some that you really like,
but what will you just never use as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop besides mint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll use mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just make sure I coal it at the end
of every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't let it grow so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mint, I still think mint has a
value in the system, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in an area where there's rats or things
like that, it could definitely help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't let it grow wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely want to chop and drop it,
pull it back, coal it as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cover crop that I won't use indoors,
I'm about to use it outdoors, I won't use
[SPEAKER_00]: it indoors ever again, is clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's too much risk versus reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot easier ways to get
nitrogen back into the system than
[SPEAKER_00]: attracting pests and disease like clover
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we ever had a pest outbreak,
it fed off the clover heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eventually culled all the clover
from all of our soils, placed it with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really likes Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, shit may linger on Dichondra a
little bit, but nothing's going out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their way for Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of been the ground cover
that we choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover is done though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I wouldn't use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, crawling stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's going to crawl out the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, when you're growing 500 plants,
you can't afford to be pulling bean stalks
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these little vets and all these
little crazy things out of your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use things that are definitely
low-laying cover crops for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I mean, again,
time and place for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I will say, I think you brought
up another good point, and that is that
[SPEAKER_01]: use your cover crop with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cover crops have different purposes,
whether that's to break up the soil better
[SPEAKER_01]: or to add nitrogen or to create more
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to grow a different cover
crop for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no perfect cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people will run multi-species
cover crops outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love cover crops outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they make a ton of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this reason is why I don't like
cover crops indoors so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then growers can make their own
decisions based on their own facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because someone used cover crops,
I don't think they're a bad grower or that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're making a bad decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think people need to be educated on
why they do what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me with cover crops, it's another
crop that you have to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a commercial facility, that can be
problematic because you already have your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands full a lot of times managing your
cannabis plant, your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's bringing in your revenue and
your own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, I really like to mix
my nutrients into the soil to get it back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the rhizosphere as fast as possible
because we're cropping five cycles a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going a little faster than what
you're doing at Greenlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to get those nutrients
right into the rhizosphere where the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like a little bit of disturbance in
my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned this whole idea of cannabis
being a little more bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a problem with a little bit
of soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not tilling my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, we're not using a mechanical
tiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just digging in some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a very different
process that people don't consider when
[SPEAKER_01]: they talk about tilling versus no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not tilling indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that cannabis agriculture in
general is artificial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selecting for a crop here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the diversity that we have in a given
indoor space or even outdoors is not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be anywhere near the diversity that we
see in a healthy forest ecosystem or a
[SPEAKER_01]: prairie land or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to pull what practices we can
from nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mother nature is amazing and we
want to use those practices, but we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to use them strategically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not creating flood events or blasting
my plants with wind because tornado may
[SPEAKER_01]: occur in nature, these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to be aware that what we're
doing is artificial and we're doing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense of trying to create the best
yields and the best plants that we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just because it's a business,
but also because we're growing this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because we love it and it's medicine for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last point that I have around
cover crops for me is we're growing this
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors in controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one more variable that we have
to add to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's already so many variables in
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the risk of the pest
pressures that it may bring in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned cover crops of clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain immediately goes to thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the risk of having that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought of one other point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last thing is hop late in viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to now pull roots because we know
that hop latent is in higher viroid levels
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the root system than in the leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can test for that better by testing
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to pull the roots to lower the
viral load in my soil because at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the day, I'm not ready to throw this
whole living soil methodology out just
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have hop late in viroid now in
most facilities and it's such a problem in
[SPEAKER_01]: our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, you jumped to the hop
latent thing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ready for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's back up a little bit though so we
can tackle that one too though.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point though, yeah, if you're
trying to use cover crops, the whole idea
[SPEAKER_00]: is, like you said, we have a whole lot to
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to manage a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be regenerative, you have to
be sustainable and run a good business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you have to walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my situation, I'm literally setting up
the easiest self-managing cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: in the whole facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not planting it throughout my whole
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planting it very specific areas like
at the end, the corners of our beds while
[SPEAKER_00]: planting like marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at old GLP photos,
start to look at where some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: marigolds or some more of our more
companion, not cover crops, but our
[SPEAKER_00]: companion plants are placed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're then placed in a high traffic area
where it's easy for us to manage them,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's easy for us to see if there's a
problem or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to minimize the workload at 100%
because there's a lot going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with the whole regulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these crazy things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to simplify,
take the best of what we can learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go a little bit further with it than
some do, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not to say that I'm just going
willy-nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just getting lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we do has an SOP designed
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we manage these things very,
very, very thoroughly and precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people doing things that I
was doing eight years ago, but just going
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crazy with their cover crops and I'm
stoked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I hope they're learning and
they're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I expect to see those people in years
to come sharpen their sticks a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and minimize some of those potential risks
like you talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember some of the other points
now because I'm stuck on the Hop Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroid part of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw a lot at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your points are good though and
validated points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just see them a little bit
differently as far as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to them goes and how to use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the Hop Latin Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first opened up, correct me if I'm
wrong, but I think back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody was referring to them as duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Pipsweed was a dude online and we
called them duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called them over here at GLP,
we called them shiners, back to that pure
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine strain in medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, pure sunshine had a
Hop Latin Viroid real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time I plant in a bed,
it would dud out like 50, 60% of that bed
[SPEAKER_00]: would dud out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was a virus because I
didn't see it spreading to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like two years, I thought it was
like a mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, it was a mutation,
it was a Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all these topics or all these
conversations going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on team mutation based off of
what I was seeing on my commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought if it was a virus, it would
spread like wildfire throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wasn't seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eventually pulled the pure sunshine
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't grow it no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just too much of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest, I don't see it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to see the occasional dudding
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to see the occasional sick plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't see it no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the living organic system,
and I leave roots in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as root balls go, yeah,
you have a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early on, we would harvest our root
balls to make room for the next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out that we were doing
is we were harvesting the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: life that we just grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worms, the bacteria, the fungi,
those are all nesting right there feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: off those exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we removed that root ball,
we just kind of took two steps back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took one step forward, two steps back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got so bad to where our worms
population, our beds was almost none,
[SPEAKER_00]: just harvesting the root balls over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we started designing our
grid technique where we plant here one
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, the next cycle we plant right next
to it, allowing this root ball to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down and letting all the biology do its
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't have dudding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a dudding plant since I got
rid of pure sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not to say that this virus
isn't real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just believe that, hey, it's always been
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think certain plants are going to hold
certain viral loads more than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had it my way, every plant in my
facility would be, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: immune, but would have a load,
would have to be able to tolerate this
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'm not have to worry about it
because I've seen people that tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, 100% of their propagation method
is through tissue culture because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a bit overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've literally walked in some of the most
highest state of the art facilities with
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% tissue culture propagation process
and sealed rooms, this and sealed rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're showing this whole tissue
culture set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go to one of their flower rooms
and it looks like a powdered donut factory
[SPEAKER_00]: because their facility has powdered milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not their plants and things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it, viruses are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not to belittle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a bit of a, of a scare tactic
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from a commercial perspective,
I just don't see it as much as I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: when I got rid of the strains that
contained it or that showed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's not even really a topic
here at GOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see it no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is, there is research to
show that certain genetics are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: not express it as much based on the work
by Dr. Poonja.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next podcast, it's actually going to
come out before this one will be all on
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned a lot on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dieting thing I think is interesting
because like from working closely with my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy, Justin at Mako Farms and he
absolutely has it because we've tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He finds that he can keep the plants
healthy and not stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't see that expression of,
of dieting or the viroid itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you, I think if we can keep a
plant healthy and reduce stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to see that expression of
it because it is a latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming in with clean plants,
even if your bed is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had plants with roots that had the
viroid, you're still able, he,
[SPEAKER_01]: he crops huge, huge yields and pulls a ton
of biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other reason I like to pull roots
because you mentioned the worms thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons I like to pull roots is
because of heavy metals as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lowering viral load, removing heavy
metals from the system through,
[SPEAKER_01]: through biomass again, I think is
important if, if that's an issue for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for us with the worms,
what we see is we see a lot of our worms
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up on the blue soak tape or where
the irrigation systems are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if because of your watering
and I guess you're watering the whole bed
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have cover crops in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought was maybe a lot of your worm
populations are going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated in the root ball versus what
we're seeing and being more along where
[SPEAKER_01]: the irrigation lines are run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I haven't noticed a large,
a large change in worm populations based
[SPEAKER_01]: off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long were, but you were probably
shaking the roots back into the bed or
[SPEAKER_00]: the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so when we harvest, typically we,
you know, you, you get the plant out and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you shake off the soil and then you
take the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not getting all the root hairs
and everything out of the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a pretty quick, simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours are a little bit different,
but real quick back to the virus too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about setting the stage too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you, you know, people always
ask, Oh, you have all these bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi and how do they not, how do these
bad ones not take over?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you not get, but try this,
how do you not get a hot black
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you not get all these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cause I'm not setting the stage for
those things that we try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a healthy aerobic environment,
full of diversity of beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, typically you have to set
the stage, extend similar to the whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't judge a fish by how well it climbs a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep that fish in the water,
it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I keep that cat out of the
water in the tree, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just setting the stage for,
for, for whatever it is that you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do for the proper outcome, I think is
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good air circulation, good filtration,
good, healthy aerobic soil, good,
[SPEAKER_00]: good, good compost, all these things,
good practices are going to help set the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you're willy nilly and going in
there, you know, hand watering without a
[SPEAKER_00]: meter, you're not following the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing all these crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy, cool kid techniques you see on the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you setting the stage for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've brought up your SOPs multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a recent podcast with Cassandra
Maffey, just talking about SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people give enough credit to
how important SOPs are and following them
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's, I think that's what makes,
separates kind of like a good grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: a great grower or a bad grower from a good
grower is having SOPs and following them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's definitely key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't grow, for the most part,
I don't grow cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow employees and they follow SOPs that
I wrote and it's clutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if something goes wrong,
we can look back to, Hey, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you follow the SOP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can always kind of find the problem
that way and work towards a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also state regulators,
they're going to ask for SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when state regulators come in and
especially that they've only seen clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile grows, and they start seeing all
this crazy cover crops and beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects everywhere, they're going to want
to see SOPs that show that you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: control of these things, that you're in
control of these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they're going to need
everything to pass some disease and shut
[SPEAKER_00]: you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SOPs are definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate writing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is really big on SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just raised her hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kwan Yin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of her strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes my craziness and then makes it
legal, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: She puts it into regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give a shout out to your wife
because I know she does a lot behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're the face of GLP,
but I know that she's really the heart of
[SPEAKER_01]: it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think she gets enough credit
for everything she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lays low.
[SPEAKER_00]: She stays out of the limelight deal,
but she's definitely... I basically built
[SPEAKER_00]: her business, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built a business for her to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like we covered a lot in this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we absolutely need to talk
about, though, before signing off is
[SPEAKER_01]: bottomless pots and this tech that you
came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you share your thought process
and then how it's been working in reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first started GLP, we were
digging half gallon pots into our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dig out the soil we took out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then go into a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a pot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we took out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then go into the next cycle of edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our whole process for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when we started harvesting
our worms and things like that by taking
[SPEAKER_00]: out the old roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we designed a grid pattern to
where you plant here one cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant here the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just constantly switching grids
each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were still digging holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still quite a bit of soil
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to stay true to the whole no till
or no soil disturbance scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just never felt right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt like we were taking a step
back every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day I had a seed plant in a
small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to transplant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got busy, forgot to transplant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down on the mother bed, never got
around to it, and came back a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant was totally stressed out
and yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week later, it was just completely blown
up, re-greened, super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to grab it to move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was stuck to the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, this is kind of like
the old rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the little rock wool and the big
rock wool kind of technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my gears just started rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking about all the labor we can
save if we didn't have to dig holes and
[SPEAKER_00]: the mess that we wouldn't have to make if
we didn't have to dig holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just took, I think it was 12
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the bottoms off plastic pots,
set them on a saucer, fill them with soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some clones into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the root ball develop at the bottom
to where it kind of held all the soil at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're just able to simply pick
them up and then set them on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beds, not dig a single hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants would just continue
growing downward, which would continue
[SPEAKER_00]: going downward into the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we first did this, all I was
thinking was reducing labor was the main
[SPEAKER_00]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we achieved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What took us a day and a half turned into
a half day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two female growers that run my
entire facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them a half day to place,
we call it placing a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't plant, we place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, we started with a small bed
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show it at first, so I was too
embarrassed to for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make sure it works because nobody
was doing this at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to put my foot in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually did it for about a year or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started seeing pictures of
the bed in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started asking questions, what's going
on over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the whole grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to Tyler from grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him make a fabric version of the pot
without a bottom on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys are awesome, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you need, those guys are willing
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty cool and very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so we ran with the bottomless pot
technique and just kind of designed the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole system off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we kind of learned was,
yes, it's going to drastically save the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of labor and the amount of mess you
make, the amount of soil disturbance,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely going to cut back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then to our surprise is we got faster,
better growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to reduce the amount of
transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have seemed to just take off
faster and healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my system, we can't really shed time
off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get 4.3 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cycles a year, just to be clear on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get 13 harvests a year is what I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't really afford to shave time
the way my systems work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seasons set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my seasons don't wait for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants don't wait for the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a clockwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running the same schedule for
eight and a half years now without missing
[SPEAKER_00]: a single beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what I was saying with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we at about that?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you covered a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you originally started as a
labor-saving thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it became an actual better,
not only was it saving labor, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: also giving you better yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I couldn't save time because of our
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did was in the same amount of
time I had allocated to grow my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: my vegetable plants, I was able to grow my
plants twice as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't save me time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, we're kind of set on a
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did get more out of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants just went into flower much
bigger, much healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen a huge increase in yields
by doing it over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place I would say it might not
work, one, if you're a home gardener and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a small sale, maybe ceiling height
is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not the best technique for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a large-scale commercial
grower, you're planting thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a month, and you have high-based
ceilings, I definitely think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: technique worth trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it on one bed first or try it on one
pot first.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be surprised on how easy and
how simple the whole thing works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely something I want to
play around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really interesting concept
and very ingenious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, hats off to you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I had is, what lessons have
you learned in terms of tips and pointers
[SPEAKER_01]: for people who want to try it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain size pot that you think
works best?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, any watering differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say make sure you clear the
soil off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be setting it on like,
if you're running a living mulch or any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of mulch, you don't want to set it on
top of your mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause decomposing in the
root zone, rotting and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a nice little access point to the
soil, straight into the soil when you set
[SPEAKER_00]: it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend watering the pots directly at
least a couple of times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first week and a half,
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the plants time for their roots to
grow into the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get quite enough capillary
action to water up through those pots from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to water them
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the roots get into the bed,
you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of ignore the pots and just
focus on the bed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, yeah, it's pretty
self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a video on my Instagram that kind of
explained it and people asked me all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and it looks like I don't answer,
but all I do is I tag them in the original
[SPEAKER_00]: video so that I don't have to explain the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to ask me online anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to tag you in the original
video and you can watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 10 minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives a whole detailed breakdown on
what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much has changed since I made that
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anything has really changed
since the making of that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still running it very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our state regulators hated the idea of
bottomless pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fought insanely hard on the idea for
absolutely no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they actually even called Tyler and
they had all kinds of weird, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's a validated technique that
you can use in Nevada that they aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing with anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wanted to talk to the manufacturer
of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to understand these regulators,
they come in, they walk a thousand rows
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all sterile chemical
facilities and they walk into GLP and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like, what is this place?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way any of this is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always this huge learning curve
that we have to walk them through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last year, this new regulators
and the CCB in Nevada have been extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've spent a lot of time educating
them on just organics in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody's sake, because a lot of
these regulating bodies are going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the same regulations and just kind of
repeat them over and over again to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one state is successful in
something, then the other states doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to the sarsapagillus thing,
you need to nip this in the ass before
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis becomes fairly legal,
because then we ain't going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, yeah, bottomless
pots for the win for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny because people see us
online and I guess we have personas or we
[SPEAKER_01]: share what we do and what we believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people think that we don't agree on a
lot of stuff or that we're opposed to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, at the end of the day,
we're all trying to promote regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, sustainable agriculture,
organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all on the same side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love being able to have these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the things I struggle with
online, and it's really discouraging,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I bet you see this too, is anyone can
leave a comment on your video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can make a comment on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be jerks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can say whatever they want and be
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your career.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what feeds your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put a lot of your passion into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be really discouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to have a civil
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal attacks come into play,
other things that aren't related to the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that people like yourself that
I can have a conversation with and stay on
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, even if we have slight differences
in opinion, that level of respect goes a
[SPEAKER_01]: long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not too many people's opinion
I appreciate or respect more than yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I started off saying it's like
if people don't listen to you and consider
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're saying, they're only going to
prove you right as far as no cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to listen to everything you say,
everything you've ever said, whether I
[SPEAKER_00]: disagree with it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take into consideration and kind
of push me to either level up or even
[SPEAKER_00]: change some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you challenged me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people like this podcast,
we'll have to follow up with other topics
[SPEAKER_01]: and other conversations because I think
it's a lot of fun and I enjoy the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one question for you before we go,
because you mentioned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut this out later if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a video earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about teas and you had
mentioned a manure tea that people do and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it could have certain contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say something to some
people real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we don't like talking regulations
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last two years, I've learned
some really important things for a food
[SPEAKER_00]: wave community that you all need to take
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain guidelines in the in
regulations that we have to follow that no
[SPEAKER_00]: one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the state tried to shut me down,
one of the things that they quoted me on
[SPEAKER_00]: was I think it was a there was an NOP
water guideline quality was an NOP,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an NOP water quality guidelines
saying you have to have below a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli and this other type of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for you to do a compost tea,
you have to have a you have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic or a validated method of
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to use like a thermophilic
compost so that that could be a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of QNF guys to use their IMOs
and and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that there's an issue with
those techniques, but I'm saying if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not validated by the USDA or NOP,
you're not going to be able to use them
[SPEAKER_00]: much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now, once you get a validated method
like thermophilic composting, you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a good high quality compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you make a tea brew and you have to
make two separate tea brews with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe and get them both tested by a third
party lab to show that they're below a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli in a camera where the other bacteria
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you do that, you cannot legally use
a compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now extracts without brewing you can use
without limitation if you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But teas you have to get tested by a third
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throwing that out there guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it and it's a yearly thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in that's in the state of Nevada
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's it's actually it's actually
NOP type USDA Water Guideline thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a national restriction
that the state of Nevada found and just
[SPEAKER_00]: try to hold me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for months before we found out how
to use Chris on hook and clean green
[SPEAKER_00]: certified to actually find the regulation
they were speaking of because they
[SPEAKER_00]: misquoted the number and just sent us on
this rat race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people just got to realize that like
the doctor layning him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of hinted at it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things you do like with
counting in science and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: these regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't count it, it's not science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's neuroscience and you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why a lot of those crazy things
I don't really sign up for so much are
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they do kind of make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: under the right perspective, under the
realm of regulation, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful if you're out there,
if you're using these Valdez techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to write SOPs based off of
something you did in your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a look, take a time to look into
USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a fan of USDA regulations or
any regulations for that matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's worth looking into before
designing an entire system around
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that may not be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, there are NOP guidelines
that actually, I don't know if they've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to apply these to you, but I think
it's 60 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't apply a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a standard NOP guideline
that's been around for decades just to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, salmonella contamination on leafy
greens and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, again, that's a
compost tea regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's also if you're using
manure in your compost or animal
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts, I think is when that one comes
into play, if I'm not mistaken,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact verbiage in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I know there's 100% little
tricks like that you have to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a cash crop, so it's
becoming more and more popular and more
[SPEAKER_00]: money, more problems for the organic
grower, I'll tell you that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just helps to be aware of these
things for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend people getting online,
just kind of looking at USDA regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of applying that to their
facility as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the long term success of their
facility at a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the regulatory side is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the actual risk associated with
compost teas is significantly lower than
[SPEAKER_01]: is stated by a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's this idea that people need to
move to a compost extract from a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that can make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But aerated compost teas in general have
so much more microbial activity and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have a lot of benefit when
you use the right compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the key to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a brewer that's going to create the
optimal dissolved oxygen levels that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, my dad did testing with Elaine
decades ago where they intentionally
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the Kiss Brewer that they used
and found that E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli couldn't survive in some of these
highly aerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I think the risk is
overstated, but it's absolutely there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the failures I hear for people
failing for E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli in agriculture were actually from
having cows upstream that were crapping in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that irrigation water gets pumped
onto the leaves of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plants get, the lettuce and
stuff gets hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, manures are definitely something
that people need to be careful with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think we should probably do
some more posts on compost tea because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think less is more as far as their food
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot of problem people have
is they overfeed their compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes anaerobic before they can get
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now they're just kind of
watering, you know, some ciliate poop soup
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the main thing is like on
commercial scale, extract teas are harder
[SPEAKER_00]: to mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I could brew a bad tea and have to
dump it down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my garden, my growers are all certified
on the Elaine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know how to use a microscope and
check teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like human pathogens,
we've never had an issue with human
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always has been with the wrong
organisms as far as like ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been the main game changer for a
good tea versus a bad tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very efficient nutrient cyclers
in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, compost teas for four years,
extracts for drenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of our routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think people realize just how
much fertility they're bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes with these compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably getting nitrates as well
as other minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've seen people that are like,
we didn't do anything this cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: but compost teas and their soil tests show
an increase in fertility at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes with nitrogen being like way too
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is something that I want to mention
for folks that are considering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of these KNF options,
some of the compost teas, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract or an aerated compost tea,
you are bringing in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can impact your plant for better
or for worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it's for the better,
but it's something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you're chopping and
dropping your cover crops, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven weeks in the flower, you're going to
create some microbial explosion in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrient cycling is going to take
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be counterproductive to what
you're trying to achieve as far as growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a good taste in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've heard, I haven't, I've never
tried a GLP flower, but everyone I've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to that has tried it says that it
is, it's top shelf and it's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, hats off to you and your crew
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your time today.
