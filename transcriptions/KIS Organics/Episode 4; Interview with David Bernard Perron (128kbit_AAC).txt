[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest today is David Bernard Perrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: David is an agrologist and has a master of
science in plant sciences from McGill
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He began working in greenhouse production
in 2001 and worked for McGill in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses and Horticultural Research
Center for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the lead agrologist and one of the
head growers at Whistler Medical Marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last year and a half,
he designed the Certified Organic Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Program at Whistler Medical Marijuana
Corporation, making them the only fully
[SPEAKER_01]: certified organic license producer in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey David, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you taking the time to chat
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Tad, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I met David, what, two years ago
now at CannaCon and came to one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: talks and we started chatting and I
realized David was this wealth of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you maybe tell me a little bit about
your background and how you came into your
[SPEAKER_01]: current job and what you do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we first met, you were
that breath of fresh air and that
[SPEAKER_00]: maelstrom of craziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first two weeks in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that was your first two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, it was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming from an agricultural
background, greenhouse production
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working in greenhouse production
since 2001 when I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the end of my road where I used
to grow up in the countryside,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a greenhouse that we're doing
production of annual flowers in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: and cuttings of poinsettias during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was lucky enough that one of the
managers there was also teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural school close by and he
really interested me and got my eyes open
[SPEAKER_00]: on all the science and the cool stuff
happening in the plants world and the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse management and from the
profitability to how we even need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants happy and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really the high opener for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stayed in this world that led me also
to do my bachelor degree in plant science
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when I was just for fun,
I was growing a lot of mushroom at
[SPEAKER_00]: university, oyster mushroom and all sorts
of stuff and one of the professors saw my
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been offered a master in organic
agriculture and then ended up in grad
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I was bumming around every
summer on the West Coast because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: originally from Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I decided to go and establish
myself on the West and meeting someone
[SPEAKER_00]: rock climbing and then keeping in touch
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard through the grape wines through
the years that he was doing something with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got in touch with him once I moved
to the West Coast and he led me into
[SPEAKER_00]: Worcester Medical Marijuana Corporation,
which is the only certified organic
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed producer in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working at this facility right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your role at the facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the lead agrologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed, with your help and advice,
the organic growing program there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the place certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the growing practices, nutrient
management, soil recycling, climate
[SPEAKER_00]: control, pest and disease management,
scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that touched the plant side
of things, I managed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've essentially shown and proven
that organic cultivation for cannabis can
[SPEAKER_01]: work on a large commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, we're fairly a fairly
small player in the industry, but still we
[SPEAKER_00]: have one of the strongest brand in Canada
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everywhere we go, it's always a treat
to hear the people saying that we're one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best product available out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're a firm believer in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the importance of providing clean
medicine to your patients essentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've seen it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I talk about it with other
people and when we compare our lab results
[SPEAKER_00]: from Anandya Lab, Anandya is a really
great lab on UBC campus that's managed by
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan Page, one of the guys that was
one of the first to sequence cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very high terpene contents
compared to other producer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is very clean and people really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think organic is a big thing behind
it to produce that higher concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that other, like for more plain
vanilla fertilizer can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the premise then is that there's more
benefit to organics because we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: all the mechanisms for which cannabinoids
are necessarily the most beneficial to a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organics, can you expand on that a
little bit just to explain to our users
[SPEAKER_01]: how the microbiology involved in organic
production can affect terpene levels in
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some people that are growing
with our program as well that have done
[SPEAKER_00]: side by side trials, growing with our
organic methods and with some conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: three part nutrients with a few additive
and the terpenes were higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way it works, the way I like to see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you mentioned, we don't fully
understand what's going into the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those soil microorganisms,
we simply cannot culture them in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's hard to study them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we build our soil, when we build our
living soil, the way we see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put all the best player in place,
then we let the plant choose the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction that they want to favorize,
develop depending on which life cycle they
[SPEAKER_00]: are already in vegetative growth,
reproductive stage or they're in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: senescent stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by letting the plant choose whatever it
wants from the soil, encouraging which
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of group of microbes do they want to
encourage bacteria, fungi, actinoma I see,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really get what they need when they
need it and we're not force feeding any
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the plant because they are in
a plant available form and they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed into the plant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are often asking me in
organic, how do you flush your plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is we don't really flush
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a concept that I think it's
because people put too much nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: keep fertilizing too late in the life of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just let the plant do what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to pump some of the sugar
from the photosynthesize into the root
[SPEAKER_00]: exudate, encouraging specific type of
microorganism that it can choose what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of sugar it puts in the rhizosphere and
the roots exudate to promote some specific
[SPEAKER_00]: group and then choosing the type of
nutrients they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just put everything in place and
then let nature do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the plant controls this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting out exudates into the
rhizosphere that control for which
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms make these nutrients
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, I think
that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't fully know, but the latest
research, that's what it showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a very interesting thing that
I came across recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Brasophagy, just plants
engulfing whole microorganism and
[SPEAKER_00]: translocating those microorganisms inside
of vasculature system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole broad range of things
that plant can update from single ions to
[SPEAKER_00]: whole microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're selecting in your living
cell for diversity, a different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: food, a broad variety of input,
nothing in excess, but a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're doing the same thing for your
fungi population, your bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: your actinomycete and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants will really be able to just
have whomever they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have whomever they potentially evolve
with for millions of years to team up with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then maximize their genetic
potential for yield and also terpene and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings up a few questions for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I totally agree with you with what
you're saying here in regards to putting
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel though that, I know a lot of
growers out there want to maximize yield
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're really focused on production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel that you're sacrificing yield
by allowing the plant to naturally senesce
[SPEAKER_01]: or not trying to force feed ionic
nutrients or a bottle of nutrient program
[SPEAKER_01]: onto these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be fully honest, maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about those crazy like above
three pounds of light yields sometime that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to see under my organic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen often like two and a half pound
and more than profitable yield that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the thing that I think,
so when we're growing organically,
[SPEAKER_00]: also there's a price premium attached to
that and there's a quality and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: craftsmanship that goes behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So among the strongest brands that I've
seen are organic and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized for the quality of the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen good production facility
that were producing consistently above
[SPEAKER_00]: three pounds of light according to them,
but they were tired of that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to switch to organic because the
product was just not the best quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys are willing to take a little
bit of a yield loss at first because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a transition period and all that,
but still those guys will make their two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half pound of light and potentially
three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the thing that there's not a
lot of plants that have been bred under
[SPEAKER_00]: organic production system right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those plants have been done by growers
in small or big breeding systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all been under chemical
nutrients where the microbiome is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more absent from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the research we did in the lab
when I did my master degree were focused
[SPEAKER_00]: around the microbiome that we were living
inside the plant, the endophytic bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that will migrate from one generation,
can be uptaken from the roots and migrate
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way into the seed of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over a generation of time, you can have
an accumulation of endophytic bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: into the seed that will make a plant
better suited for organic production
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that as soon as we're gonna see
breeders starting to develop for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, we're gonna see a whole new
revolution out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most of those strains have
been developed for conventional production
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're an organic grower,
finding seeds that were grown organically
[SPEAKER_01]: may actually contain benefits for
beneficial organisms inside the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we realized that with one
of my colleagues in the lab, I basically
[SPEAKER_00]: got shivers all over because this has
opened so many doors because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: really build a beneficial accumulation of
microorganisms inside the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also everything that happens around
the epigenetics level of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that is, but crossing and
remixing of the gene but more what
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates the gene's expression can be
affected from one generation to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So epigenetics can be a very strong tool
to adapt plant to organic growing systems
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them more responsive to broader
range of interaction with microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of nutrients instead of
just like available ions like they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: selected forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this just brings up an unrelated
question that I've been kind of curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of talk about degradation of
genetic potential in plants with cloning
[SPEAKER_01]: over a series of years or successively
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you seen with your background in
terms of that being a potential problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I've personally
touched that much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been mostly focusing on interrogative
specimen agent nutrients and soil over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like you mentioned, it's
something that we keep hearing like the
[SPEAKER_00]: losing of vigor and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have observed personally,
it's the vigor of a newly selected seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you germinate a lot of seed,
there is definitely a lot of vigor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the organic production system,
we did two pounds of light without CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: when we just started and used terrain from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some increased vigor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems something that people have
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The why and the how, I'm not exactly too
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we've seen that with fungi in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we've observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep feeding the same kind of sugar
to the fungi and you're reproducing it
[SPEAKER_00]: under a petri dish, it's going to become
lazy for other type of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going to bring back from,
let's say, a mild to agar on a petri dish
[SPEAKER_00]: to avoid substrate, sometimes they get
lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost their kind of chemical matrix to
digest it or substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be something like that that we
see in moms kept under a longer term.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard some speculation from a friend of
mine who went online by the name of Spur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he talked about the potential for
genetic degradation when cloning off of
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy mother plants that actually had
the potential to change the genes itself
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen a lot of research on
that one way or another myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely something out there
that can happen to the epigenetic level
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, the plants will over and
under regulate some genes because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a mom that's been growing for 15 years
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those strains have been passed from one
grower to another, one cut from one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some level of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants adapt itself to what they see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know more than that,
but it's something that people have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some old strain that I've seen people
growing, the old original Boba pinkush
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see a lot here in Bayseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are doing very well with it
and other people say, God, plus the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: that cut is too old and people are talking
about backgrossing and doing some stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the vigor back but keeping the same
strain by popping new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something I haven't dabbled too
much with, but it seemed to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get back into your area of
expertise then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I want to touch on is
when you were talking about growers
[SPEAKER_01]: switching over to the style of growing
that you're doing and that you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: push yield quite as far as you would
adding ionic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we didn't talk
about was all of the labor savings and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient savings that you're experiencing
and that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as much as trying to up
production, reducing your expenses and
[SPEAKER_01]: labor is a huge aspect of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
those benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you bring that up because we all
hear about the pound per light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't hear a lot of people talking
about margins and coming from a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all people talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some farmer will take a yield loss and not
plow their field one year because fuel is
[SPEAKER_00]: too cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to reduce their yield,
but overall they're going to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: money because they save on fuel at the
beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this whole aspect where we're
using living soil you don't have to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of nutrient day to day anymore or
way less than mixing everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: pHing, you have to take from five,
sometimes 10 different bottles to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do dub dress once or sometimes twice
during the old road cycle and that's about
[SPEAKER_00]: it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the labor savings are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you have to do after that is to
irrigate your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't push a lot of salt in your
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get less clogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use a lot of those what's
clogging mostly emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's potassium sulfate that reacts with
phosphorus fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have clogging of the line so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's huge saving just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you buy single nutrients,
let's say you buy just your alfalfa meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: just your rock phosphate and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so cheap by the kilo compared to
those other fertilizer and sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer value is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case of veteran blood meal,
we're going to pay two to three dollars a
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo and they're 14 percent phosphorus,
which is still expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural world been in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dirt cheap for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a high value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can afford to put on these
nutrients at optimal levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up a good point, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little about a bottle of
nutrients and what your background and
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts and experience are with that and
how a lot of growers are using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've managed to grow for a fraction
of the cost without using bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of nutrients from starts,
to finish, we're about a couple cents per
[SPEAKER_00]: gram worth of nutrients in our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottle of nutrients, what I've seen
from that, we've seen everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have incomplete nutrients
because people want to carry just one part
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutrient won't be complete because
when you mix calcium and phosphorus at
[SPEAKER_00]: high rates into a bottle, they
precipitate, they go out of solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we have some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go into the agricultural
industry, you never see those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see is like single salt if you're
not organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to buy like potassium,
monopotassium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So zero, 50, 30 and stuff like that that
come in pounds of like in bags of 50
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just dilute that in tank A,
tank B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you're doing is you're
making those every bottle that you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: your shelf that you're buying on shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making giant tanks of that in your
greenhouse and you're paying so much
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper for that because they've not been
premixed for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you're not shipping water around
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of those bottled nutrients,
the primary ingredient is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're diluting them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're only 3%, sometimes 5% of a
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rest of the 10, the 90% must be
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking before we started the
podcast about how you don't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's necessarily in those bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had mentioned you don't like to
use products where you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_01]: in them similar to what you put in your
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to expand on that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just when we know so much about
what goes into our soil, we develop those,
[SPEAKER_00]: this living biology in your soil and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what my nutrient test is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when sometimes you, you see those
nutrients additive and that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily used for their main nutrient,
but they might have an hormonal charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have microorganism and there's
just like they market it as like growth
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer, bud thriving, and you have a
picture of a giant frosty bud on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I don't know exactly what's in
there, I find it hard to put that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we've built and we fully
understand and we know how it reacts to
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or also sometimes there's just not
certified organic and we can't use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just as a general with some growers
are saying, when we do, I do a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of consulting, I have this problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is this type of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an iron deficiency or a boron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to add for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's nothing on their bottle that
says use this for iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes they will have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other nutrients with a little bit
of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to pinpoint problems and
assess in specific situation, those bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Washington, uh, when I got my soil
registered as a fertilizer, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a guaranteed analysis for
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so on the label, it says what a
minimum amount would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a fertilizer company, you don't
have to say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a maximum is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could have, I could have 10%
potassium in there and claim 3% and I'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay as far as the Washington State
Department of Ag is concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, they don't, you don't know
what the iron, manganese, any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, secondary elements are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a grower, it can be,
I think it can be a real challenge unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you get an independent soil test to really
know what you're putting on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes those products are better
off like, uh, having more product in there
[SPEAKER_00]: than less because, you know, so if they
only have like 1% phosphorus when they
[SPEAKER_00]: claim they had five, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they say minimum guarantee
analysis, it's five and you have 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's a problem as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially for other product that I'm
not going to name any brand, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some product that's been recalled off the
shelf because they were not, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just as, uh, they would help for
spider mites, let's say, but it was fully
[SPEAKER_00]: peritrenes that were in the product and
they were being on the shelf for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody knew what there was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just never been checked before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that it was peritrenes
and was an unregistered pesticide used on
[SPEAKER_00]: their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is dangerous for yourself,
your labor and your end user as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a huge problem here in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for a fact that a lot of growers
are using things that they're not supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to use to even, even something they're
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like Eagle 20, Avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're obviously, you guys are,
uh, highly regulated by the Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: government and you're managing to do a
deal with all of these problems without
[SPEAKER_01]: using any chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what do you use for PM and mites
and things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you manage these, these problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IPM program we have the integrated
pest management, it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cornerstone of our production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for spider mites and any insects and
all that we do use beneficial pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a lot of phytosalus personalis
to control spider mites, californicus,
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use swarovski to control for thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a thetac, aryaria and hypoapsis for
controlling fungus nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, we're able to achieve like a
perfect level of control with those
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started to work at Western Medical
at first, uh, they were tense on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, uh, fully spider webs,
a bud and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys were vacuuming the buds every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after, oh yeah, it was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a couple of months and after
meeting you and, uh, Jaya Palmer that
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with you, I'd keep it simple,
like introducing californicus and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other beneficial, just changing what they
were using and increasing the frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: and rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to completely get rid of,
uh, spider mites after one full cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen the little damage here and
there, but I've never sprayed a single
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide in my, uh, in my shop over two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you bring up a good point too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think, I think it's important that
listeners realize that these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: not instant, uh, instant treatment
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does take a little bit of time for
these populations to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do have to apply them at,
at higher levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very sticky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crawling to trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend time cleaning themself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or maybe they even get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but it's a very,
when you work with the plants yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel it on your glove and your skins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine crawling through a forest
of trichomes to try to find food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, trichomes are a natural defense
system by the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I feel, I feel like it
was fairly easy for us to get rid of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was there every day checking on that
and I have a, I have an academic
[SPEAKER_00]: background doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but when I went and introduced that
same identical integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the other shop, we didn't add
always the same success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way you implement that system,
the way you have your workflow through
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility is also very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving from infested to clean area,
so start and work in a clean area at first
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get there during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair nets and changing boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do change clothes from one room to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just put a lab coat on and change our
air net gloves and disinfect your boots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some growers here that were
working in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to do the biocontrol insect
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had really good success in the
vegetative, a little bit tougher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, but we, we were pretty sure
that after one cycle, they would be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, but then on the next cycle things
got worse and we're scratching around,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out what happened and all
that to finally realize that it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboo stick that the grower was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a steak, so you took the bamboo from
harvesting a flower room that were
[SPEAKER_00]: infested with spider mats and put that
into the new veg plants that were going in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we cleaned the room and all
that, the spider mites run away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crawl inside the bamboo stick,
come out when it's in a new room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have super high infestation rate
from spider mites right from the get go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's little details like that,
that if you don't pick on early or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, it's just hard to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so your workflow, all your labor and
people move from one room to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything also super important from your
mother room where you start there starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with clean, product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just double the rates of insect
in my mother room compared to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my facility, which has already kind of
doubled compared to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, just to make sure that we're
starting with clean product all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never would have thought of a steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was such a heartbreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: At our farm, being in a greenhouse and
being out essentially outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it's a very different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can plant a lot of pollinators around
the property, a lot of, a lot of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that attract beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I may see a mite here or there,
but then I'll also see a ladybug and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have the same outbreak
problems that you have to deal with in a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed facility like what you're- Yeah,
unfortunately just pests and insects make
[SPEAKER_00]: it in closed environments all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they will make it in from your staff
or yourself if you're going and working in
[SPEAKER_00]: another production facility or if you have
some guys that have their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: production license at home, they will drag
the spider mites and thrips in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk powdery mildew and fungal
diseases a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your game plan on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaning the room very well between
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little thing that we've started to do
ourselves, I've started to ozone my rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: between cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an overnight, we shut off any
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep the fan recirculating everywhere
and we have an ozone generator in there on
[SPEAKER_00]: a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be very careful with that
because ozone is very toxic to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have any of your stuff
in there, but ozone will disinfect
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on contact because it's so
oxidative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just rips electron from everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go in nicks and micro cracks
and just kill everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a hydrogen peroxide, doing like a
firmigation or a foliar spray of the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the time to clean every
pieces of dust and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of any wood in your growing
room is also a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty hard to disinfect wood and making
sure you have the least surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: possible besides your plant and your
growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any overhead structures, if you have a
lot of wire or anything that can arbor
[SPEAKER_00]: spores, if you can get rid of it,
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to clean room, but that's for
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cleaning your room between cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For prevention on the plants, there's very
few program product that we can use in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Actinovate, which is a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with Actinovate is if you
spray too late on your crops, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a false positive for your
microorganism test, microbial test,
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be careful that you're,
again, starting very early, starting on
[SPEAKER_00]: your mom, rotate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Actinovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Milstup, which is potassium
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change the pH in the leaf
surface, make it harder for the plant to,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the spore to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur vaporizer are also another good
one, but make sure you turn them off for
[SPEAKER_00]: plate flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you're going to give a puff
taste to your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all stuff that we can use,
but also it's to stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also compost tea is a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, be very mindful of your
microbial test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray any of that when you have a
room in flowering or anything past week
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because that's a super highly charged
microbial spray if you use the compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: in foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it will do, it will basically put
probiotics in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have the goal when
you're applying compost tea as a foliar is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just to colonize your leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your microorganism that you're
going to put in there are not going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, actively beneficial for the
plants or actually fight PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a room that's already so
crowded that nobody else can get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to have a big party of
microorganisms, so big that the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew is left on the porch because it's
too crowded out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do when you have a plant
that obviously has a PM and you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, mid flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your protocol then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just hope it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did, we did some hydrogen
peroxide spot spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're usually going to get rid of that
plant, but before we touch or do anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to spray it down with hydrogen
peroxide, which will only kill the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide won't kill the live
mycelium of PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would do, we would bag it up
and just get rid of it and hope for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can take a little bit of PM if it's
not causing too much crop loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress like that, and we're going to do a
super thorough cleanup of our rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so far a finger cross that
haven't happened to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use UV lights in our HVAC system,
so air systems constantly recirculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having UV lights, just household UV
light, they're super cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get one for 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to sterilize the air that
flows around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to consistently decrease
your air borne spore counts in your room
[SPEAKER_00]: of any microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another good preventive thing to
have at all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genetics plays a key role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if ever you're doing a little bit of
breeding, again, at the epigenetics level,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your parent plants have been subjected
to mildew or if you're doing breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: trained to breed for mildew, I would
suggest just infect your plant when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in your breeding tent or whatever
you're using to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just infect your plant with mildew if you
can afford that and just let them breed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds under PM condition, and then those
seeds will be more resistant to PM just
[SPEAKER_00]: from the epigenetics side of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that to another generation,
and you're going to have built-in
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in your plant for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some strains are just so weak for PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you can't even grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get PM no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about humidity, airflow,
and pruning then in terms of helping
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I've seen too often,
unfortunately, it's growers trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate fungal problems by keeping their
room super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see like 40% humidity
level, which stresses the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: can jeopardize your yield and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you prune the bottom of your
plants for yourself, we're doing a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have the good six inches off
the soil cleanup so you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have bigger plants,
the leafing and keeping them not blasting
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fan, but airflow moving through
them, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to get rid of is this dew
point when you have your lights coming on
[SPEAKER_00]: and off, where your temperature is
dropping, you have a lot of moisture in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the air cools down and compacts,
then you have this dew point and high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when you're still your stomata
are still open on your leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very humid in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have this poor PM
Germany thing and making it into a stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: space and infecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This window of infection that you want to
get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some, I think that's the Gavita that
have like sunrise, sunset setting on them
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be a good way to get rid of that
dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ourself, we've been doing that by having a
couple extra lights on a separate timer in
[SPEAKER_00]: our room that would stay for an extra 15
to half an hour on where the main the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the light have been shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also set up your timer to
refresh the air when your lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: shutting off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have more cool air
moving into your room instead of having
[SPEAKER_00]: that warm air cooling down and then just
dumping all that humidity back on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kind of those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I see at our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always see PM whenever we have a big
fluctuation in humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where we have a sunny day followed by a
really rainy day or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll typically see PM over the
following week on all of our squash and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see people running, you know,
you go from a veg cycle where they may be
[SPEAKER_01]: at, I don't know, 60, 65% humidity and
then switching into flour and just
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping that humidity to 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge shock for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to save humidity for Jaya
Palmer when I get him on here because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: got some really interesting thoughts on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya is pretty sharp of that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have yet to try a lot of the cool
stuff he gave me a cross with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to, I want to save that,
that piece, but I'm really excited to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I want to ask you too,
are you reusing your soil or how are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the workflow in terms of plant
size?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that you're doing sea of
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little more about about all
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, well, I want to talk to you
more about soil mixing and nutrients too,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll get to that in a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we just started to reuse our
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we move into rolling beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have tables that roll side to side
in our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we occupy more of our floor space
instead of having five outweigh in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room that allowed us to walk between a row
of pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have just one outweigh that we move
wherever we want it into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have beds of soil that are about
eight inches deep by four and a four and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half foot wide by 50 foot long with a
smart pot custom liner in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all in aluminum trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got really the, all the surfaces of
the soil are exposed to air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get completely aerobic condition in
our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we, it's a lot of work to move
soil into those that we've, we're reusing
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we were not, we were just giving it
away to some local organic grower or soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now we're reusing our soil and we find
that it just gets better the more cycle we
[SPEAKER_00]: do in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first cycle are pretty good,
but the second cycle, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: careful with the tilling, we don't till it
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mix in the first two, three inches
of soil when we're reamending to mix in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, if we have to reamend, that's all
based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mix those nutrients into the first
two, three inches of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leave the rest of the soil undisturbed
not to disturb that mycelium that runs
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the whole soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're replanting our plants,
we're just reconnecting to that mycelium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the internet of our growing beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants just look the second
round and turn around and just take off
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look just so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you bring up something that I talked
about with Steve Solomon already,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have an opinion on, and yours is
going to be a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this whole no-till concept is
really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now with indoor growers and living
soils, my take on it is no till is not
[SPEAKER_01]: totally accurate because we're not tilling
the soil like we would agricultural land,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very, very disturbing to the
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're growing plants a little
larger than you are where the root systems
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting down, you know, six,
eight inches a foot down into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you get the nutrients down into
that area of the rhizosphere quickly in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of a growing cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because traditionally in agriculture,
you know, you could till it in or top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have six, eight months or that off
season for those nutrients to work their
[SPEAKER_01]: way down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, typically you're replanting,
you know, 24, 36 hours later in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you weren't doing a sea of green,
do you think you would have the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you need to till the nutrients in
further or would you still stick to that
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three inch?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had deeper soil, I would go maybe a
little bit deeper and you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to turn into, you don't
want to turn your soil surface into a
[SPEAKER_00]: brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're using sometimes a lot of
different rock dust, glacial rock dust or
[SPEAKER_00]: basalt rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you were using irate of
that in just only two inches of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't look like super nice fluffy
aerated soil anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of a judgmental call of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say I'm using no till.
[SPEAKER_00]: No till I think, like you mentioned,
really coming from the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: system, I think there's beneficial to
break up the soil a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't done the side by side test
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, like if I have to leave a layer
of soil and disturb, I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's potentially good,
but it doesn't mean that I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: disturb my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to disturb my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little less possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to increase microbial activity,
breaking your soil and some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly aerobic bacteria will thrive after
you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how deep are your beds again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's just eight inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're putting the nutrients in the
first few inches and then running a sea of
[SPEAKER_01]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first half of the soil then with
proper irrigation, they're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also another cool thing that you can
do is you can add worms to your beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to move your tub dress up
and down for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I've found if you use worm castings,
they typically have cocoons in there
[SPEAKER_01]: already and eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't even need to necessarily
add worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to just show up in a lot of
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty cool guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I was talking to Steve,
my experience, and he seemed to agree with
[SPEAKER_01]: me, is that cannabis seems to be a pretty
potassium hungry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you finding are the major
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this whole idea of nitrogen in
nitrogen veg, phosphorus in bloom,
[SPEAKER_01]: and apply Cal Mag has been the standard
for the industry forever, but it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: not that accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is, you're going to see it
fairly fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though you have level of
potassium that sound absurd for undercrop,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis just seems to thrive under those
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've found myself was that with
potassium, I think we have pretty similar
[SPEAKER_00]: level of potassium in our soil that you
and I, but what I've seen a lot myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've walked through a lot of program
and I've seen that it's iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictures in magazine with plants that have
iron deficiency, I've seen that by the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering in week two, and I've seen it
in soil testing, we had those like big
[SPEAKER_00]: drop in our program, might not be true for
every growing program, but we were seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: huge drop in iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this like apical like pailing
of the plants when the flower is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to bud a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we've seen a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that as soon as we add a
little bit of iron sulfate or glacial or
[SPEAKER_00]: basalt rock dust, and the plants are
greening up already and you have this big
[SPEAKER_00]: fat stem that develops into a straw that
feeds that bud without pailing that plus
[SPEAKER_00]: of color, the dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So iron was one that I've chased for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done anything with manganese?
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve speculated that manganese would be a
good road to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done a lot of research or work
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we quickly talked about that once
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use manganese sulfate and manganese,
I remember, I think it was the first year
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Kanek and I can't remember the name
of the guy, but he was giving a talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese and importance in HUP and
cannabis cultivation, because that might
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be verified with someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he mentioned that the enzyme
that were synthesizing THC and some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids were using manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more copy of enzymes that were
expressed, the more manganese hungry your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've experienced from level from 20
ppm of manganese all the way to 150 ppm of
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the plant seems to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen too much manganese
toxicity, but I make sure that manganese
[SPEAKER_00]: is there because of those enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the premise I've been working with
and we had pretty good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think those micronutrients are
very important into the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which is the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron, copper, boron, manganese,
and zinc, because they are all our enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: co-factor and all of those enzymes that
are developing your cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: your terpene, your flavonoid, everything
that makes the aroma of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're there and if you have the
proper beneficial life that will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: ciderophores to make a plant available,
then you're really going to increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: your quality of aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to change directions
because you remind me of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had turned me onto a really good
source of insect frass a few months back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I bought like 12,000 pounds or
something of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so excited the first time I see
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't used half of it,
but I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me about some of the benefits
of insect frights besides just the NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial life in there, it's very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it analyzed and those guys are
manufacturing that insect making that
[SPEAKER_00]: insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it analyzed in a microbial charge is
three times more concentrated than worm
[SPEAKER_00]: casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we worked with that stuff
ourselves, we saw a lot of, we found an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, amazing chitinase producer in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bacteria that we haven't
identified yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it got sent out for sequencing and
that's been Frank Gagnebork that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you've talked with that's working with
this biotechnology company in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found this chitinase production
producing bacteria that what if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using shrimp meal, crab meal, or insect
meal or anything, it's going to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: those chitin into oligokytosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oligokytosin can be sent by the plant
and uptake and it's going to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic acquired resistance that a plant
immune system and the plant immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: itself sometime to produce more secondary
metabolite like cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent from an attack from insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very interesting to have that
and made us switch a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: toward those fertilizers that are more
rich in chitin like shrimp and crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the rest of beneficial life
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really good bacillus
cellulose species that we're solarizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just sort of general very good
microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only little thing there was some
bacteria that may help nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilization, but so we just got to be
careful and use it, not just dump
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible load of insect frass on your
plant and it should be all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a pretty good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much are you using approximately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you top dressing with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you mixing it in your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use it as a fertilizer and microbial
inoculant in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in my compost tea mix and in my
top dress as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using a lot of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to export it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I have it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great deal because insect frass
is so expensive here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's for, for whomever is using
stuff like strap and crib meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're reusing your
soil, it's going to make your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more duration you more cycle,
you're going through your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more a single molecule of
chitinase, the more chitinase you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have, the more your chitinase is going
to break down, the more plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: response you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that can lead to something
pretty cool after like three, four cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I need to start, I need to start
experimenting with it, but it's great to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear you give a really good scientific
explanation for all these benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to switch gears for a minute and
talk a little bit more about what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on with cannabis up in Canada and anything
in store for you in the near future or
[SPEAKER_01]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A facility that are being created every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, they're still not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still so far only 42 across the
whole country, but more and more are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting certified and getting inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still only for medical
production, but with licensed producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that the medical producer
will be allowed to sell in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are building
facilities, you know, to position
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves for a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and there is very few technical
expertise right now in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that have learned under
deprivation, not so many people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from academic or horticultural
background so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a need for labor and worker
expertise consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty much, it's a big boom right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current facility, we're going to go 10
times the size that we are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to switch expense to 60,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also experimenting with LED lights
from Fluence by Un-Generang that have some
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very interesting lighting
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm talking to those guys and see if
I can get them on here next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have my first shipment from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got set up as a distributor with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my first shipment arriving
hopefully this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cause awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, have you spoke with Mitch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch is a really great guy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would love an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only talked to Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to send that up the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame though in terms of being on
this podcast because lighting is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know very little about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just pretty much, when Jaya said
that he had talked to you about Fluence
[SPEAKER_01]: and then done the research myself between
the two of you guys, I took that as pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much the best recommendation ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went ahead and placed an order,
but I don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought LEDs were way behind the
times and they were the cost and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything compared to HPI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, or high intensity lights just didn't
seem to add up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we weren't quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the technology is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a big tipping point in the
industry last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still depends on how much you pay
for electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is very cheap in BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like four cents a kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to justify lights that are
using way less, those lights that are
[SPEAKER_00]: using way less electricity, unless they
perform way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Oregon you get 400 bucks cash
discount, I think, if you're buying LED
[SPEAKER_00]: per fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really wish we could have this kind
of program up here because it would make
[SPEAKER_00]: those fixtures way more affordable or the
same price of other fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been to their Photo X conference
last October in Austin, Texas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the amount of expertise coming out of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the first trial with their last
generation of LED that was like a pink
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas light looking LED that the
Spider X provisioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they came out with the white LED
that are fully full spectrum and that are
[SPEAKER_00]: having amazing performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it really appealed to me is when
I heard people doing commercial greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: production using their lights and pulling
their margin with those kind of lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, there's something out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basal production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility of organic basal production
in Virginia, they're using those LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when you see their setup,
it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially for vertical growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ourself, we switched to LED and did
some vertical pre-veggar act in our mother
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a better light quality than
under T5, the internal, the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: stacking better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look more like they've been
growing under full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are darker, thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tighter and turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they're producing so little heat,
you can have your plant growing very close
[SPEAKER_00]: to those LEDs and having a high light
intensity that allowed us to have like way
[SPEAKER_00]: more floor space in our mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took old nursery transportation rack
and then moved them onto vertical growing
[SPEAKER_00]: racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're on wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can wheel them around the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under LEDs and then the plants are
respawning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spawning pretty well to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pricey though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the Instagram of the
Poetry of Plant, Nelson is a great guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've met at that conference and he's
pulling 30% THC, three ounces per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot using those LED from Fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's close to, he's not fully,
fully organic, but he's close to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you brought up a really good
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I want to highlight that what got you
interested in them was the fact that you
[SPEAKER_01]: saw commercial egg, you know, people
growing plants at much, much larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: lower margins than what you're dealing
with successfully using them is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you won't find that basil grower
using advanced nutrients or general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics, you know, those products
can't exist outside the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, agriculture has found better
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, I think that's a really
good point for listeners to take into
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration when evaluating a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go tour your local greenhouse,
go volunteer there for a day or just go
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the product directly from the
greenhouse and have a glance at how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a look at their mixing them,
their injection system and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys are know what they're doing
and they're pulling way smaller margins
[SPEAKER_00]: than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if like they can sell a pound of
pepper for 50 cents, and also if you apply
[SPEAKER_00]: the same principles to cannabis,
you're probably going to do good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the fact that you have this
background in agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing I see lacking in a
lot of times in the facilities that I
[SPEAKER_01]: visit is they hire someone who's been
growing cannabis, you know, for 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: in a basement and haven't experienced
commercial agriculture or know what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like to scale that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be really good with growing,
you know, with one particular line of
[SPEAKER_01]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But stepping outside of that can be a real
challenge if you don't understand what's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going into your soil or into your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in the real challenge is also
like employee management and scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more than just looking after a
few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way more going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you manage, you're managing plant and
people now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants don't shout back at you
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
chat today, David.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful to get to catch up a
little bit through this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, likewise, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's been a pleasure to meet a
fellow like you in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully make you bring good people to
the table and everybody's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: better off for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was David Bernard Perot, lead
agrologist and one of the head growers at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Whistler Medical Marijuana
Corporation.
