[SPEAKER_01]: One last question I had for you that was
sort of unrelated but one that I hear
[SPEAKER_01]: debated by growers that I think you could
answer fairly readily is this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere pH and the importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some organic growers don't really use pH
as a tool because they say that the soil's
[SPEAKER_01]: ability and the microbes ability to buffer
is so great that it's less important.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, some of us like myself feel that
while there is an aspect to that by
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing pH in rhizosphere and in the
soil, we're allowing for the plant to have
[SPEAKER_01]: less stress and to make it easier for the
plant to uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on this and how do
microbes help in that pH and rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, pH is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under high pH, if you really want your
plant to absorb enough iron for the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll to have a good color and
photosynthesis in the leaves, please make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the pH will not be above seven
and a half, even lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, six, eight or something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a low pH, then your plant will
not be able to absorb some of the goodies
[SPEAKER_00]: that is being needed for a good crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something which should be kept
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation is take a nutrient
solution with high buffer capacity and
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help you to overcome those
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it safe to say that the plant
rhizosphere interactions and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere itself is highly complicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still learning a lot about the soil
microbiome in relationship to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having the pH within a range that
is more optimal for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: all we're doing is making it easier for
the plant to access nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will potentially reduce plant
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And allow it to put more energy into yield
and growth and protection, those sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Done.
Thank you.
Yeah.
