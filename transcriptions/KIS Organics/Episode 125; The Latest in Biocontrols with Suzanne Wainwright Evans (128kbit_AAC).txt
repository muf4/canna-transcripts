[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is my good friend,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, also known by
[SPEAKER_01]: many as the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an ornamental entomologist
specializing in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been involved in the green
industry for more than 25 years with a
[SPEAKER_01]: primary focus on biological control and
using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has been on the podcast multiple
times, and I highly suggest folks go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and listen to some of her other podcasts
if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Suzanne, thanks for coming back on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tad, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice to be able to catch up with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been way too long, and I know we've
gotten requests to find out more about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's been going on in the bug world in
relation to cannabis, ornamental crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have to share with us today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess it's partly my fault I have
not been back in a while because last year
[SPEAKER_00]: I was everywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a biocontrol meeting in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: In France, I was at another biocontrol
meeting in England, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: crisscrossing across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was one day last month I was
home like four days last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was home four days out of the month
because I've been traveling so much
[SPEAKER_00]: between conferences and working with
growers on their pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take the blame on not being
around, but I'm glad we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I take back off, I just got back
from the Mant Show in Baltimore last
[SPEAKER_00]: night, and I'm heading down to Florida on
Monday for the TPIE show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along the way, I picked up some really
interesting information, and I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool things that I think would be
good to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the new things I'm super
excited about, and no, this is not a paid
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement, and no, they're not paying
me money, is that ByWorks has this new
[SPEAKER_00]: product called EpiShield, and I'm super
duper excited about it because one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stumbling blocks we have with pesticides
always is re-entry intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you apply a pesticide, you can't go
back in for so many hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: For worker safety, this particular product
does not have a re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you can spray it,
and your workers can go right back in
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to wait because it's
considered very safe for humans to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I'm super excited
about is you can dip cuttings in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've had a lot of challenges
with SufoilX, because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that product, and it does so many
great things, but we do not technically
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dipping label for the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada does have a dipping label,
but we do not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the EpiShield, you are going to be
able to dip in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it is on this 25B EPA
registration exempt list, you can adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: your dipping rates that are appropriate
for your crop so that if you find that
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop may be more sensitive,
you can lower it, or if you want to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a higher efficacy, you might be able
to raise it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a window to work in there,
which BioWorks has done a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity testing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been testing tons of crops to see
if there are any issues, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: lists available of all the crops,
but for the most part, it's looking very
[SPEAKER_00]: safe to dip your products in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main target for it is two-spot spider
mite, and one of the things I'm excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about too is it does kill all live stages
of two-spot spider mite, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: egg, which some of the other botanical
oils do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge advantage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the rates on it are super duper
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10 times lower than some of the
other oil application rates, so that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces the risk of phyto, that keeps your
costs down, and so there's just a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that's looking
very compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of the beneficials in the sense
of, yes, if a predatory mite's sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: a leaf and you douse it in it,
you're going to kill it, but some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial work that's been going on,
actually at growers, one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental grower, that's been releasing
californicus, and they've been using the
[SPEAKER_00]: epishield in junction with the
californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still finding californicus running
around in the crop, even with using
[SPEAKER_00]: epishield to kill the spider mites,
and so we think it has to do with how
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites deposit their eggs on the
undersides of the leaves and the domitia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very difficult to get spray
coverage there, so they're kind of out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way of the spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really excited again, especially
with the no REI and the dipping on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this product's going to be really
good for BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I recently did a post on why I am
using SufoilX in my garden, and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of pushback from some folks
regarding the fact that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: petroleum-based product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and I talk about how we use
Vaseline, and there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we should probably be more
concerned about in our lives than a
[SPEAKER_01]: petroleum-based or mineral-oil-based
product, but the epishield, Dr. Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownbridge just said me an email not that
long ago about it, and the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: stood out to me were it's a 25B product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was clove oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go back and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the main ingredient, but the
coverage on it looked like the particle
[SPEAKER_01]: size was smaller, so the coverage looked
better, and so like you said, there's less
[SPEAKER_01]: residual on the leaf surface, and normally
with 25B products, I tend to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: skeptical, mostly because coming from you,
I realized that there tends to be less
[SPEAKER_01]: research on efficacy around them,
but BioWorks has such a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation in this industry for the level
of research and data that they bring to
[SPEAKER_01]: the table, and yeah, I'm just really
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot more confidence in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple samples in the mail right
now on their way to the farm, and I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: wait to start playing around with it and
using it, because personally, I would feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better using a clove oil-based product if
the efficacy is there over even SufoilX or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, and the dip ratio is
a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know, so that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's a combination of
peppermint, clove, and a surfactant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and the entomologist that developed
it tried lots of different ... It's
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that sweet spot of killing insects
without damaging plants, and he worked
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard on developing this, and as you
said, BioWorks, they will not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, here's a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran trials on this for an extensive
amount of time to make sure they have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, all the research, and that it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just a we'll bring anything to
market kind of company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very particular about what they do
sell, and with their team of experts like
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Michael Brownbridge and Julie Gresh
and Dr. Chris Hayes, they've really got an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing line of people there, because it's
their reputation, and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring a bad product to market,
and I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so always skeptical about essential
oil products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them salad dressings, and this one
has actually changed my mind a bit more on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these products, because of just
mainly the efficacy, and they've done work
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis aphid, and it's for target
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two Spot SpiderMite is what initially was
the main focus, but they definitely have
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy on aphids, and they've done some
work on cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done work on white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does provide some efficacy on thrips,
but it's not like the home run on thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: like it is with Two Spot SpiderMites,
so more work will be coming, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different rates, looking at different
species of thrips, different aphids and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, so there will be a lot more
information coming, and also the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: clean dental mint kind of thing,
so it's not an overwhelming smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sometimes can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a super light
wintergreen, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to explain the aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could this, in theory, for growers
potentially be something they could use
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable to Suf Oil X, in terms of the
efficacy of it, and use for use rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: On SpiderMites, I'm believing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids, probably not sure about thrips
yet, because again, it's not quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: strong as a thrips product, but again,
you have to look at your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at all the differences between
the two, and decide which one's best for
[SPEAKER_00]: your application and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do something with Michael talking
about it here soon anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on my list of potential upcoming
podcast topics, so I'm glad we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm excited, because again,
it's in the hands of a bunch of my growers
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and getting feedback from them,
so that's super exciting on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll move on from EpiShield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, which may not be as
exciting for everybody, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think is super exciting,
is BioBee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think of them as not one of the
big boy insectaries, but now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely inking them more into this big
boy category, because of their product
[SPEAKER_00]: line, and the team they put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are now actually selling a
blower, which I'm super excited about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because for a lot of people, we have to
apply over large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were having to hand sprinkle out
predatory mites, or you had to build your
[SPEAKER_00]: own blower, you had to buy a blower,
get PVC pipe, attach a funnel on it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: ball valve, and try to work all this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But BioBee now actually has for sale a
blower that they've essentially calibrated
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, it's adjustable, and so people
don't want to build this, and they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to blow out things like predatory
mites, lace-winged larvae, and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that over larger areas, which not
necessarily something you're gonna do for
[SPEAKER_00]: well-spaced out cannabis plants,
but for propagation, or for people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to actually have a
blower for sale now, and it's working
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten feedback from my growers,
and they've all been pretty happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they have application charts
showing which beneficial you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to dial in the adjustments on it,
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm pretty excited about that,
to have a new piece of equipment for
[SPEAKER_00]: application, because application for a lot
of my growers, the application of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials is the limiting factor because
of the cost of application of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because applying, beneficials can be very
labor intensive, especially when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to teach treat 10, 20, 30 acres,
and having these automated things are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty exciting, which includes,
and again, it doesn't affect your people
[SPEAKER_00]: as much, but BioBessa Europe now has a
piece of equipment called the Intomatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can attach to the back of tractors
to go out and do large farm fields to ply
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites at an incredibly fast
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go down the middle,
and they've got these long booms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the airflow carries the predatory
mites, and they're applied at like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna allow for larger acre
applications of beneficials that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drone technology's been coming
along, ParaBug's been doing an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with applying beneficials,
but not everybody can use drones for
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, because if you're near the
airport, or if you don't have a licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: person near you, or if you don't wanna get
a drone license, this is gonna be an
[SPEAKER_00]: option for large scale application,
the Intomatic, if you can't use drone
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, not everybody can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen any of the
videos online or anything of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the drones actually at trade
shows at BioControl's conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: or BioSolutions conference, in what they
call themselves now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, I just wanna add,
we've been working exclusively with BioB
[SPEAKER_01]: now for a couple years, offering their
beneficial insects shipped direct from
[SPEAKER_01]: Insectory, and they've been wonderful to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love the quality of the insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They arrive in great shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a friendly reminder to folks,
whatever your bug provider is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it can be Kiss Organics,
but if it's not, make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them directly from the Insectory
shipped to you, so that they're not being
[SPEAKER_01]: repacked, just to maintain viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying what Suzanne has said over
multiple podcasts over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, I wanna also mention,
because you mentioned cool tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's been around for a little
while now, that I know you're a fan of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently applied SF nematodes in my tiny
garden at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a tool, but for a facility,
the nematode bucket, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I've seen that, and it's
something that you really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you wanna touch on that,
since you mentioned a grower tool for
[SPEAKER_01]: applying beneficials that is kind of
unique and interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funny is, I call it the
nematode bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by a dram, and I honestly don't
know the real name, which is terrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've demonstrated it at workshops,
and I was just talking at The Mant Show
[SPEAKER_00]: this week with Kurt Becker, and we were
talking about the nematode bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the back of my mind, I was saying,
you guys need to put a vinyl nematode on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bucket, like a cutout, to make people
think about that, but then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my gosh, that sounds like such a girly
thing to do, so I didn't tell it to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it'd be a great branding
thing just to call it the nematode bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's mostly what people use it
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for fertilizers also,
and bio pesticides and stuff, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality is, is most people that are using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds simple, but let me tell you,
it is not simple necessarily to engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bucket that has a motor in the base
that not only aerates, but circulates
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes in a vortex and it keeps the
water oxygenated so that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying nematodes, they don't drown and
they don't settle out, because nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: will settle out pretty fast in water,
and I have had some growers try to build
[SPEAKER_00]: their own systems, and the problems they
ran into is sometimes the motors heat up
[SPEAKER_00]: too much, the compressed air gets too hot,
and they end up cooking the nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what can happen is if you get like a
dead spot in your bucket or container,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nematodes can get caught up in those
corners and you don't get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes out at an even application,
and they worked on it a couple years to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the design right for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, I think that's a great tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little expensive, but if you are
putting out your nematodes more evenly,
[SPEAKER_00]: more alive and more viable, it's gonna pay
for itself, because ironically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one of the first nematode,
I mean, first cannabis meetings I went to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody talking about using
beneficial nematodes for fungus net
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, awesome, and they were
talking about, well, but we struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get even distribution,
and we're using a ladle to ladle them out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why aren't you using an injector
with an aeration bucket, and they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know what I was talking about,
and this is why I think it's so important
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis growers to come to
traditional horticultural conferences and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade shows, because sometimes the
problems you have, another industry has
[SPEAKER_00]: already solved it, and you can pick up on
those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this bucket that DRAM designed
was designed for the floriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, but now I see more cannabis
growers using it too, so it can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: cross over the markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I was talking to Kurt,
do you have any questions about the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna touch, well, no, I wanna talk
about SF nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the smallest amount I could
order was quite large, and that was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just, my goal with my
application, I mixed it in a five-gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, I was over-applying it,
because I only had a couple yards of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and two four-by-four beds, so it wasn't a
big deal for me to over-apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the home grower, could you just go
over a quick version of why SF nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: are so wonderful?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you receive them, apply them,
for someone who's not gonna get the
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode bucket, I just think that would
be a good review to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just so you know, on the tray
nematode products, the reason why it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't come in small, small packages is
because the viability goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have a certain mass to
maintain temperature and the right
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and everything, and when BASF was
testing, they basically can't go much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller without affecting a viability,
so that's part of the issue there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for storage, where you can put them in
your fridge and have them for several
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find suppliers that will sell them
on very small amounts on sponges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those sponges you can take and
literally wring out in a watering can and
[SPEAKER_00]: walk around, and if you're doing house
plants, water them that way, or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up in a five-gallon bucket,
but the challenge is, is you gotta get
[SPEAKER_00]: them all stirred in and you gotta move
real quick, so that they don't settle
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that constant agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one way I see people killing
nematodes is they take nematodes out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the refrigerator and put them in too warm
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna make sure your nematode
temperature and your water temperature are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not exactly close, but you know,
be within 10, 15 degrees-ish kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, because they're kinda like fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you bought your fish in the
bag, you brought them home, you don't dump
[SPEAKER_00]: them into your tank, you let it float so
the water gets pretty close together in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish bag and your tank water so that
you don't shock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually take your nematodes
out of the fridge an hour or so before
[SPEAKER_00]: applying them and let them kind of warm up
to room temperature, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: your tap water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, my kitchen tap water is
crazy cold because of it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime, but I'll be in Florida next
week, and there's no such thing as cold
[SPEAKER_00]: tap water in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's warm to hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes out of your tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to look at your water
temperature, how you're storing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which should be around 40, 41 degrees,
and then try to either get your nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: warmed up, get your water cooled down,
let your water warm up, and kinda get them
[SPEAKER_00]: closer together for application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing is you wanna make sure
they don't settle out so that you do get
[SPEAKER_00]: an even application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're doing like what you did or
what I do at home, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this giant package of nematodes
and you need to treat a small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: you're over-applying them anyhow,
so it's not as much of a deal to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're so evenly distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you've gotta go treat large
acreage, you've gotta make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is getting their nematodes out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very compatible with most
insecticides products, even the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually tank mix them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial nematodes are actually,
once you get them in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pretty hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're easy to kill in the package
and when applying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are all the targets of the SF
nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, our industry is using
floriculture, cannabis, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using them for fungus snap
management and they are also using them
[SPEAKER_00]: for control of certain thrips species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all thrips species, but thrips that
pupate in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely get some onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be aware, there are other beneficial
nematodes, Carpacapse, Bacteria 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will also actually infect fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will infect thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the initial research has shown that
the Feltier works better for the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats and western flower thrips,
where Bacteria 4 and Carpacapse we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: other more agricultural pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tend to see western flower as the
dominant thrip species in cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: onion?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion is the predominant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see a kinothrips less, to a less
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I very rarely, rarely, and personally,
I've still never seen western flower
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say it can't exist, but I have not
seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've seen, all the samples I've
looked at have been onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about onion
thrips life cycle while we're at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more for my own edification again,
because I guess I have thrips,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I spotted them on my young plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't found any real damage,
but I'm not going to say they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what I did first,
and then you can tell me about the life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle to tell me if I addressed it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be a good way to approach this
really quick before we go on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: latest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a grower called me, said, hey,
the clones you gave you, I found some
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot, but you probably have thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I went back through my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, I found a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hard to spot, but I did not get
them identified by you, other than I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already probably shaking your head.
What?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a couple of applications of
Sufoil X.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the form of Monterey horticultural
oil, because I can pick that up locally or
[SPEAKER_01]: on Amazon in a small enough size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a five gallon bucket of
Sufoil or a gallon of Sufoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did two applications of that,
two to three days apart, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I followed that up with a release
of SF nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's where I got to go back and
remember my list of beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I always forget this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stratulae lapse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Cucumeris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it on the foliage or in the soil?
Swirski.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swirski on the foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a foliar of Swirski.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were my, along with the
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I might have also released
some rove beetles at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was sort of my preventative
approach towards dealing with this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen any insects in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I had some fungus gnats at the
time, too, and I haven't I haven't had any
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats showing up on my sensor
cards, my yellow sticky cards since the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's been a month or so now,
a month, a month and a half, at least
[SPEAKER_01]: since I did all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how would you have approached it,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have identified what thrips it
was, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was this was this outside or is this
like indoors, indoors, indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because and I think most of the
growers we work with are indoors that
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just take this from an indoor
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, some people, you know,
will grow a few plants and pots in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've gotten them outside, too,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside is probably a different species,
especially when you go down to California
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a completely different species
in cannabis outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what you were dealing with,
I'm going to guess without seeing it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology is very similar to Western flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult flies in female.
[SPEAKER_00]: She inserts her egg into the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hatches out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cruising around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have asymmetrical mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of more and I use the word
brass, but they kind of like damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell surface there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you get that white
silverish kind of color to them because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're removing the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look there through when they're
in their early and stars, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: toddlers and even teenagers, they're
they're kind of yellowish clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see the green chlorophyll from
the plant in their in their gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they poop it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of greenish color from the
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to cruise around and
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of and it you know,
I always hate to say things because people
[SPEAKER_00]: take it like, oh, my God, that's it's
black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, onion thrips tend to feed
more on foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they can feed on foliage,
but generally they are more of a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: problem because they really like pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Western flower thrips are what we
see a lot in pansies and we see them in
[SPEAKER_00]: petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see, you know, in lilies because
they have a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion thrips tend to be more foliage
feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're growing cannabis,
guess what you don't have present?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I think people because they they
don't do their due diligence and take the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to ID, which I don't expect growers
to be able to sell species of thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extensions jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people that that can do that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people guess and they do the matching
photos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot just match photos of
Western flower thrips and onion thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ID from a distance, you have to look
at the length of the hair on the
[SPEAKER_00]: protenotums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to count in tenal segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but but the good thing is
generally for onion thrips in Western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips, the management is basically
the same because the biology is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're they're young.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eating on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they drop to the soil to pupate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the adults emerge back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it gets sticky is when you're
dealing things with like a kind of thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: who do not drop to the soil to pupate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a much larger thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predatory mites can't take out a kind
of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you generally have to spray for a kind
of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to onion and Western
flower, the bios work really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the predatory mites and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets into chemicals, Western
flower thrips have more resistance issues
[SPEAKER_00]: than onion thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not something cannabis people
necessarily have to worry about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those kinds of pesticides you're
not going to be using anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about the SF nematodes
Swirsky approach following up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a couple of days after a couple
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suffolk applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray your suffolk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolk is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When suffolk is dry, you can release a
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to do like,
you know, two or three sprays of suffolk,
[SPEAKER_00]: like two to three days apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's smart to wait to release the
predatory mite from an x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from an economic standpoint,
I generally go with Cucumeris more because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot less expensive and it works
just as well in cannabis on the thrips as
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky tends to be, you know,
a little more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but no, I think that's that's a
perfectly fine program and using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your sticky cards, you know,
to monitor, I think is a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good, good tool for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you I'll give you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing you mentioned was how they
eat the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the ways I just scouting for
thrips, when you see that, like I always
[SPEAKER_01]: called it like the shiny leaf surface is
how I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just has a different gloss to the
leaf where the damage is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that unique to thrips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, thrips damage looks very
specific compared to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I look for is that
shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, lace bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lace bugs can give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of look too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lace bugs aren't a big problem in
cannabis, but it has lace bugs have been
[SPEAKER_00]: reported in cannabis, but it's not a huge
economic issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard to ever say always,
but generally also, you know, spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: damage sometimes can look a little
similar, but they don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: silveriness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't always see that silveriness
with thrips damage, but you do see it
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I totally interrupted you as you
were going through some of the latest and
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest stuff on a tangent on thrips,
but I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did you want to share in the
last year that you've been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I was going to say,
because we were talking about the dram
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket, Kurt Becker, I had a conversation,
Kurt Becker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the Cultivate show this July in
Columbus, Ohio, amazing show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The education, everything and someday Tad,
we're going to get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm teaching a full day workshop on the
Saturday before the show starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we're doing talking
about equipment is I'm going to have dram
[SPEAKER_00]: come talk about their foggers because more
and more people are looking at pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: foggers, cold foggers and things like that
so that they can apply for for ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, conventional pesticides,
but also microbials, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Bavaria, things like cordyceps,
things like metarysium where you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in there, close the door, have the
timer kick on and basically air quote fog
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility with these microbial
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about REIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about,
you know, you doing the spray coverage and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dram is going to come and talk about
and show the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to show about how they do
the efficacy testing for microbials going
[SPEAKER_00]: through these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a really,
that's just going to be a part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of stuff we're going
to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about some other
other products I'm about to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be demonstrating how to use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to be doing some more
how to basically kind of take cuttings off
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants, washing plant cuttings and how
to find pests in them for early detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a bunch of good
stuff at Cultivate this July.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one dumb question then before you
move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as someone who is like very conscious
of my health, probably I have too much
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety around it in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I think about with REIs when I
go to visit facilities and some facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: are great about it and some are not,
as I'm sure you've seen in terms of PPE or
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, let me show you this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know when they last sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little nervous about that,
but if, if you were to use like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's just say as a hypothetical,
you were to use a fogger to spray a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to be breathing that
in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, you know, with no REI, does that
just, does that just settle so rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can go back into a room
relatively soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have an REI, but what happens is,
is they set these to go off when nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will fog and then why your REI is
why nobody is at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just say they're not doing it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm sure that is the case in more
facilities than you realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's assume that they let off a,
you know, they, they set off the fogger in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take for those particles
to settle back down to where you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing the products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Particle size and how much venting you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there are all these venting rules
that go along too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very variable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just going through there one
time, probably not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work there probably over time,
never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not worried that like the
microbes are going to like the bacteria is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start growing in my lungs
necessarily thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know we breathe these things all
the time in much, much lower
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations, but I feel like just
getting anything in your lungs isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it just concerns me sometimes
when I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow quite as well that I'm visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's why you should also carry
gloves with you because you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's been sprayed on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, by law, they have to label,
you know, what was in sprayed and the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in theory, that's what they should be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that people to go in now, here's the
crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The REI applies to their employees,
not you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no legal REI for someone
randomly walking into a room is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying versus an employee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's interesting, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scary, but interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a general rule for people who are
listening to the podcast, just make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're following all the instructions on
whatever product you're applying and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, just be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it's something I, I just read about,
uh, I just heard a thing about a new
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmed death actually in cannabis,
um, relating to a girl who was working in
[SPEAKER_01]: a canvas facility and developed
essentially anaphylaxis from, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the terpenes in the cannabis,
uh, an allergist posted about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a confirmed document in case
where she developed an allergic reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in being working in areas that were
poorly ventilated, she eventually,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I went into anaphylactic shock and
passed away sadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes when I go in these rooms,
I do, it is almost overwhelming the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the smell and I'm allergic to
everything myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's something I'm just really
sensitive to, but we're getting off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and, and as Wendy Kornberg will tell
you that she, she tells me I'm allergic to
[SPEAKER_00]: butterfly farts because I am so sensitive
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some of the cannabis facilities,
it's, it's quite overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, it's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you ever go into a field of
like five acres of gardenias and full
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom, it's almost hard to breathe because
it's just those plant volatiles can be so
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're smelling them, you know,
it's, it's coming off the plant and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going into your lungs and it can be kind
of sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, you just have to be smart about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and don't be afraid to say
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I was at a, um, uh,
floor culture facility one time many years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and they wanted us to go through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked across the greenhouse and
they were spraying pesticides while we
[SPEAKER_00]: were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this poor little bee flew past me
and literally fell on the ground and died
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, we need to leave right now
because we should not be in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think sometimes growers,
cause they're so used to being around it
[SPEAKER_00]: to get desensitized to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you don't know anybody
that's had pesticide poisoning or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you don't think about it as
much, but your health is not worth not
[SPEAKER_00]: saying something error on the side of
caution always, um, because you only get
[SPEAKER_00]: one body and you need, you know,
you need to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the label is the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must follow those labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't think the EPA will catch
you, catch up with you eventually your
[SPEAKER_00]: state regulators, if you're doing
something illegal, they will eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the note of the label, one thing
that you've taught me is it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: important to spray at the label rates,
because if you under spray, the pest may
[SPEAKER_01]: survive and develop a resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you may be creating a further
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always important to fall, to spray at
full strength or whatever the label says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people think I'm going to be
environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to use as much, but it just
sets you up for failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why products have labeled
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the research has been done to
show that is like where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the most efficacy, but still safe for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's, that's why it takes
so long to bring products to market these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you have to have so much scientific
information to back all this up,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, out there.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a wonderful tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else did you want to talk about,
um, in the past year that you've,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you've been excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have these here, uh, catch masters
has come out with a new sticky card shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can get it out of the box,
um, they are doing, and I'm super excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about these, especially for, uh,
smaller gardeners, um, smaller production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to have these for my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yes, Suzanne gets fungus gnats too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are pre-cut cause I had so many
growers cutting sticky cards to make small
[SPEAKER_00]: ones for monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you don't need a full size sticky
card and it's got a pointy tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stick it right in the soil,
peel it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write on these, the information
and away you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm they, um.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never told me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will reach out to Alex about that here
after the call.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, cause we do sell catch master
sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those, these are the shape of a,
a plant marker or a pot stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what you, you know them as,
but that's what she's holding up right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that are listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I was going to add one side has
adhesive on it so that you can peel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like one side is sticky and
then the other side you can write on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is exciting for
propagation, um, for homeowners,
[SPEAKER_00]: for interior scapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, I'm real excited about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, I'm actually, they're going to be
at the show in Florida next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll be talking about these down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm excited about these because again,
so many of my, even large growers were
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the cards and then you're nobody
wants to sit and cut sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your scissors get all gross with the
goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that's something I'm excited
about too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things I want to add to that about
sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one, what you should be writing on the
back is the date so you can keep track of
[SPEAKER_01]: how long that card's been in there or that
pot stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then two, one thing I found with
the catchmester cards is the whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: adhesive that they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've, I've actually talked to their,
uh, head guys about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to do a little, not a podcast,
but maybe a shorter little snippet with
[SPEAKER_01]: them to put up on, uh, social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, the glue on it is, is it's not as
sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier for me to get their
sticky card glue off of my hands when I
[SPEAKER_01]: touch it, or it doesn't necessarily come
off on my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to what I remember from a sticky
card, like 15, 20 years ago, where like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you so much, it looked at that thing,
like your hands were going to be gross for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different kinds of sticky
cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called dry sticky cards and
they're designed for catching things like
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips and, um, whiteflies, smaller
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have seen sold at a lot of the grow
stores and the cannabis industry have been
[SPEAKER_00]: using are there for catching larger
insects and they have a heavier glue to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the thickness of the glue depends
on the size of insect you need to trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw, um, you guys don't have it on
the West coast, but emerald ash borer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is torn through the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they put these giant purple traps,
but it has a really thick glue on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause those beetles are like three
quarters of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a lot of glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get different levels of glue
depending on what you're targeting and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea with these is if you put your
hand on and peel off, you really don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands stuck to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say if you have a sticky card on
your desk and you lean down and put your
[SPEAKER_00]: head on it, it will stick to your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done that a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but these are designed for trapping
small insects, not big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you do ever get the sticky on your
hand, just vegetable oil would take it
[SPEAKER_00]: right off your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know about the glue thing,
but that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been using the catchmester cards
now in my garden and like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a little tacky when you end up
touching it, but it doesn't stay on your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like I have to go wash my
hands immediately or like my hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: my skin stuck together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got sold on their cards when I,
I wanted to do like a photo shoot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people putting out cards and I used
catchmester cards and the grower hung it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and we were standing there talking and
I literally was watching thrips fly into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and don't get caught up in this idea
that you need to have blue cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'll read that online, um,
a friend of mine, Sarah Jen Drissick in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has done some research showing
yellow works just as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not better for trapping thrips,
the, the yellow over the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't spend the extra money on the
blue, the yellow work perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So should we be using blue cards at all in
your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if people are releasing high
levels of parasitoids, they may move to
[SPEAKER_00]: blue because the parasitoids seem to go to
the yellow more than the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but generally people are putting out high
levels of parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take their sticky cards down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that for, for what you're doing in
cannabis, generally I would, I would think
[SPEAKER_00]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but I don't want to say never,
don't I want to say never, but generally
[SPEAKER_00]: known for the most part, you don't need
them unless there's a special
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about the mass trapping,
uh, roles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you're having massive white fly
issues, if you're having massive thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially fly in thrips, this is,
we do this more with vented greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses that open their sidewalls and
we have massive influx from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these massive sticky rolls to do
mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have never in indoor, indoor
cannabis seen thrips numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the roof that you would need
the mass trapping roles necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not going to hurt to have
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I have seen is because,
you know, cannabis growers love releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybird beetles and I've seen numerous
times they have those massive yellow rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dump out the ladybugs and then
ladybugs just all get stuck on those big
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a friendly reminder to folks,
we're not buying ladybugs because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: wild harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can bring in diseases and there's
just much better options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though they do look cool and they seem to
have become the face of biocontrols that
[SPEAKER_01]: they really shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, my friend, Kim Horton,
who you've met, um, she was out hiking in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and she came across a huge mass
of overwintering ladybird beetles and she
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on my bucket list is to see the
overwintering sites in California for
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have millions of these ladybird
beetles all clustering together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you paint the scene here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't even know what that would
look like other than I know that they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how they're harvested, but is it
literally like a giant?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, they cover the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cover the trunks of the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll, you know, get into
crevices and rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the East coast, a bunch of our
ladybirds here overwinter under and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, these are more vertical
overwintering sites in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share the pictures with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, getting back to the mass trapping
thing, I just want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times what I see is people are
mass trapping for fungus nets,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really maybe that money would be much
better spent then on like SF nematodes as
[SPEAKER_01]: an approach or BTI or something else
rather than trying to catch the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been some other mass
trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you remember fungus nets,
you're only going to be low down near the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got your sticky ribbon way
up high, you're not going to get many up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up high is you're getting more of the
flying in white flies, flying in trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to do what I would say
mass trapping for fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the traditional square sticky
cards down on the soil surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a billboard because you want it low
where the fungus gnats are hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: not way up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you run a strip along the edge of
the facility though, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: lower down closer to the soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did the sticky guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lacewings, love lacewings in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lacewing larva we know will feed
on aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll snack on spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll definitely feed on some,
some percentage of thrips or not what you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to for thrips, but they're a good,
generous predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem we've had is application
because you generally buy eggs or you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get them out on the plants
where you can buy those lacewing egg cards
[SPEAKER_00]: that you rip and tear and hang,
which I do love for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your plants are well spaced,
trying to rip all those and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: around sometimes can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new product called egg Javent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is selling it if you buy the eggs
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you read the label, it's xanthan
gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what you can do is you can
use a pump up sprayer or a backpack
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the filters out, you put water
in, you put your xanthan gum, egg Javent
[SPEAKER_00]: in, and then you add the lacewing eggs,
stir, well, you stir up the xanthan gum
[SPEAKER_00]: first, get that dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put the lacewing eggs in and you
literally can spray it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lacewing eggs will stick to the
plant leaves and then they'll hatch in
[SPEAKER_00]: about two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can go walking off across
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray out a lot of lacewing
eggs, getting really good coverage on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the crop pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty economical way to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did tests in the fall on poinsettias to
see if it left any kind of residue or
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And xanthan gum is something we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't just eat straight xanthan
gum, but it's a gumming agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you're spraying a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spraying a food grade something on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you brought up lacewings,
can you touch on what instances you might
[SPEAKER_01]: use them in cannabis and what their target
pests are?
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, just generally any soft bodied
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely feed on two spot spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will definitely feed on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some work that's been done
looking at them for a kind of thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will definitely snack on thrips
if they find them on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think they're a good, cheap
insurance policy to put into a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops because they'll feed on just about
anything if they find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're inexpensive to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of supply of lacewings
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that they have
shortages of and it's hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this something you would sort of
tack on if you were already ordering
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of an added tacker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every program depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had well spaced cannabis plants
where there's not bridging between the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage, where you could put lacewing
larva on one plant and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move to the other plants through the
canopy of the plant, if you have them
[SPEAKER_00]: spaced, and if you have a lot of area to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, if you've got 5,000 plants,
you're not going to be able to go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang egg cards on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way you can mix them up and just
go out and spray them over top and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something for small
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's going to get you
a lot of lacewings eggs out fast and an
[SPEAKER_00]: economical way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess a better way to phrase my
question is for since the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: people listening probably aren't,
you know, super large scale growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: when and how would they want to use
lacewings if?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for them, if you're a smaller scale
home hobby, you know, I would go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: egg cards and then just try to have your
plants touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg cards are little strips of
cardboard with a hanger on them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have lacewing eggs glued on there that you
just walk along and you can hang on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when those eggs hatch,
they walk off the card and then they go up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the canopy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have a concentration
of lacewings wherever you put those egg
[SPEAKER_00]: cards, which may be OK, because if if you
really want a concentration in a place,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could do those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use those a lot on tropical foliage
when we have outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're larger and again need to get
lacewing eggs all over the place,
[SPEAKER_00]: the egg event might work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can mix those eggs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an hour and a half to get them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lacewing eggs can survive underwater
for 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you keep your pressure
below like 40 psi, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, take out your your filters
because you don't want to try to cram
[SPEAKER_00]: lacewing eggs through filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just I'm really excited
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For for application methods, I'm
interested to see outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is this something we can use?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are concerned a bit about
rain because if you put them on,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it heavy rains, it's going to wash them
right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for outdoor or overhead, able overhead
irrigation, you're going to have to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about your timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there are clear answers
yet of when you spray them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it mists, will they come off?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how much rain does it take to
wash wash them off?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for indoor production drip
irrigation, you know, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings up another question I saw,
and this is a little unrelated,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the lacewings got me thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw a post recently where someone was
sort of against beneficial insects because
[SPEAKER_01]: they feel like they just end up in the
buds, the final product with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, how would you address that and
what beneficial insects are less are
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory insects, I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are less likely to end up getting
stuck in the trichomes relative to other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to insects, beneficials
and flowers, it can be kind of a touchy
[SPEAKER_00]: thing because there's certain insects
definitely like I I've definitely over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years changed my tune on rove beetles,
the atheta in cannabis because I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: too many cannabis growers contacting me
asking how to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they do get in the bud and flower,
especially if they're not happy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to disperse or you have too much
food for them and their population
[SPEAKER_00]: explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can fly and get up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally don't recommend it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even using them in like vegetative,
because if you put them in vegetative,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still going to be there in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one example of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one, ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a million pictures of ladybugs
stuck in cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as long as you stick to things
that are smaller, predatory mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, generally they like to go to the
undersides of leaves because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for their food sources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to be careful, though,
with using insects because it's not only
[SPEAKER_00]: can they get stuck in the bud,
they can get stuck in the trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a variety that's very
trichomy and super sticky, your
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials may not even work,
especially for things like lacewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a few weeks into flower,
you generally don't even want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: lacewing larva because they can get stuck
in those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But predatory mites, because they are so
small, they can navigate their way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know if his issue
is like he feel like he's going to fail or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it, you know, the the gross factor of
like, oh, I may consume an insect because
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know we all eat insects all day
long and all our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another protein source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But considering the alternatives,
you don't have many other alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is why you need to start your
management programs in propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: continue them heavy through vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you shouldn't have to treat heavy in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally people wait till they have a
problem and then it's too hard to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start your bios in propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the issue was insect parts,
insects and insect frass, their poop
[SPEAKER_01]: ending up on the buds themselves that you
end up smoking or having to pick out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your finished buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mites like don't have little poops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a liquid and you're not
picking those out ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you get caterpillars,
those will leave giant honking poops in in
[SPEAKER_00]: in your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, there are some caterpillars
have giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, grasshoppers have giant big solid
poops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these insects more they don't
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be very delicate around
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have solid bowel movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have liquid because they're more
feeding on plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what they're eating,
because caterpillars consume all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, caterpillars, grasshoppers consume
all the fiber mites and thrips are more
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking the contents of plant tissue out
and not actually eating the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not going to be poops to pick
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, that was just one of the
complaints with beneficial insects that I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought would be interesting to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be there's always
going to be people that have complaints
[SPEAKER_00]: about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the scale of issues I deal with
every day, poops from beneficial insect
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the plants is not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's probably more it's probably
more the bodies, to be fair, to accurately
[SPEAKER_01]: portray the argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I mean, no one wants to be
picking, you know, fungus gnats out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their out of their buds and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, there's not a lot of
great options in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to be spraying anything
that's going to be leaving a residue on
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes anywhere, damaging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beneficial insects are really about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, you know, you see photos online of
people with like webbing from two spot
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites, you know, three quarters of
the way through flower and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or you get that phone call and
it's like, there's really not much you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do at that point safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you punch yourself in the face for
screwing up, get in your time machine and
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and do your preventative program
when you don't think you have a problem to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that from happening, because that
literally does not happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been building and building and
building and you weren't being
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative in your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot wait till you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on, was there anything else that
you wanted to talk about regarding sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I guess this has kind of turned into
like sort of a new product podcast of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you found that are exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any new research that's come out
in the last year in relation to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that you might want to share, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: On actual cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just don't even have to comment on
this, but I so when I was at the meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: in France, I was at the International
Organization of Biocontrol Conference in
[SPEAKER_00]: Brest, France, late fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a very intense meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started at like eight thirty in the
morning and went to about six every day
[SPEAKER_00]: with presentations on basic kind of what's
going on around the world with biocontrol,
[SPEAKER_00]: what research is happening, who's doing
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, cannabis came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talked to the European people,
about the issues with aspergillus in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you know, this is a
thing in the States where they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this testing and they're like,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them had never even heard of
this phenomenon of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crazy thing is, is so aspergillus,
the genus, there were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: presentations on using different species
of aspergillus as biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, because in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada, there is such a negative
connotation with the word aspergillus that
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you came to market with
aspergillus, that was the best biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial ever because the name
aspergillus is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just interesting how the
aspergillus thing is not even on their
[SPEAKER_00]: radar for European cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been such a big issue here in
the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I have any comments on
it other than I didn't realize how serious
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mycotoxin is produced by the
species that can show up on in cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: in, you know, edible crops, corn and just
how, yeah, just how dangerous it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had kind of always just, you know,
sort of put it like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mold and mildew is probably not a big
deal, you know, if you have a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I listened to the presentation,
I learned it like this is actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: really serious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you talk mention corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of like peanuts and aflatoxins
that are produced potentially with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like with the production of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a it's a serious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad that we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the testing has caught up
with it to the point where we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately testing what we need to be
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a totally different issue
altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but but you look at the food
industry, you know, and if you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that webinar, it's funny that webinar
that I think was Oregon State University
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it was it the state of Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it OSU?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but that was I want to
say OSU, but it could have been the state
[SPEAKER_01]: of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the one that we were both on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching that while I was waiting to
get on my flight to go to Europe at the
[SPEAKER_00]: airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize how much money the
corn industry spent testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for if you've not seen that webinar,
you need it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting because right after
that webinar, was it Oregon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think was it New York State dropped
the aspergillus testing, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak to New York, but Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Oregon put a hold on that for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was another state followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you not watch that, it's just even
from a food history standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd kind of like to go back and rewatch
that again to process it all better,
[SPEAKER_00]: because also I didn't realize what a
diverse group aspergillus is because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're taught, you know,
aspergillus bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go to Europe and they're
talking about look at the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows you how much we don't
know and how fast we are to paint with a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad brush when we really don't
understand all those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would highly recommend to go back
and anybody to watch that, because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my complaint with it with it,
though, was basically all they were saying
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, we need to test for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can have all these negative human
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what combustion does in
relation to this or into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any solutions for how to
manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't give you any management
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I found the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what was really interesting to
me, because I didn't know that it was this
[SPEAKER_00]: big thing in in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going there to try and get
solutions, it's not it's not from a
[SPEAKER_00]: historical food standpoint, it was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of microbial stuff, the other
thing I am super duper excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm sliding down on the sofa
as the conversation goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put my head back in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so there is a company in Canada called
Anitis, and they produce a product called
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosaris, which contains Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the same type of fungus that's in
Botanogard, but it is a different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ANT strain that's in Biosaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was isolated in Canada by the research
entomologist at Anitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had the wet wool powder or
Biosaris for a while on the market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not new news.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am super, super, super excited
about is they now have it in a granular
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea with this is you
preincorporate it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for cannabis, for root avid,
this is going to be the game changer
[SPEAKER_00]: because the problem with drenching these
microbes or products, whether using
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria or Isaria or even Metarizium,
is when you put it on the soil surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is a filter and the spores,
you don't get enough high enough spore
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration deep down in the pot where
the root aphids can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, if you're in a propagation cell,
probably yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start getting to a three
gallon, seven gallon pot or bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get enough spores in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can preincorporate this so it's
homogenously mixed, the Bavaria throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil you're going to have as much
Bavaria in the bottom of the pot as the
[SPEAKER_00]: top because the root aphids are all
through that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super excited that there is this
granular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also excited for it for turf,
for things like chinch bug management and
[SPEAKER_00]: grubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of potential with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to be super excited is another
company called Lollimond.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the producers of the Metarizium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be sold as Met 52, but now they
have the Metarizium also in a granular
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask me which one's going to be
better for root aphids yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be side to side trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know some companies are trying to get
root aphid colonies going so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, you know, how these two different
fungi's perform and may come down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your soil type, what other
microbes you have in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a lot of variables,
but to have the options to preincorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: two of these fungi, either one,
you know, into the soil so you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to hand drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're there as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know from research several years
ago at the University of Vermont,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've shown that if you have Bavaria
either on rice or millet as a carrion,
[SPEAKER_00]: preincorporate in the soil, it will just
kind of kill your soil with Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when thrips drop to pupate,
it will actually kill the thrips pupating
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to see a lot of
benefits from this and I'm super excited
[SPEAKER_00]: for these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you back up a little bit for us and
talk about what Bavaria targets as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: Metarizium and what maybe those
differences are between the two for
[SPEAKER_01]: growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bavaria when you start reading about
Bavaria, you read a lot about beetles and
[SPEAKER_00]: it does a good job on beetles,
but for protected indoor ag, it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for thrips management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used for it's really good on
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids, you kind of have to tank mix it
with an insect growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't recommend it a lot for foliar
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for foliar aphids, you need to have an
IGR tanks with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really we target, you know,
thrips and whiteflies is the main target.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can infect other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Metarizium traditionally,
again, that's a bit more of a beetle
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be used heavily for management
of things like black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has done great research on that
with preincorporating it into the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing how it persists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it persists in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also infect other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, don't ask me which
one's gonna be better for root aphid,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't have the answer yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are going to be, air quote,
a little technically limited by the labels
[SPEAKER_00]: because not all these pests are on all the
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the labels are the law for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost everybody has thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, preincorporation as a thrips
preventative I think is a good safe place
[SPEAKER_00]: to recommend these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing you mentioned that I want to
go back and just highlight is you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned it's a different strain between
botanica and botanica and biosaris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we talk about these
microbials like mycorrhizal fungi or
[SPEAKER_01]: Bavaria, there is going to be a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's, and I talked about this
in a recent podcast I did, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rhizophagus irregularis is not
the same from different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One might be slightly, have slightly more
drought tolerance or perform better at
[SPEAKER_01]: this pH range or, you know, deal with a
certain temperature better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't, you know, we can't just use the
word Bavaria and assume that it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, so people have to do a little
research or maybe try one Bavaria in your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that doesn't work, don't assume that
all Bavaria won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try a different one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, just, just something I wanted to
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently on the market to make things
clear, as far as strains of Bavaria
[SPEAKER_00]: bassiana that is EPA registered,
there are three different strains on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the GHA strain that's in a
botanogard, which by the way, so everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: knows is not sold by BioWorks anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot go to BioWorks for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been given now to OHP chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next one is the ANT strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one that comes from Anetis
that they discovered up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is Bavaria bassiana
and that's 5339.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a strain that is sold,
that's in velifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Velifer is a liquid product, botanogard
comes as wettable powder and liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biosaris comes as liquid, wettable
powder and granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be kind of confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually put in at several meetings
to do, I'm actually going to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be in Colorado, Denver in
three weeks, which by the time this is
[SPEAKER_00]: posted, it may be then, but I'm going to
be at the Pro Green Expo and I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole talk just on these microbial
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference, different
formulations, when you use what and really
[SPEAKER_00]: go into depth on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, on the Bavaria, there's
basically three different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to what used to be
called isaria, which is now the genus has
[SPEAKER_00]: changed to cordyceps and it's firmarososa,
which I always struggle over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are in the US market currently two
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the Apopka strain that was
isolated by the University of Florida in
[SPEAKER_00]: Apopka and that is what is in Ancora and
PFR 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the 9901 strain that is
from, I'm pretty sure it's from Spain and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where it's produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the active ingredient in nofly
and isorid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isorid is the one from Copert,
nofly is one that's generally sold by
[SPEAKER_00]: several different distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even inside of the cordyceps isaria,
there's two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the metarysium, currently on
the market in the US, there's only one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and that's the F52 and that's being
sold under Lollegard and that is from
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollimond, if you can keep that all
straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen different efficacy with
different strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have an answer to that
because the problem is every media is
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked several times if
researchers would do head-to-head
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons under the same soils,
the same pests, the same environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody's really done research on that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have good answers,
but I will say generally as what you said
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we do, we try one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't work, then we try another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't work, we try another one
until we find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works for your soil, your
moisture, and also your microbes because I
[SPEAKER_00]: do think there's some competition between
all these microbes going in the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these entomopathogens and some of
them are being out-competed or even eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: up by things that are already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could do a trial, let's say in
a soil-less media, you know, let's grow
[SPEAKER_00]: even like a sterile perlite and throw a
root aphids in there, throw, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in there and throw each one of
these products in there and one may
[SPEAKER_00]: outperform it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you go to your greenhouse and
actually do it in your soil type,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get a completely different result.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately with pesticides that are
EPA registered, you get the strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get that strain name separated out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with something like mycorrhizal fungi
or other, you know, some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: bacillus species, you don't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and to further complicate things,
you know, there may only be a few,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's only two, three manufacturers of
mycorrhizal fungi, like endomycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, when we talk about like
rhizophagus, irregularis, glomus,
[SPEAKER_01]: interatuses that I'm aware of currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not buying from,
you know, Dino Myco, RTI or Premier,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably buying from a reseller
that's buying it in and relabeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, it gets even more
complicated to figure out what strain you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually tried, I guess, is what I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the microbial side, when we talk about,
you know, fertilizer, bio-stimulant
[SPEAKER_01]: products versus pesticides, where at least
you know, you know, the strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the strain name of what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's one advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, this whole thing about these
bio-stimulants, you know, buyer beware
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're really not being regulated
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of a mutual acquaintance of ours did,
he got a package of a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated out the spore size,
calculated it out according to the number
[SPEAKER_00]: that said it was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he did the math, the number of
spores they were claimed were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: package would physically not even fit in
the package they claimed that was in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you have to be very careful,
especially where you're getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes from, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very careful with all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anything else that you wanted to
touch on here today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I could go on forever,
but you know, we've kind of already
[SPEAKER_00]: eclipsed over an hour and we don't want to
keep people too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I will apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to get social media content
out, but I say this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, when you're out in the field
working, you don't have time to make posts
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have ideas of great posts in my
head, but it's just with, with traveling,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, almost every single week,
I struggle to keep up with posting on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I'm too busy to post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my new resolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd said I have to make three posts a
week, according to a scientific one,
[SPEAKER_00]: a personal one and of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten none of that done yet so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one post from the show this week,
a picture of me and some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said three posts are like the thing
you're supposed to do to stay active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably the last person to talk to
when it comes to social media stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that sounds like good advice to me now
that I'm hearing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that you were helping us with
that I want to mention that we were,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we just have to get one more look
over by you before we release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I'm mentioning is because I
think it brings up an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see these, these beneficial bug
guides that say, you know, this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this benefit, this predatory might or
beneficial targets this pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's so much more complicated than
that, as I've learned from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may, they may target this pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may, they may have a secondary pest
that they'll, they'll eat, but not as
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively, or they may eat something,
this other pest, but only if there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: other food source around and they're in a
Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really isn't effective in real
life to buy, you know, say this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: insect to deal with this particular pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you helped us come up with a guide
that kind of breaks that down a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more saying, you know, this likes to eat
this, it might feed on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though there's research showing
it does occasionally eat this other bug,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't count on getting any sort of
suppression or protection from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I praise that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, there's a difference of does
it eat it or does it control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the, the new, okay,
I wasn't going to go into any more
[SPEAKER_00]: information, but we're going to go into
more information that ties into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that has really come to light
with us, uh, working on this new,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, invasive thrips, this parvy spinous,
um, thrips, uh, it's thrips, parvy
[SPEAKER_00]: spinous, thrips is the genus parvy,
parvy spinous is the species is that how
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at bio controls, you get different
results on different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the leaf structures of the plants,
which makes it even more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're finding, and what I have
seen anecdotally out in the field on
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple crops is that really smooth
leafed plants, uh, ficus, croton,
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites tend not to like to want
to be on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, they like dementia on the
undersides of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to lay their eggs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things like Cucameras and Swirsky
will tend to leave those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at crops like peppers and even
cannabis, they've got all those hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to be on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're targeting a thrips species,
those mites will probably stay around
[SPEAKER_00]: better on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say better around better on things
like cannabis and peppers, where when we
[SPEAKER_00]: try to control that same thrips species
over on, let's say crotons or ficus,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not work because the mites don't
want to stay on the plant because of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it getting more
complicated, does, does it eat it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at plant structure is making a
difference on management selection these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that, but that makes sense
when you say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else, uh, shall we end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, hopefully I will see some of
you around at some of the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't be shy about coming up and
talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be as open as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As friendly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I'll be down,
um, next week, uh, which I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like the, like the 14th,
I'm going to be down at TPI in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, the following week,
I'm going to be up in Minneapolis at,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there's a big, uh, nursery greenhouse
trade show up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be out at the pro green
expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm going to be speaking there on
microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cultivate every year,
um, the bio controls conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is now called bio solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to do a workshop at that on,
uh, regenerative pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focusing more on a bit more on outdoor
production and talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: attracting in beneficials, conservation of
beneficials and, you know, sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: for pest management out of the bio
solutions conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be out there in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I think, I think the first week in
March, maybe, um, I'm going to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: my schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they dropped their.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dropped their hemp cannabis track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly kind of had to say,
I had a little bit to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I will have to say,
I think the learning curve for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis guys have gotten a lot
smarter, um, and, um, have, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the, the level of the
questions I'm getting are much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the cannabis industry has grown a
lot, but I think we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's the Salinas Valley,
which is mostly big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think you would get a lot of
cannabis people coming up for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not to say cannabis people
cannot learn from it because Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Brownbridge is going to be lecturing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julie Gresh is going to be lecturing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be doing another talk there
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there is plenty to learn
because you could always learn from other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries and learn about all the new
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really the ultimate learning
curve for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only bios focused conference in
the U S that incorporates, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management, bio stimulants,
and bio fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put together our own
conference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of these days, and I'm so excited
for it because there's so many wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast guests in between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we could get some really great
speakers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I think it should be like a thing,
like a festival weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, um, well, we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to locate, we need some locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone's listening to this and knows
of a good place that we could host the
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting, preferably near some greenhouses
or grows, or we could do some onsite
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that would be a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I love doing the hands on
workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I, I just did one in December
in Michigan, um, with Michigan state,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, where we went through, you know,
beneficial applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dipping and washing cuttings for pests
and how to scout and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love doing those hands on things
instead of everybody just sitting in a
