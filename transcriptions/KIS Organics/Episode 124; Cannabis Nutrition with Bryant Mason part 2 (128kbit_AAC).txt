[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had Bryant on the podcast a few times
in the past and he's one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant is a certified crop advisor who
specializes in organic cannabis nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has spent the last five years working
to combine precision laboratory techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: with data science in an effort to unravel
the complexities of cannabis soil and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with his work on soilless media,
he also helps outdoor cultivators around
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States with nutrient management
and cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to do soil testing,
help with interpreting a soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are interested in an online course on
these subjects, his website is www
[SPEAKER_00]: .soiledoctorconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to save $100 on his
course, you can use the discount code
[SPEAKER_00]: KISOrganics, all one word, and I've taken
his course and was recently going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: review some of the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's excellent and I highly recommend it
for anyone wanting to do a deep dive on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis fertility and reusing your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we are jumping back in with part two
of my conversation with Bryant Mason
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about soil fertility and cannabis
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we talk about potassium but
briefly?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite loquacious with the calcium,
so we can condense it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potassium, I've been thinking a lot
about due to the fact that for years I've
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended potassium sulfate for
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because, well, two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that I always suggest compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not always, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also suggest compost, which is a major
source of potassium, but the content of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium varies between compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look at a soil test,
it's often in the middle of a round,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it needs potassium immediately,
sometimes going into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potassium sulfate's the best organic
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium silicate is not technically
organic when it's soil applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's allowed in certain circumstances as a
fungicide, foliar applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nutritionally, it's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potassium sulfate's kind of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've made a couple changes in the last
year in my thinking around potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe growers should verify their
need for potassium with a tissue test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they get a recommendation that says
use this much potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: best practice would be to verify with a
tissue test, because oftentimes I'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively low potassium, at least below
my target level, but there's sufficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tissue test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an application of potassium sulfate
is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen that many tissue tests
that show deficient potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible, I'm re-evaluating my
soil target slightly, and I might lower
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's just one change I'm
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is because of that high
solubility of potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe growers should increase the
frequency of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say the soil doctor tool
recommends a cup per cubic yard of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium sulfate, which would be a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend doing a cup all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you can break that into four to
10 applications, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, you're reducing the salt
stress, but also when you flood the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution with that much potassium,
it will completely change the cation
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to Epsom salts and
potassium sulfate, Epsom salts are usually
[SPEAKER_01]: not used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend it very often as a soil
dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium sulfate, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those two, you increase the
frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final thing is I do think
it's good to be constantly building
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium levels, slow releasing,
more organic, meaning carbon-based sources
[SPEAKER_01]: of potassium, using alternatives like
compost and alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason alfalfa meal is so great,
and I know you've always used a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always, I recommend it as kind of
one of the few default nitrogen sources
[SPEAKER_01]: when I write recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, because of the more slow
releasing nature of it and the trichotinol
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the biosimulant effects,
but now it's because it also brings in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you apply alfalfa,
it doesn't have a ton of nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're applying a large quantity
and it also brings in a lot of potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's slow releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say green sand, but green sand I
don't think in cannabis makes sense
[SPEAKER_01]: because heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just always be applying high potassium
compost or just any moderate potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and use alfalfa meal as one of the
nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the second place,
sort of the silver and bronze medal would
[SPEAKER_01]: be insect frass, which I know you love,
and granular poultry, which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two both bring in about 4% potash,
K2O.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think those are the things I'd
say about potassium is just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not entirely, but thinking about other
sources as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of my favorite
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that every grower
needs to have in their pantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I want to do a talk on that here
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products I think every grower should
have, and they're not really products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're things like gypsum and potassium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not expensive, but you want to
have them on hand for when you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, 50% potassium, highly
soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a potassium deficiency,
you want to address one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the fastest and best way to get
potassium into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you brought up, I think, is really
interesting in terms of splitting up your
[SPEAKER_00]: applications to lower the salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to think about that a little bit
and see how I can incorporate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned compost, and while I think
compost is great, I have moved away from
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending it quite as much for a few
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, you're reintroducing fungus gnats
that next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a commercial scale, it's just annoying
and can get expensive with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, relatively easy to deal with,
but still annoying, bringing in bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a vector for pathogens,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've stopped doing compost additions
every cycle just for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that not everyone tests their
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost can be inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they have one test showing
it's high potassium one cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next cycle that compost source could
be something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as
I used to be in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just some things for people to think
about as they're determining what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to add each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love insect frass, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got good microbial activity and life
in it in addition to having a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced NPK value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have to account for the other
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The N and the P that you're bringing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then alfalfa meal, like you said,
it's such a low NPK value for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The N it brings in is pretty negligible
and it just has a ton of different other
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichontinol is interesting because I
think from talking to a plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone guy, I'm going to butcher his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jim Gray maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jim something or other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interviewed on it a little while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a retired plant hormone guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that trichontinol breaks down
so quickly that unless you're putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: actual alfalfa and just laying it on the
surface, that trichontinol is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't apply alfalfa for the
trichontinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to clarify, I would not apply
alfalfa insect frass or granulated poultry
[SPEAKER_01]: for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would choose those products for nitrogen
knowing that a secondary benefit is it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: build potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you always fulfill your nitrogen
deficit first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add further that I don't like
to use potassium sulfate all that
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently when reamending my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: At high rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is so soluble, I like to use it
during the growth cycle kind of as that
[SPEAKER_00]: like liquid bottled nutrient sort of
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my band aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except you don't have to use liquid
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so my liquid bottled nutrient is
fish hydrolysis usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my go to when I see a problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few things I use in bottles and
they're not yeah, one of them is liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would mention with compost,
for those who have received
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations from me, you usually don't
see compost because I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your sodium is high or your nitrogen is
high or your salts are too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gone back and forth about
recommending it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I don't know what it is,
I mean, there's just such a wild
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between horse manure and worm
castings made in someone's basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just it varies so much that
unless I have a test, which I rarely do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like recommending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to fungus snaps,
there's a number of other considerations
[SPEAKER_01]: with compost for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the carbon nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that can really that can really screw
people up quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't necessarily because I'm not
able to control for all those variables as
[SPEAKER_01]: just writing a soil recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I too have sort of strayed away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I just mentioned it because it
is a good potassium source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can account for all those other
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think an interesting way to get the
amendments out is to use compost to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: them in with a little bit of compost to
get that biology in there when you're top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing, when you're amending,
mix it in with a little bit of soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: apply some of those amendments into your
worm bin or into your compost piles way of
[SPEAKER_00]: raising the fertility of the pile itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, this is a little
off topic, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been having this discussion on a
soil analyst forum with Steve Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: because someone posted a a soil recipe
that they found online for living soil for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got into this huge discussion
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my my point, and I think you'll agree
with me on this one, is all living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes, all soil recipes should be based
around your compost because it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I always start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see a recipe online that says,
you know, 20 percent earthworm castings or
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 percent compost, that fraction is going
to vary so much and determine what the
[SPEAKER_00]: other inputs are that I don't trust any of
these recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say this as someone as a
manufacturer who sells a nutrient pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is designed to be mixed with,
you know, either something like ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: forest or pro mix or you make your own
sort of living soil by taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, our mineral nutrient pack and
adding compost and peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with that, my degree of
confidence goes down because that compost
[SPEAKER_00]: can can, like you said, it can it can be
imbalanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have way too much nitrogen,
ammonium, you know, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I don't like soil recipes
and I don't people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many requests I've
had for like, do you have a soil recipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's because the compost
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like to kind of piggyback on that is I
get requests like I want to make my own
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that, I always say, like,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just say, but just so you understand
the process for me, like for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: formulate a soil is going to take,
let's say, six months aggressively at best
[SPEAKER_00]: to probably two years realistically before
it be something that I want to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: with my name on it, because the amount
like initially you got to find your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to mix up a soil and see what
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get everything where you
want on the soil test, then you do plant
[SPEAKER_00]: trials and see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that process just takes a really
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do it right, you know,
you can't just throw a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_00]: together, throw a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it grows well, assume that you've
got this amazing soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're a home grower, I think
that's that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absolutely encourage
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on a commercial scale,
that's just not practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I would add to that,
like the first thing I coach people to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is to not even worry about the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first you worry about the chemistry
of the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you test as many compost as you have
access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you you choose the right sweet or
single compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go you forget the chemistry,
you choose those combos, and then you just
[SPEAKER_01]: do like physical tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you try to get your percentages right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want you put it in the bed or the
pot and you water it and you want and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just you feel it and you watch the
infiltration rate and you have to dial in
[SPEAKER_01]: the percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go back to the chemistry and
you just get the base mix right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you do the any of the amendments,
because to me, you want to customize your
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments based on what your your base
mix is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go through all of this in my course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, like you said, the process is
potentially totally worthwhile,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no doubt, laborious and long and
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a simple coots mix or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to do it right,
it's a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and even Coot says, like,
you don't have his mix because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have his vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I hear people that say,
you know, coot mix works really well for
[SPEAKER_00]: me and other people that say, like,
this this is a terrible recipe and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's not balanced at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we chat about iron real quick before
we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it's sort of similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've evolved my thinking on iron,
iron sulfate specifically, but iron in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, because I have observed wildly
varying levels on tissue tests of iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to know because iron
contaminates both soil samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more so tissue samples all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contaminates soil samples sometimes on
the pace test because little pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or clay specifically can slip through
the filter paper at the lab and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: show a really high iron level on a pace
test, which isn't a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's more important is if you have dust
on a tissue test on any tissue sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: that dust can can go through the tissue
test and show that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinarily high levels of iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also just could be that the plant
actually will sometimes accumulate huge
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of iron at different points,
mostly further into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes I'll just see really high
iron levels and sometimes I'll see really
[SPEAKER_01]: low iron levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some growers that my
recommendations of iron sulfate have not
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to effectively address their
iron hunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say deficiency because
it's not usually not so acute that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually just we're seeing it in the
data and I can't get that that number to
[SPEAKER_01]: move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost I'm almost I'm 100
percent confidence because iron sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you apply it, it oxidizes very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine like the chemical reaction of
rusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once it oxidizes, it goes into an
ionic state that's not available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you drench iron sulfate in a
high oxygen soil and in a high pH soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I say high pH, I mean anything
over six, it could oxidize like
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately, even with a humic substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, when you mix iron sulfate
with humic acid and you drench it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil pH of seven, I think it oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the and and the data
constantly humbles me because I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I always just follow the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it tells me I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a big learning for me is,
you know, in these soils that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working in, I think iron is oxidizing and
very little of it is making into the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say you shouldn't apply iron
sulfate because I do think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something to say about loading your soil
with iron which will be reduced in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere or about, you know,
in with different sort of magical
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere reactions and organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if your plant needs iron,
a better technique may be to core the iron
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, 50-50 iron sulfate and elemental
sulfur somewhere in your root zone in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say core, I mean like a pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pocket of iron sulfate and elemental
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it creates this
little pocket of a low pH environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: really low, like in the fours maybe,
and at least in the fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps the iron in a reduced form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't what I've learned again in
tree fruit production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a technique I get from orcharding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orchardists can have an iron efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their whole canopy is like that sort of
yellow chlorotic look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they core just a little bit of iron
sulfate at the base of their trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works very quickly and their trees
can green up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean you could also throw a
little manganese sulfate in there
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But manganese sulfate to me is more
effective with a drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you create that pocket in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots can just tap into that little
pocket and take up iron in the available
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only other thing I'll mention
there is again, there are alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use alfalfa meal and blood meal for
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you're using those for nitrogen,
not for iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in doing so, you're bringing in a lot
of slow releasing organically complexed
[SPEAKER_01]: iron into your soil system, which will
help prevent the iron hunger in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, I see this all the time in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing commercially six years ago
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tops of the plants would always be
a little bit yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought, because a lot of
plants, it's just sort of normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always green up eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that sort of top shoot growth,
that new apical growth, when it's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: light color, I always attribute that to
iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I just follow the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to just look at what the tissue
numbers say and address it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't thought as much about iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Hudson, who you mentioned before,
we've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: His point was that, yes, the plant may
need a little more iron right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just because it can't keep up
with the amount of growth it's getting at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just going to green up and go
away because it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't really addressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing when you said low pH and
pocket, my brain immediately just went
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we putting ourselves more at risk for
heavy metal uptake by having a pocket of
[SPEAKER_00]: low pH soil in the rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my mental model to answer that
question is that the nutrient uptake is
[SPEAKER_01]: evenly distributed across the entire bulk
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pocket is probably less than 1% of
the bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you're going to make heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially more available in that pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking the size of your fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the heavy metals will be more
available in a pocket of soil the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: your fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just such a small pocket of
soil that unless you had a large heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metal load, I don't think it should
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so dilute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not dilute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also don't want to then throw off
all my soil tests moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, so that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you start coring iron sulfate,
you have to ignore the iron number on the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put your soil test through the
soil doctor tool, you have to disregard
[SPEAKER_01]: the iron sulfate recommendation coming out
of that tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to go solely off of tissue
tests and visuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the soil is non-homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're either going to see low iron
because when you're sampling your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't hit that pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to show or you're going
to hit the pocket and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really high iron on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those situations are suboptimal
and they're not accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go off tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done this with cannabis and seen
that immediate greening of new growth then
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the growers I work with do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so people have tried this and seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten reports of the visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the top growth yellowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't asked that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see is the tissue test finally
moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they but they but the grower who
did it did it kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of people have done it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first one who did it was did it at
a rate that was maybe a little too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said they they seemed to have a little
bit more transplant shock, but they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: out grew out of it really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that means you lower the rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think transplant shock is ever
good, especially from a fertilizer.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him to cut the rate in half and and
do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy had a really cool guy up in
Michigan, worked with a lot tests like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bandit, and so he's got this amazing body
of data and we just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like iron sulfate every round and the
numbers just wouldn't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally we got him to move with this
this core.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to think about that and that's
actually a really good segue into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: topic, which is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe not the best segue,
but my point is you'll see products now
[SPEAKER_00]: and we talked about this a little before
the podcast, how there's products out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, primarily with
micronutrients that are approved for use
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're supposedly like organic forms
of these minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the derivation
statement, the ingredients, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from sulfates, so you may have
like an organic manganese product,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at what it's derived
from, it's derived from manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are these products really any more
organic or really better than just
[SPEAKER_00]: applying the manganese sulfate directly?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realize this isn't exactly what we're
talking about, but I want to touch start
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amino chelated micronutrient
products that I see that are certified
[SPEAKER_01]: organic are primarily for foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're referring to?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking bio man albion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was using this year my orchard
polyamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what those are is you're right,
they take these disorder of raw mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments like let's say zinc sulfate and
they combine them with amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the same amino acids we're using
which is ground up soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pulverized like soluble soy based
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the most, I don't
actually know how they're made because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's proprietary, but that's probably like
the rudimentary way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mix them together and they chelate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you combine those two things,
it chelates them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in theory, it keeps them more
available so when they hit the plant leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to oxidize as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just better leaf penetration
with amino acids, better uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're getting more unit of
nutrient into the plant, which I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if the increase in foliar efficiency
offsets the increase in cost of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wondered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wondered should I just apply
iron sulfate chelated with fulvic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be way more cost
effective on three acres than applying
[SPEAKER_01]: albion metallisate iron, which costs quite
a bit of money?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, different micronutrients are
chelated better with different individual
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So manganese, for example, is a little
tougher to chelate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might use an amino acid like
pyroglycine or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are they more organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is your definition of organic just
certified organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're both manganese sulfate and
bottled chelated manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if they're more organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you are applying it with carbon,
which is way preferable foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do molasses and a little bit of
a touch of kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not in cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a touch of molasses and fulvic acid
would be a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: My issue is there's no way to know how
much better they are, if that uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency and the nutrient use efficiency
inside the plant is that much better to
[SPEAKER_01]: justify the cost of these branded chelated
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always used them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, I'm breaking my farm in
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't actually testing this specific
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm breaking my farm in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do every organic foliar,
calcium foliar specifically, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: JDOM stuff and a lot of these branded
amino chelated products on half of my
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to do a single calcium
foliar on the other half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious to see if any of them
are really making that big of a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to just pitch to every grower
listening that they should be split
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time there's an expensive input.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, you can't do too many split
tests, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should break your bedroom in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you should break your field in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you should break your grow tent in
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do no treatment on half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do the treatment on the other half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's amazing the level of faith
that growers have in products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in part, you kind of have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you just have to believe something
and then do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm here to say, to argue,
if possible, break your room in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be a little less faithful and
actually put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a characteristic I see in
so many really good growers who I've
[SPEAKER_01]: spoken to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is they're constantly testing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's just one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, I mean, preferably one thing at
a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Split test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever is your highest cost input.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're not 100% confident is
justifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of products that are hyped to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not even unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in ag, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll go to an ag conference and
I'll be talking to a guy and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're obviously selling a lot of your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the salesmen,
too, they believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard because when another human
looks you in the eyes and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: conviction that something works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a natural tendency to want to
believe them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's like a character flaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's part of human bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all just should be fighting
against it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point, I'm testing these
foliars primarily because every tree fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: grower in my area is spending an enormous
amount of money on amino chelated foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody knows if they actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either think they work or they think
they don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so split tests are the only way to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not scientific in that there's
not replicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't find statistical
significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just want enough evidence to make
the right management decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So split tests are totally great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to your point, realistically,
we just have to know what works in our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, in our environment, in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how effective it is in
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters what works for me here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many variables involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about temperature,
moisture, environment, water, sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are going to come into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm consulting and I walk into a
facility and I say, show me what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me what you're doing for fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that list is really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what is doing what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just simplify everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to use that height
product that you saw on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's work it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come back to a baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's do some of that split
testing, A, B testing, and C, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting results from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
all we're doing as growers is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: address what the limiting factor of growth
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Liebig's law of the minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that if the limiting factor is
the minimum, is the fact that our facility
[SPEAKER_00]: has lights that are 400 PPFD in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what enzyme or ferment
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to add to that, I was talking to a
grower the other day on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time he does a foliar
application for IPM, it's $6,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a significant chunk of money that
he has to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're a pretty large farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's strictly just
product or labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was just the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a more expensive IPM product,
a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if he's having to spray these things
on his crop, it adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the home grower, it may not seem
like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: $10, $20, whatever for a similar
comparative scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no reason we can't grow
healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For significantly less money, if we just
start thinking about this idea of split
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, and I would also argue,
let's just put money aside, which
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously is everything when it comes to
commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way to become a better grower
is to start to tease out what that
[SPEAKER_01]: low-hanging fruit or what that bottleneck
is in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just want to improve your
general ability, as a grower, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to reduce inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what I'm trying to get at
is you have to be constantly learning
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaizen all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're not going to be
improving yourself like you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk a little bit
about amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's something that you've been
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just covered a little bit of how people
are using amino acids as foliars because I
[SPEAKER_00]: suppose they have better efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me your thoughts on that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the brief synopsis on amino acids as it
relates to plant nutrition is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, there's a few things that come to
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that amino acids are
definitely the best source of
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar-applied nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's quite a bit of research that
shows that, particularly in field crop
[SPEAKER_01]: production, that the nitrogen use,
the nitrogen uptake from amino acid
[SPEAKER_01]: sources of nitrogen is by far better than
any other nitrogen source foliar-applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big proponent of amino acids in foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this idea of metabolic
short-cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this before,
where if a plant does uptake nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the form of amino acids, or any organic
form, doesn't necessarily have to be amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants can actually uptake larger
compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this idea that they save quite a
bit of metabolic energy by not having to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce other forms of nitrogen,
like nitrate or ammonium, into amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plants because they uptake them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already in amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is definitely a well-documented
phenomenon but not studied very
[SPEAKER_01]: extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research generally shows,
I've done a deep dive on nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_01]: organic sources, and it generally shows
that the maximum nitrogen use efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: results when the plant uptakes various
forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of that metabolic
short-cutting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So major props to organic production in
this regard because all of our nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, being applied in organic form
with carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the body of research is sadly lacking
when it comes to organic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic forms of nitrogen, like amino
acids, have essentially been ignored as a
[SPEAKER_01]: third pool of plant-available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a few studies that show that
when you incorporate carbon-based amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid nitrogen, it increases nitrogen use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what's important to point out
for the cannabis community is that all
[SPEAKER_01]: organic products are either composed of
amino acids or end up as amino acids for a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time in the process of
mineralization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what is confusing or maybe
misleading is that we say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna use amino acid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, does that mean amino acids like a
water-soluble liquid nitrogen from soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: or fish that's technically marketed as
amino acid nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because alfalfa meal, blood meal,
feather meal, all of these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymatically digested in the soil and end
up in their constituent parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I think about it is when you're
amending your soil with organic amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: that are nitrogen and carbon in protein
form, those are essentially going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a little amino acid factory in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those things, as those mineralize,
they are going to end up as amino acids in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, the plant will
uptake some of those amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's debatable how much of those amino
acids are uptaken, before the amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: are then converted into ammonium and then
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these three different forms all
exist in your soil at the same time and
[SPEAKER_01]: all organic products are converted are
technically going to contribute amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little misleading to say I want
amino acid nitrogen because anything
[SPEAKER_01]: organic is in a sense going to lead to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether I buy a soy amino product or
soybean meal, I'm still going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting amino acids in my soil because of
how they're gonna break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the amino acid nitrogen from soybean
meal is going to be immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smaller particle size and potentially
already digested into the constituent
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna get amino acids faster,
but they're both doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ending up at the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll add one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out a video on my Instagram about
amino acids a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point in that video is to say that
when you drench amino acids to the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, there's not a good understanding of
how much of that is directly uptaken by
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and how much of it is eaten by
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or converted by microbes into ammonium and
then nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these pools are constantly in flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my argument is that again,
just a tiny bit of research out there
[SPEAKER_01]: shows that the microbes feed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the majority of the liquid soy
based amino acids that we're applying are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably consumed by the microbes,
not the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't really a major reason
other than to just try to point out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in our soil systems because even
though even if the microbes eat those
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids, they'll die and release
organic forms of nitrogen back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just interesting to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: My general belief is that the microbes
feed first and amino acids can turn over
[SPEAKER_01]: in soil extremely quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's just another small
dynamic for growers to understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I'm a little unclear on
is if the amino acids are if nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: in an amino acid form, is that different
than a nitrate and ammonium in a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening inside the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said if it goes into the plant,
then it's converted to ammonium and then
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would that be superior to just
nitrates in your soil, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plant's just taking up a
nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a plant takes up a nitrate,
it has to convert it twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It essentially has to go in reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to convert to ammonium and then
amino acids to complex it into a leaf as a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the plant uptakes an amino acid,
it doesn't have to convert it twice,
[SPEAKER_01]: which takes a huge, there's a huge
energetic cost to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it takes it up as an amino acid,
it can just put it directly into a protein
[SPEAKER_01]: and complex it into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're skipping two different steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside the plant, if the plant uptakes an
amino acid and by amino acid, it
[SPEAKER_01]: technically any organic form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be other molecules besides
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then how do we correlate this with a
soil test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on a soil test, we're primarily
looking at nitrate levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep ammonium levels very low
and that nitrogen cycling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that relate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, that is a million dollar
question because we're not testing on a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not testing organic forms of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just seeing ammonium and nitrate and
we're making our management decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: based on those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a limitation in soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways that labs can test organic
nitrogen, but it gets complicated and
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing because there's different
fractions and there's different,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a totally different lab technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a simple way to just test
small amino acids, the small fraction of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nitrogen compounds, which is amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wrote a long blog post about this
called how to manage nitrogen organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my, it's on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I break this down, but to answer your
question to add more specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are just using ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to see two out of the three pools
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't get to see that third pool
and we're just using ammonium and nitrate
[SPEAKER_01]: as a proxy to sort of understand how big
those pools are because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my, the reason I'm comfortable
using ammonium and nitrate and not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: that organic nitrogen pool on a soil test
is because if the organic nitrogen pool is
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, you will end up seeing ammonium
and nitrate because the microbes convert,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's excess organic nitrogen,
excess amino acids, it ends up as nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see that nitrate number,
you know, between let's just say 50 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 150, you know that there was, at one point
there was an excess of that organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen pool and it converted in nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the, the nitrate number low,
usually that means there's not excess
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nitrogen in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are sort of proxies,
if that makes sense to, to estimating how
[SPEAKER_01]: big that organic pool is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers I know intentionally keep
their nitrogen, their inorganic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrate and ammonium, they keep those
pools low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a soil test, it might be 15 parts
per million or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they feed those organic sources of
nitrogen as the plant needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they do so primarily based on
visual symptoms and occasional tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil testing is flawed in that respect,
in my opinion, for organic growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still want to know ammonium and
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good proxy for organic nitrogen,
but it's, it's not a direct measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then along those lines, that total
nitrogen number that you can also get
[SPEAKER_00]: from, on the standard test, that's not
really showing us that either then,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that one's not good is because
it's also like, if you imagine a chunk of
[SPEAKER_01]: alfalfa meal, that's not plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still a protein meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's still plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that nitrogen has not been
enzymatically broken down, biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: digested into small enough organic
nitrogen pieces, amino acids to be taken
[SPEAKER_01]: up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that total nitrogen number is going to
give you all the nitrogen in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: much of which is not yet plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amino acids, they're the building
blocks of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins exist in these amendments like
fish meal, blood meal, alfalfa meal we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, specifically in relation to
nitrogen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those get broken down biologically through
nutrient cycling, microbial processes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's released from that is
potentially all three forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is what you're saying then?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get some organic amino acids,
some nitrates, some ammoniums,
[SPEAKER_00]: some ammonium, depending on what's going
on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are all tied closely too,
to moisture content and oxygen gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just touch on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's the nitrogen transformations
are highly dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on moisture and oxygen because they're
biologically driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the third variable that I think
actually matters even more is temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conversion, if you put in feather
meal in your soil and it's cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could take weeks or months to really
become available to be broken down
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically into those three nitrogen
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a warm soil, it happens very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and obviously there's higher
biological activity when soil moisture is
[SPEAKER_01]: optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when gas exchange is optimal,
when gas exchange is not optimal,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the nitrogen can essentially,
that cycle will get plugged up and
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be more ammonium usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I almost never see that in a peat
based media in any kind of living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost never see that just because gas
exchange is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a mucky topsoil,
like a really clay heavy compacted muck.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do see is once you amend the soil,
or if you were to blend your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would, there'd be so much organic
nitrogen that goes into that system that
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil would cook and ammonium levels
would spike for a period of time before
[SPEAKER_01]: they get, they go back down and get
converted into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to test your soil right
after amending, you could see high
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium if that soil is biologically
active as it's converting it to nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you, have you seen that before?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw that recently on a test and it
kind of surprised me because I typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: when my brain, when I see a high ammonium
numbers, I automatically go to unfinished
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just where I head.
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more, I'm thinking of peat based
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me call them living soils because a
peat based media with a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of think of them like compost
because they're, they're bi, they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically active and they're increasing
in maturity over time through,
[SPEAKER_01]: through biological mineralization and
fungal decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, yeah, it's unfinished compost
is a great corollary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially when you throw a bunch of
blood meal and alfalfa meal and bone meal
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and fish compost into peat moss and
cocoa core, it essentially creates a
[SPEAKER_01]: little compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it cooks and that's what that
temperature, when you, when you,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you like feel that temperature after
you really mix a soil, when the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature spikes, if you tested it at
that moment in time, I'd almost guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: that the ammonium would be elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what I, I aim to do when I'm
amending a soil is I want to get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: in there at the beginning of a run that I
can without going, without triggering that
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal process, because I don't want to
wait for the soil to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call cook, like, like a
thermophilic compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal, and so, the goal is then to
amend at a rate that's high fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but low enough that we're not causing this
explosion of microbial growth that's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing this temperature increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's really the trick,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put a little note for, for growers
who have received soil recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: from me, there's a little note in the
nitrogen, I have nitrogen tips and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them is says, please let me know if your
soil heats up because I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I can adjust my rates to be what
you said is right under that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that temperature increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some products are more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, blood meal is way more prone to
creating temperature spikes because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: speed at which it releases just the
properties of certain nitrogen amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll sometimes cause that and you can
also smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can smell that ammonium,
um, volatilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important to have your
moisture content, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your temperature, you know, in your room
is if, if it's an indoor facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm typically thinking about it,
the temperature is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about that as
much, but I think making sure you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: over or under watering is really important
to allow that process to occur the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you can always add more,
you know, a couple of weeks later or a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later to get to the, get to your
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to get it all in there
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, just some other notes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, since you talked about amino
acids and the fact that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily need to buy products that are
labeled amino acids to get amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, I've recently seen some
products that are called carbon based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this idea that because they're
carbon based, um, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: superior to other fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you and I talked about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the, in organic farming,
that label is kind of meaningless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because for the most part,
most of our, or let me back up,
[SPEAKER_01]: not all of our nutrients are always carbon
based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were talking about potassium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in general, there's a lot of
benefit to, to using nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of baked into organic
farming when it comes to your phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: products and your nitrogen products and,
and just, you know, the mineralization of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so when someone says this is a carbon
based nitrogen product, it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it doesn't, it's sort of a,
a redundant or, um, it doesn't mean a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot because all of our organic
nitrogen products are already carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gained a lot of popularity in
conventional production because
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional growers are starting to
realize that, um, there's a major
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic and plant health advantage to
incorporating carbon into their
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the terminology, the marketing
terminology comes mostly from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the conventional world,
but I don't think it has a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning when it comes to, when,
when we're talking about organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add that when we're talking
about living soils, you know, P based soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we have high levels of carbon in
those mixes already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, our organic matter is, you know,
through the roof compared to anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: would see in actual soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's really important to
distinguish between living soil and real
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can't emphasize that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, it's like an apple and a banana or
something, or, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: two very distinctly different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, both can grow plants, but they do it
in entirely different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's probably a separate
podcast, but I just think it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing to, to remind folks of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also mention that, um, like,
for example, when I furtigate and we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about this earlier, when I
furtigate micronutrient sulfates,
[SPEAKER_01]: so just going to kind of tying this around
when I need more manganese sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'll put in 10 pounds per acre in an
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always add a carbon, some kind of carbon
source, whether that's molasses or kelp or
[SPEAKER_01]: usually it's humic acids that I dissolve
overnight or even citric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always am aiming to apply carbon with
any application that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really easy to do that as an
organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you just do the things I just
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are very familiar with
this, a compost extract, or if you're top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing, you know, something you can
apply a little compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once that goes into your soil,
like you said, in a living soil system,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many carbon fractions in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from, there's a lot of soluble carbon,
a lot of active carbon, a lot of longer
[SPEAKER_01]: chain, the inactive carbon compounds in
our compost and our peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this is just happening in our
living soils naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's not essential to necessarily
do that because as soon as it hits our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, it's a giant carbon sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in a top soil system, I think it
makes a lot of sense, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: furtigation, but we don't necessarily need
to buy bottled products that are carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: based because we can just add a little
humic acid or fulvic acid or molasses and
[SPEAKER_01]: do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know we kind of went over some of
your favorite nitrogen inputs already and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you like to have multiple sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little about your favorite
calcium inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give me, and I don't want to,
you know, dive too deep into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just some of your favorite,
uh, phosphorus and, um, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, I already know the one for
magnesium, but go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some of your other major essential
nutrient amendments, like what you like to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium, um, really, I only think of
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Epsom salt and one is, uh,
langbenite and langbenite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only use when potassium is also needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a, it's kind of a niche use
case, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's probably only about 10% of my
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I think plants need magnesium,
I immediately go to Epsom salt and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I immediately go to Epsom salt and
foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing I think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally inexpensive and it's super
effective in foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing I do is I hit my
plants with a, with an Epsom salt foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they respond positively,
it usually is an indicator that indeed
[SPEAKER_01]: they're low in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then only then I would think about a
soil dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that, I think that covers
magnesium pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run magnesium on the low side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think growers I work with tend to
see magnesium hunger because I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: just run it kind of on the lower end of
the spectrum, uh, because I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize calcium and potassium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's so easy to feed that I don't
necessarily want to load my soil with
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to keep it low and,
and apply it as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I have found that different strains
vary pretty widely in their magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of them just, just get hungry for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like a tomato, tomatoes like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what were you going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just want to add that I rarely see
magnesium deficiencies on living soils
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, if you have, if you're
mixing a living soil, you don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a magnesium input.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably getting enough magnesium
from your compost and other inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would just hesitate I would not add
magnesium unless you have a test showing
[SPEAKER_00]: you need magnesium because it has a lot of
antagonisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you kind of alluded to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to, it's going to typically
raise your pH with most of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to add for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to potentially tighten
soil, not really the same thing in living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, but just something that I want to
caution users about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to add more and you can't
really remove it very effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would add to what you're saying
this to say that I would, I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: probably see excess magnesium five to 10
times more frequently than I see,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, deficiency of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm way more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I recommending growers leach excess
magnesium out of their soil and stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: use of all magnesium inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I am seeing a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I want to add though, Oh,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: With certain led lights, I do see
sometimes seem to see, uh, more magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: hunger in certain cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't found an exact correlation
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I heard that I didn't
believe it, but, um, I'm at the point now
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm starting to see a lot more of
this anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think it's really a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, I see, yeah, I do think
magnesium hunger is quite common visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's why I like that foliar
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I believe that works really,
really well in, in addressing light
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium hunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, the led thing's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I don't have much experience
with that, or I haven't noticed that at
[SPEAKER_01]: least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to, it's good to think about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a spectral thing or maybe
it's related somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has related to
temperature, but those are the only two
[SPEAKER_00]: big differences between.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights and, uh, other light sources is
you get less, uh, leaf, less rays and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature and potentially a
slightly different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure I have more thoughts on
magnesium, but let's, let's move on to
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus in, in living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to get most or all of my
phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ahead of the cycle through dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything's going to bring in
some phosphorus depending on your compost
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to provide quite a bit again,
slowly mineralizing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then otherwise my go-to's are bone
meal and soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to recommend a lot of fish bone
meal, but, um, which has a percent higher
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen than bone meal, much better
micronutrients, but higher sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two and actually a little bit less
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting more sodium,
more micronutrients and more nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_01]: unit of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just go with bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in that, in that sense and,
and heavy metals is also a consideration
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't seen high heavy metal levels
and really any bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to have really sort of luxury
levels of, of organically bound phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in my soil at the time of,
of transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's two sources I can think about
organic sources of liquid phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to feed additional phosphorus,
one is a high phosphorus fish and it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called CFOS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I still don't know how it's
allowed an organic production because
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of stabilizing the fish with
sulfuric acid, they stabilize it with
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that pushes that, that, uh,
phosphorus phosphate number up to seven
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good tool in the
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I can think of,
which is a little bit new, this is another
[SPEAKER_01]: update.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been testing tons of JDOM and KNF
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, for, you know, ferments and,
uh, yeah, primary, I guess primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments, JLF, but just different plant
juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one trend across the board is that
soluble phosphorus is really high in,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, fermented plant juices, which is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it, but it is, it is a use
case for these, um, ferments is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to liberate quite a bit of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the other nutrient levels are,
are somewhat underwhelming once you dilute
[SPEAKER_01]: them to their recommended dilution rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but phosphorus can be, you know,
somewhere like 60 parts per million in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these, um, fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that's sort of
interesting to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen cannabis JLF concentrate that
tests at 27 parts per million of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all of these levels are going to
depend on the nutrient status of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: being used in the ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you diluted that at, let's say one
to 20, you'd have a pretty healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus application that's soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all this can be a little bit of a moot
point in the sense that Taddy's still
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when my internet cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really looking forward to this
discussion and I wanted to share some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my feedback on, uh, ferment tests that
I've gotten back from growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, actually showing pretty high chlorides
and sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, maybe that's something that we can
dive into together in a later conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: or possibly on Instagram live or YouTube
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I'll definitely be following up
with Bryant and I really appreciated this
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
