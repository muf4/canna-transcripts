[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're getting into more of the
realm of anecdotes here, but some growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, there's two things that I've heard
from growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is a myth, in my opinion,
and that's that sulfur levels like that
[SPEAKER_00]: kill soil biology, and I just don't think
there's any evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil microbes need sulfur, and there are
certain populations or certain species
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually prefer high sulfur
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a shift in the population
profile like you will with any management
[SPEAKER_00]: action that you take, but it definitely
doesn't kill microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that comes from the idea that
there are a lot of fungicides in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production that contain sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something called the Bordeaux mixture
or lime sulfur, like it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide when topically applied to the
leaves, but it's in a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry in those products versus sulfur
in the soil, and at 100 ppm, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not caustic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand the functional
mechanism in which it would kill microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you still see microbial action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a microscope, but the microbes
are clearly thriving based on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: other metrics when you use a lot of
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not believe that.
