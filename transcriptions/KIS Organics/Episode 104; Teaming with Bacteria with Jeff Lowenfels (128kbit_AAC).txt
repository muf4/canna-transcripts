[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis cultivation and
science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a science
[SPEAKER_00]: based perspective and drawn top experts
from around the industry to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, I did want to
address one major change to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I mentioned in the past about
adding sponsorships or ads to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've avoided it to date, but with rising
costs and changes to the economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's now something I've had to revisit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, moving forward, there'll be one
to two short ads now at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also be adding the Patreon again
with a subscription based model where for
[SPEAKER_00]: $5 a month, you can get a link to
commercial free version as well as other
[SPEAKER_00]: perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please reach out directly if you have any
questions and I guarantee the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: content will always be free and
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, back to today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get Jeff, our very first
podcast guest and old friend back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is the author of the popular teaming
series, teaming with microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: teaming with nutrients, teaming with
fungi, and now his new book, teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, which he joins us today to
discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has a book called DIY Auto Flower
and Cannabis, which we discussed in an
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is an extremely well respected and
popular national garden writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the former president of the Garden
Riders of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has been a good friend now for over a
decade and is a wonderful advocate for
[SPEAKER_00]: organic gardening, compost teas,
and the microbes in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I am excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I have a relationship with you
and your family and it's always a pleasure
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is your third time now on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of my most frequented guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to talk about your new
book and some of the new research you've
[SPEAKER_00]: come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why don't you take it away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you and I were steeped in
the soil food web and I wrote a book about
[SPEAKER_01]: that called teaming with microbes and that
book came out in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, it was a codification of
what we all learned from Dr. Elaine
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingham, who is, of course, the guru of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, the system, as everybody
probably knows, operates off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates that are produced with
photosynthetic energy by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant designs those exudates,
drips them out into the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they attract bacteria and fungi that
need the carbon that are in those
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, Elaine called them cake and
cookies, you know, sugars, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of carbon in them and that's what
these non-photosynthesizing organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're very happy they're in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are attracted to their own prey
or the things that eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are nematodes and protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the nematodes and protozoa eat the
bacteria and eat the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, they also need carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I need carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, everybody operates
off of carbon, but they don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's in the bacteria or in
the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that excess is plant nutrient and
it's in plant usable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a charge on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes essentially put a charge on
these excess nutrients, I guess we'll call
[SPEAKER_01]: it that, and they're able to move from the
soil into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, teaming with nutrients is a
book I wrote that talks about how that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and how they get in the plant and
what happens inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of a fit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at that time in 2006, I had a
paragraph on mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until I revised the book in
2011 to add a chapter about mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, which are these specialized fungi
that are attracted to the plant by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant signals the mycorrhizal fungi
and it's okay to enter the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does enter the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the root system in the meristem area
and the fungi enters in between the root
[SPEAKER_01]: cells and there's a transfer of exudates
and goodies from the soil by the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a very important addition
to the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out that in 2016,
no, let me go back to 2010, a group in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia and unfortunately, and I'm
really just got to learn how to pronounce
[SPEAKER_01]: this moment's name, a wonderful woman who
has a hyphenated name Scheller Longheim
[SPEAKER_01]: and her team in Australia discovered that
some of these bacteria that are attracted
[SPEAKER_01]: by those exudates to that rhizosphere area
actually enter into the meristem cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this had never really been seen before
or if it had been seen before,
[SPEAKER_01]: the implications of what it was,
was not fully understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this group studied this and they
termed it, I'm gonna give it the American
[SPEAKER_01]: pronunciation, rhizophagy, R-H-I-Z-O,
rhizo of course, meaning root and phagy
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning eating, so root eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it appeared they weren't quite
positive what was going on, that perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell was opening up engulfing bacteria
and then closing up up again and so that
[SPEAKER_01]: was where they were inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't really study about what was
going on and apparently their grant
[SPEAKER_01]: funding must have run out and so it
languished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I remember getting a note from one of
my friends who read about this and I read
[SPEAKER_01]: the note and it just said rhizophagy,
I had no idea what it was until I ran into
[SPEAKER_01]: a gentleman who's a professor at Rutgers
University named Dr. James White.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what got Dr. James White and his
students were able to do, they could trace
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going on with those bacteria,
how they got in, what was happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and what they discovered was beyond
astounding and changes the picture of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web so that if you don't
understand rhizophagy, you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have the full picture of how to operate in
a soil food web situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, how to grow your plants
properly so that you are teaming with the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and the soil food web is helping
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think what I probably should do
with your permission is describe the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we will do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we were doing this, you know,
with a super screen in front of us because
[SPEAKER_01]: the photographs of this cycle are
absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the book, I've got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to find some of these
on the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I begin, I think I wanna point out
that bacteria are something that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're too small to really see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 90 times smaller than our hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just tiny, but they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a consequence, we really,
you know, when I say the word bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: people think of, you know, like a car in a
driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a bacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say bacteria, you should be
thinking of the New York City's biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: airport parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those cars are bacteriums that
form bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should immediately have to listen
to this podcast, Google bacteria head of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see some unbelievable pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just last week, there was an award
given to a picture of a, and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: Google this too, a single tongue cell
surrounded by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will get a feeling for the
tininess and the multitude of these
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms that multiply every 20 minutes
on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a part of the book deals with
bacteria, obviously, and describes them
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they operate and all that kind of
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so now we've got these,
these exudate attracted fungi and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that are up there in the rhizosphere area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these bacteria, instead of
being eaten, they smell a popcorn smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: a buttered popcorn smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same stuff that's in your
stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get too much butyric acid
together, it smells rancid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a tremendous amount of
butyric acid together, it smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: vomit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this stage down at the rhizosphere
level, they smell on butter popcorn in my
[SPEAKER_01]: imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes them because they're living
in a little bacterial slime to think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an area outside of their home
slime that they can move to where they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have a better opportunities to survive to
eat to multiply without having to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the other people on the slime or
other bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they push against the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that what they're doing
is moving through the meristem root
[SPEAKER_01]: meristem cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root meristem cells are very,
they're brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very thin cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very immature cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are invaded by these bacteria who
enter into a space between the cell walls
[SPEAKER_01]: and the membrane that holds the cytoplasm
in the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cytoplasm, the place where all the
organelles are held, the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chloroplast, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I liken this is to a tofu
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a white tofu container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the cell wall of the plant,
meristem cell wall, very thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bacteria go through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they end up in that watery area that's
in a tofu packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called the paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the tofu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them actually enter into the tofu.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the cytoplasm membrane
representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in this paraplasmic space and
the plant goes, Oh, I just got invaded by
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I invited them in,
I need to make sure that they're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to harm me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plant sprays the bacteria with
a superoxide, which is very strong and has
[SPEAKER_01]: the result of stripping off the cell walls
of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are now what we call L-forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the material that was in their cell
walls is absorbed by the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: contains micronutrients, metals,
some really neat things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant uses them as plant
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Internally, they're internal and they're
absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're used internally, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the bacteria goes, Whoa, wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bacteria produces an
antioxidant to reduce the super oxides
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to destroy the cell walls of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this turns out to be nitrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrite is then converted as a result of a
series of chemical reactions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of which involve the plant into
nitrate and the nitrate is plant usable
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's absorbed by the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to 30% of the nitrate of nitrogen that
a plant can receive can be through this
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if that wasn't enough, it turns out
that these little guys, they're breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're multiplying air every 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they multiply, they're also doing
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing a phyto hormone,
a plant hormone that we call ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ethylene causes the Maristan cell to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you have these invading bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They no longer have a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're multiplying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they multiply, they form these
funny little balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like beach balls, volley balls,
soccer balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have four, maybe six wall-less
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stuck together and they're
circulated around this paraplasmic space,
[SPEAKER_01]: producing ethylene, which is also
circulated, causing the Maristan cell to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they get so plentiful that they end
up getting trapped against the cell wall
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant, the Maristan cell wall,
where the ethylene is produced in a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated area because it doesn't get
cycled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ethylene, causes the Maristan
cell wall to form a tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I know this tube to be a hair,
a root hair, but this tube actually begins
[SPEAKER_01]: to fill up with these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they get more and more in the root
grows, you're getting more ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: production and the root hair grows and it
grows longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria are literally expelled by a
paraplasmic liquid tidal wave out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: root hair tip into the soil, where they go
back and they regrow their cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually two, three days later,
go back into a new Maristan cell and
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat the trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not just blown out once.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that root hair grows, there can be four
or five of these explosions of bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that end up back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of which obviously end up getting
eaten and they're, they're part of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to call the, you know, the,
the soil mediated system where they travel
[SPEAKER_01]: into the, but some of them go back and do
the trip again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just simply incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've got essentially,
and I'm going to refine this just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more in a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got is the Dr. Elaine model
that you and I, you know, breastfed on,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can use that term, uh, you know,
that model is a farming model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the plant's a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's throwing out the exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's helping the, the
fertilizing the, the, the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_01]: proto, the protozoan every day and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they end up, you know,
taking in the resultant crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got in this razzle pazzle cycle
is a ranching situation where the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sheep are brought into the barn,
their sheep, reared.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a couple of lamb chops because
what the heck they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then we put them out in the
pasture again to regrow their wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, then that following season,
we take them back in again and we take
[SPEAKER_01]: them off the, off the sheep again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, it's so we've got a ranching
situation and we've got a farming
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, both of which are part of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so now we've got a much more
complete picture of, of how that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: gets its nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's getting 30 or 40% of its
nutrients, uh, from these endo phoenix
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, endo fights, meaning,
uh, that, uh, they live inside the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: for part of their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this is a major, major new discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say it makes teaming with bacteria
equally as important as the original book
[SPEAKER_01]: teaming with microbes, because this is
such an important thing that's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and the implications of it, both in the
future and for right now are stunning and
[SPEAKER_01]: usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll certainly, I'm sure it'd be
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions about me so far,
my stuff so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I've read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, listening to your explanation
right now is actually really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're someone that, uh,
has, has read the book and then listens to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, I think that's actually not a bad
direction to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you break it down, um, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your explanation, I love that analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm going to try and put it into my
own words to simplify it even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please correct me where I screw it up
because I'm still learning and processing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this, uh, myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we have a cycle, uh,
where these bacteria specific bacteria are
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the, the meristematic tissue or
the meristem, which is the, all the new
[SPEAKER_00]: undifferentiated tissue that most people
are familiar with the apical meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have, you know, we're growing
all of our new growth is based around
[SPEAKER_00]: meristimatic tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like really the exciting place on
plants, new root tips, new leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very thin wall, very thin wall because
they're brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're brand new cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they become more specialized,
uh, as, as the plant needs them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they just start as really like a
blank canvas of a cells, how I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of where all the actions
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're adding in this thing we
didn't even know about, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all these bacteria that,
that work their way in lose their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their, their cell wall or their wall,
what you referred to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, while they're inside, they do have a
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose that wall, which is pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I have trouble visualizing this,
but then as they complete that cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're going back out, regaining
that wall and then starting the process
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just want to ask, so then you
mentioned nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you mentioned nitrogen as being the
primary nutrient in this and specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrite converted to nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other nutrients that we know
about that are happening in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, depending on whether it's a gram
positive or a gram negative cell wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: the material that makes those cell walls
is absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so I don't have the list in front
of me, but, but it's, it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: list of things immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are, there are,
they are amino acids and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so there's quite a few nutrients
that are available, uh, by the Razor Fasci
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, which means, you know, I guess
there's really sort of two quick
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you continue, but you know,
why would a bacteria do this and why would
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant let the bacteria do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the bacteria is an enemy
of the plant in many instances,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plant knows that and has defensive
mechanisms to keep bacteria out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That RO in particular can be, can be
strengthened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And incidentally, when it sprayed that RO,
it has the capability of removing its own
[SPEAKER_01]: cell wall, which is very thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has to strengthen itself in
order to be able to handle the Razor Fasci
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that strengthening lasts throughout
the life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the implications is just mind
boggling, but yeah, there's, there,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a series of six, seven,
eight, eight nutrients that actually get,
[SPEAKER_01]: get, get to get into the plant as a result
of the Razor Fasci cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of different strains
of endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just one particular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very important point to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I, if I can just, spend 30 seconds and
explain that there are other kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytic bacteria that enter the plant
through branching in this, in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the root system as a branch is there
little cracks in there and they sneak in,
[SPEAKER_01]: they come in through stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they sneak into wounds and
things like growth holes and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so they, they're in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with regard to cannabis, this is just
too stunning and too amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What some of the studies have shown is
that the mix in the soil of bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: become endophytic in or are capable of
becoming endophytic bacteria, either going
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Razor Fasci cycle or going
into the plant to do other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always basically the same,
but once you get inside the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: categorize the endophytic bacteria that
are in that plant, they differ.
[SPEAKER_01]: From strain to strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the quote terror that we've have
been looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the, you know, the, the,
uh, let's pick a strain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: girl scout cookies has, has one kind of
endophytic bacteria that's different from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, maybe another, another
strain, you know, it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so now we're going to be able to,
be able to start doing some research,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and, and develop strains in different,
different kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really big news for cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and these studies will become
more and more plentiful as president
[SPEAKER_01]: Biden's initiative seeks a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've legalized cannabis world and do the
research that we need to be doing in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the very best of best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these endophytes, when they go in the
plant produce phytohormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got the capability of producing
auctions and doing everything that an
[SPEAKER_01]: auction does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're real auctions or gibberellic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethylene is a, uh, uh, uh, uh,
phytohormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, you've got about six or seven
phytohormones that are produced by these
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and they, they help the plant do
all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other reason why a plant might
let an endophytic bacteria survive in
[SPEAKER_01]: inside itself is because the plant is
getting helped by that endophytic
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, uh, that they're using those
phytohormones again, uh, simply a stunning
[SPEAKER_01]: implication when you consider that all of
what I call, uh, let's just call them the
[SPEAKER_01]: big bad agro guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they studying right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're studying the capability of
bacteria, endophytic bacteria and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and some fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: To produce nitrogen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's, that's what we have in the
rhizophasia cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nitrogen fixation, just like in
rhizobia, although it's not quite the same
[SPEAKER_01]: system, but it's internal nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't this what we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: A wheat plant that's capable of producing
its own nitrogen by hosting right kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what everybody, that's the Holy
grail of agriculture these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is because of the
rhizophasic cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is because of, uh,
this, this, uh, endophytic, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomena that we, that we were stumbling
on and we're beginning to figure out how
[SPEAKER_01]: to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is the bacteria getting the,
the nitrogen in the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pulling it out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but not all of these are, are,
are necessarily, um, rhizobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, that's one of the stunning
things about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so in a rhizobia situation,
what you've got is a bacteria that's
[SPEAKER_01]: attracted literally to a root hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: How interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root hair curls around the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, these bacteria convert themselves into
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of similarity,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they find itself inside the plant in a
different format.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a system whereby the oxygen
level can be reduced, they're capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: producing nitrogen from the air and they
use that nitrogen to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It resides in that nodule.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of it leaks out into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plant dies, that nitrogen is
released back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this situation, you know,
we've got these endophytic bacteria inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant producing nitrogen just from the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you go to cannabis, it becomes
even more interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that paper I sent you this morning by
Dr. James White blew my socks off because
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it proposes a system whereby there's
an explanation for what's going on inside
[SPEAKER_01]: glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything that a cannabis
grower is interested in, it's glandular
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what, what the theory is now,
and incidentally, uh, in the book,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I, I, I alluded to a lot of this
stuff, but the book was written three
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it goes through the editing
process and then the printing,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a while to get a book out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time these papers had not been
completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so I was theorizing what they
would show, but now Dr., uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. White and his students have
demonstrated enough to come up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty solid theory that, that the,
the, there is bacteria in these trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: because originally people were beginning
to think that these trichomes look like
[SPEAKER_01]: root hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't, you know, is there the same
kind of nitrogen fixation activity in them
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is in root hairs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out there's not quite as much,
but there is nitrogen fixation going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, the bacteria that are in these
trichomes, uh, turn out to have to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation where there is a oxygen deprived
situation in order to fix the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what deprives them of oxygen is being
bombarded by, are you ready for this?
Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crow in the, being bombarded onto
these bacteria so that they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: producing nitrogen in, in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what gets produced as a by-product is
what people grow cannabis for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say this is an important book in
terms of its amendment to Dr. Elaine's
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web, uh, uh, you know,
uh, this is also an amendment to anything
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been thinking about with regard to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it goes even further because
the way these bacteria, uh, survive from
[SPEAKER_01]: generational plantations, generation of
plant is through the lead through the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get into the seed situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get into the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they get caught up when this,
when the flower forms, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, turning around around the,
the, the embryo situation and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're inside some of them,
uh, right up by the embryo, some of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably in the embryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. White points out, uh, bunches of them
in the seed coat itself and a bunches of
[SPEAKER_01]: them just inside the seed coat and these
are the bacteria that jump out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you germinate the plant or the seed
and start the process of providing the
[SPEAKER_01]: right rhizophagia and endophytic bacteria
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these years, all so many cannabis
growers have been sterilizing their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, they haven't been
unfortunately able to fully sterilize
[SPEAKER_01]: their seeds because it's not that easy to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but they've been taking some of the
important bacteria out of the system and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, probably wondering why
they're getting powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera, because these
bacteria do all the things that Dr. Elaine
[SPEAKER_01]: explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they produce antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been, uh, you know, all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they go out and create iron and
minerals in the soil and metals and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them into the plant and replant things in
paper towels.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that paper towels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Germination process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my cannabis book, the auto
flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You better be planting that paper towel
piece in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you've got bacteria that jumped off
the seed onto the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, all the advice that you've
gotten over the years about not throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: from me, uh, you know, as a result of what
I'm gleaming from Dr. Elaine, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not throwing away soil unless you've got a
terrible root problem because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: way the soil contains exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it also contains the bacteria that
the cannabis needs and it contains
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the right bacteria for previous
grows, uh, that are, that are either
[SPEAKER_01]: dormant or in there waiting for you to
give them exudates so that they can help
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant become the best cannabis plant
it possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important stuff and it's,
and it's, it, it goes one step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll then I'll stop for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a deep breath in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are chemicals not chemicals,
bacteria that people are now capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that some of the growth stories
are beginning to carry, uh, so terrible of
[SPEAKER_01]: pronouncing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Azospirillium, for example, um,
there are a couple of bacillus that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are using, you know, we already use cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, and the reason we do that is
because they, they fix nitrogen and put
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so all of this ties together,
uh, you know, God bless Dr. Elaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God bless, uh, uh, you know,
uh, Dr. White, cause they really,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really are geniuses for, for
codifying all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this stuff is stuff I invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I do is report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the first thing that comes to mind for
me, and it's a little bit, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes back a little bit to what you're
talking about earlier though is so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the plant, we have all these
endophytes and like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great endophytes and endosymbion,
I guess something that lives within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both, they're both benefiting from
the relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that could be a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it could also be Archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, could be a virus, a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these things inside that are
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not existing in a vacuum
is essentially what you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of what you're talking about
applies to Archaea as well as bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you differentiating between the two or
do they just have very similar functions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to where it's an excellent,
excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I will try to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen any references to Archaea
in this regard, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you separate the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that they clearly have a
cell wall, even though it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the cell wall of a
bacteria, uh, that would contain nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be useful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not, I don't think they
produce nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're capable of nitrogen
fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are part of the process of nitrogen
fixation, uh, in, in, in, in soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to take a look at it and
we'll have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be another book, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you always end up getting excited
and writing another book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like it's only when there's
something, something that comes forward
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, that adds to this thing
that Dr. Lane infected us with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, if you, once you become
a soil food webby, you're stuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because you can't go back,
you know, he can't deny the science that
[SPEAKER_01]: exists out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only improve on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so we've become better and better
at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really something, really something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I started, I started with you
and Dr. Ingham in this sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: journey through meeting you both through
my father, um, as you know, decades ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's really where I began.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this whole idea, you know,
these were your words, like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants putting out all these exudates,
the plant controls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a wonderful, uh, graphic that went
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went with it and you'd have a picture
of a bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, if the plant wants Japanese
food, it would select, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the exudates for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had a picture of some
Japanese people would show up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very entertaining, but it really
like drove that idea home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, it's more what you're
saying now is we still have that process
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have that, the nutrient cycling,
that microbial loop going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of it, we also have these
endophytes, the fungi, the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: the archaea, circling inside the plant,
infecting into the plant and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the way I look at it is
that there's three basic ways that a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: takes its nutrient in via the soil food
web system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and the, the first way is this soil
mediated, uh, movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the stuff is dumped into the
soil and it finds its way into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the second way is the mycorrhizal,
uh, situation, where the mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: takes the nutrients that are in the soil,
sometimes actually converts and then
[SPEAKER_01]: brings them into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third way is this rhesophasty
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there may be fourth and fifth and six
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but so far there are these three ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they are all based on the 2006 model,
which is you've got this pool of bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and fungi that are attracted to the plant
by the exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and it, so they, they just,
they, they fit, um, there could be other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they would, what it
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's also just straight osmosis
where the plant will just take in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the plant mediated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the soil mediated system,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even know if that's the right
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, you, you gotta come up with
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's, it's such new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but again, this is really important
stuff for people to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, and, and it, and it doesn't,
it doesn't change the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still don't rototill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now that when I used to say the
bacteria end up, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in the root zone, end up at the
top or in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, they're all displaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that is same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they're rhesophasty bacteria or
whether they're just rhizophyll bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't rototill, uh, you know,
you compost tea might have a more,
[SPEAKER_01]: a more, uh, ethical, you know,
more, uh, understandable reason for
[SPEAKER_01]: working, uh, in some instances and perhaps
not in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the addition of, uh, the right kind of
mulch in order to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fostering good bacteria, uh, is,
is still in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing, nothing really changes in the
soil food web other than the potential of
[SPEAKER_01]: a future where we can tweak the soil food
web in ways that we're not capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly we're not capable of doing
in 2006 when we barely even, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2006 there were commercial mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are, uh, you know, that's,
that's a heck of a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we have a lot still to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think there's so much we don't
understand about what's going on directly
[SPEAKER_00]: under our feet and that plant soil,
plant microbe interaction, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is I heard a soil scientists years ago
mentioned that, you know, he goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as we know more about what's
going on at the bottom of the ocean and on
[SPEAKER_00]: the moon than we do, you know,
directly under our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just so, it's so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's, so this is where I may
differ a little bit in this because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, we have some camps here around,
you know, soil food web and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: people that believe that, um, it's all
about the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as we're testing the
microbes and, um, taking care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, we're not going to have to deal
with disease or fertility or any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are symptoms of
microbial problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's kind of where I would put
the soil food web camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the other end, you have sort of the
mineral guys, the Albrecht Solomon,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, folks where they're like, you know,
let's focus on minerals, get the minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced into a form that the plants are
going to, uh, have optimal fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all those microbes are just going
to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm kind of like right in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't think either of us
totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add minerals, but then,
you know, all my behaviors are really
[SPEAKER_00]: towards taking care of these, these
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this process, like you mentioned,
you know, limiting tilling, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: reusing soils where we can adding organic
matter in the form of compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think, I mean, I know Albrecht
makes tremendous sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously it's tied to the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because plants, the plants,
uh, need those microbes, uh, to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know what happens when you take the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, in the book, I discussed
this, uh, and Dr. White's shown this a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the bacteria,
you don't get root hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the roots don't grow properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you put the, if you haven't
taken the bacteria out, if you put the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria back, you grow, you grow with
hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is a mineral?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, minerals are micro food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in, in, in the right situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, when Albrecht breaks down,
is when people don't do it properly and
[SPEAKER_01]: the ratios aren't proper, you know,
that's sort of like applying too much
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it, it, it, it, it screws up the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes can't operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that there aren't any microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes that like the fertilizer are
not necessarily the microbes that like the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think I've, there was a big
fight at one point in time because people
[SPEAKER_01]: were yelling at Dr. Elaine Ingham because
she apparently or supposedly, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put words in her mouth,
said that if you've got a good soil food
[SPEAKER_01]: web system, you don't need to add any
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the quote was that all soils
contain adequate minerals for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants or it was something along
those lines.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure whether I, I can,
I'm not sure I can fully comprehend that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the right way to put it,
but there's no question that if you use,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, things that replace these
bacteria, so what they call the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency ratio goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so the natural system seems to be
the most efficient system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, are minerals part of the natural
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether, whether you go with that quote or
don't the minerals that are in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: are helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have those minerals,
it doesn't hurt to put them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sense to me, but that
doesn't mean you, you don't need the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes because you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I, I just wanted to say like,
we know that bio stimulants and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just sort of the industry term that
I hear for adding microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of these, any of these products
that you mentioned that have bacillus or
[SPEAKER_00]: basal spirulium, all of these things,
mycorrhizal fungal, these all be called
[SPEAKER_00]: bio stimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, is one of the fastest growing areas of
sales and research in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not even just specific to cannabis,
just agriculture, which is huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how we grow our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I say the big, I call them the
big evil chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all sending this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be, this stuff replaces
chemicals, uh, because it's natural and it
[SPEAKER_01]: works and you don't have to continue to
apply, you know, I mean, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get there because it just makes so
much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget, no, we don't get, but a lot of
people don't understand that in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the food, the way we grow it now with
combines and chemicals, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, we're destroying our soil
system to the point where, where it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: experts say we got 61.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I don't say 60,
but 61 years of, of harvesting left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well that's because we're not using
bacteria that give the soil structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungited titles, a little aggregate of
slime stuck together, particles together,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, everybody's moving this way and
it's, and it's a good thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we see is by
the, by adding, you know, specific
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, even with so much that we,
we don't know, for example, we see
[SPEAKER_00]: increased growth or disease resistance or
whatever the is associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things are symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even the sum of the parts equal,
equal themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes three plus three equals nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding with the way these microbes
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that being said, are, are all of these
microbes in the, in most soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: or media like would compost contain all of
these for the most part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is an interesting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question because you know,
you know, there, you see these studies
[SPEAKER_01]: that say there are about 650 kinds of
bacteria that are in all soils around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course that's a teeny, teeny,
teeny little number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, the, the, uh, bacteria,
uh, I don't know how to put this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you ask the question again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what I'm getting at is,
uh, cause I, I'd heard a statistic that
[SPEAKER_00]: like 99.98% of the world soil contain the
same bacteria more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're, they're pretty much
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that's the case, why is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially just giving a booster
shot when we add these, and you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: give that particular, uh, strain or
species a, a jumpstart or, or an advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: over other bacteria in the soil that may
be innocuous or disease causing or less
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the way to approach it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you, if you believe that all soils
have the same bacteria, I'm not sure I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that because, because it's obvious
to me that there are, there are bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that we, you know, in the experimentation,
in some of these studies, they're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized bacteria into different kinds
of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why do they have to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, isn't it in the soil already?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see where I'm coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're, they're putting in,
they're looking not, not all bacteria will
[SPEAKER_01]: do the same thing in each, in every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite the same as mycorrhizal
fungi, which for lack of a better term
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to sleep around one, one,
you know, we only can make about eight to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 micro rhizal fungi out of the,
how many 350 that there are, but they,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're able to infect lots of
different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One fungi can affect many different kinds
of plants, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the bacteria, uh, that you've got
to have the right bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what might help a strawberry
plant grow better strawberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bacteria might not do the same thing for
a wheat plant or a apple tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so you've got to find the right
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's probably more than one,
obviously, uh, to, to feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that tends, that tends to point to
me that there are different bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world or different kinds of
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think again about, about what
I, my understanding of how Dr. Elaine
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingham sort of came upon a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she collected soils from plants
that did fabulous around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a banana plant that did
fabulous, the soil from the fabulous,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, this is the ideal kind of soil you
want to have for a banana plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not all banana plants grow the same
around the world, do they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so, so I don't, I don't know
whether I believe that original,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, statement, I guess that's my problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I read it a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, you know, it's, it's,
it's where it's worth looking into because
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I just haven't, I just haven't
done so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it just makes sense to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost look at it like we're,
we're replacing or adding in sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the pro athletes of the microbial world
when we add these bacillus species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they may be out competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we have to be to a certain
extent because we can, we can do research
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows when we, when we work in,
you know, sterile media, and then you add
[SPEAKER_00]: in these specific strains of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get this level of increased plant
growth that we may not see in a control,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could just be, you know,
either a sterile environment or a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of different soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're certainly, we're certainly it goes
against, again, the original statement
[SPEAKER_01]: that the 99% they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it doesn't make any sense to
me unless we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for example, the Alaska humans
that we used to sell, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that stuff was loaded with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you know, of course it also had
different minerals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and frankly, I tend to be more
interested in the soil food website than
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineral side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should spend a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I am familiar with Albrick
and, uh, but, but, you know, we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we tend to be more soil food web and might
have a lot to do with the minerals that
[SPEAKER_01]: supports the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I do know that
individual bacteria are required for
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't all work on the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I kind of feel though that
like they must be everywhere because we
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow plants in a variety of different
conditions and a variety of different soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or soilless media and still have a
thriving plant, um, without trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: select for a particular bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's more about like,
like I think a viral load, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial load in the same sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back to that 650.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's probably a base
that all plants have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that all sales have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other stuff is extra or
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it's just give a little bit
of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to be, it has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to, I just want to throw this out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will get the wrong idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a, I'm not a huge Albrecht guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, I think he, his, his stuff is
really interesting, but I, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fast and true on the mineral
balance side either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't want people thinking
that it would have been interesting had he
[SPEAKER_01]: had, he had some of these microscopes that
Elaine had and that that Kuwait had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a guy incidentally around the
corner from where, from where I stay when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Portland, who has the only
storefront electrical microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in and get things done right
there off the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he has a kind of focal,
uh, uh, microscope as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we can see some of these
rhizophagy bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can meet you in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be incredible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work once we arrange that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, this book is, uh,
you know, I think people need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that it can, it changes the
picture of the soil food web, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is not in any way to denigrate,
you know, our under our, our pre
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizophagy cycle, understanding the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just adds to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't see any detraction from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in fact, as, as I, as I was doing the
research or in all the stuff on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them Cetaphores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never know how to pronounce the word,
uh, these, these wonderful, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that are able to go to,
to put, put out into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to create different metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to bring them into the plant or,
or tie them up so that they can't get in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poison the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the ability of some of these
bacteria, uh, to work with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, fungi and, and, and, and change
nitrogen into a usable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the bacteria themselves,
I'll never believe the five second rule
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's been proven wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I wish it was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pictures of them, but they are,
they're the most incredibly beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and because of the, of the ability
now to use these various microscopy
[SPEAKER_01]: photographing, you know, systems,
holy crows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at a flagella
under, you know, some of these microscopic
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures, I mean, you would swear you're
looking at, uh, you know, the internal
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of an outboard motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, you see the diagrams
of them and I go, wow, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see it in working or when you,
ah, some of this stuff is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, in the black of the book in the
appendix, I, I list a website,
[SPEAKER_01]: which most books never do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to really sort of get the
publisher to allow me to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows this root hair growth,
uh, and the root hair oscillating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can almost see the new molecules
being put into the wall, the root hair as
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just the, the stuff that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see individual at DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, oh my God, it's this stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we live in a terrific world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely different than it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can only imagine, uh, you know,
what's coming up next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you had mentioned now that you have
a new order that you would suggest that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks read, read your series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you, can you touch on what each
book is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give a brief synopsis and then also
in the order that you would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: New readers might tackle them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would obviously start with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start with soil, uh, teeming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it explains the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives soil food web rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it doesn't include the rise of
phagy cycle and it doesn't include more
[SPEAKER_01]: than a paragraph on fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next book I would read would be
teeming with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one that I just wrote, uh,
and it describes the rise of phagy cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: and it describes the role of endophytic
bacteria, the final hormones, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do to plants, uh, and,
and, uh, doesn't have rules, but it does
[SPEAKER_01]: point out some bacteria that work better
with different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then of course there's,
uh, teeming with a fungi, which is about
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycorrhizal fungi, uh, and how they
operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would read the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teeming with nutrients, which explains how
these nutrients get through the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane and what happens to them once
they're inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the, those are the four
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're all available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think Timbers thinking about putting
a set together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I always tell people that again,
this is not stuff I invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't write it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give me the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stuff that Dr. Elaine Ingham,
Dr. James White and other really terrific
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists have put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I do is try to dumb it down so that I
can understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that some of you are a
little bit more intelligent to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dumbed down version works well for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's, there's different
things in each book about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that you want to experiment and try
to find the right answer for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so for example, you asked me about
compost, the difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that are in vermicompost is quite
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite different than thermal compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to be doing experiments on
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since this is a cannabis show,
which one's better, which bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it a mix of the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you want to get the right bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a great research project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's way too complicated
because when you mentioned just
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost, my immediate thought is how
long did the worms process the material?
[SPEAKER_00]: What species of worms did you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what were the temperatures at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the worms fed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could go on and on, but, but,
but when it ends up at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's gone through the worm five
times, generally it has one set of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and same thing with compost,
not the same thing, but I mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, the base again, we, I guess we
ought to always go back to the base is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, uh, for vermicompost, but different
than the base for regular thermal compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say the variability we see in
compost commercially is, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of it's not even compost,
but, um, but much higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but again, it's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Families of bacteria, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and so as a result, you get the,
and that, you know, that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I had trouble with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, we don't study bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We studied dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I was to write a book on
dinosaurs, I could put in scientific names
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of different dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because a lot of the readers have been
learning about dinosaurs from the time
[SPEAKER_01]: they were tending with their plus toys,
you know, all the way through,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, elementary school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they know dinosaurs, but we don't know
bacteria and the names are not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't have, uh, uh,
you know, a common name for every
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it for some, but not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, people shouldn't freak
out by the fact that I list the names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you don't even have to pronounce them
or try to pronounce them by the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: book, you'll know some of them,
but I wanted there to be a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a place where they were listed because we
already have the database of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't have is a home instrument
that tells us what the RNA or DNA is for
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular bacteria that we can match
with that database to tell us what that
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria is, but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the next five or 10 years,
we're going to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be able to point the phone
at a water down sample of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to tell us all of the
bacteria that are in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's, you know, I know we've got the
micro biometer where we can, where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell biomass changes, uh, using our cell
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes so much sense for this to
happen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and you can see a need for it in
a, in a, in a really important way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be excited for where we get a
little more differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that being a very useful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, well, I'm, you know,
I'm not sure we already have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell gram positive from gram
negative, but we don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as gardeners, we don't understand what the
difference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but again, all of these things are
going to become clear and important as
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more people study this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as it becomes clear that
using chemicals is creating a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a bad thing for the global
warming, you know, I mean, there's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: many reasons for studying this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it's just there and they,
and they weren't, they were there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we didn't realize they were there back
in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I just want to mention,
as I'm looking through your, your book
[SPEAKER_00]: here, um, there's a lot more in there in
regards to bacteria than just the rise of
[SPEAKER_00]: the veggie cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you talk about how do bacteria
communicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they move?
[SPEAKER_00]: How, you know, how do they eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get to learn some of those
things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the same thing with the fungi book,
you know, because you've got to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to understand what a fungi is
or what a bacteria is before you can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what a riser or an endophytic
bacteria is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and what I try to do is give
just the amount of stuff you need to put
[SPEAKER_01]: the story together at the right,
you know, it should have, it should have
[SPEAKER_01]: been section one bacteria section two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rizofagy endophytes now that you know,
bacteria is what it is because,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to know a little chemistry
here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, how do bacteria talk to
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they, you know, it's just that they
are fascinating creatures and we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop studying dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to start studying microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ought to start a foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, you know, I ought to have a group
that's anti dinosaur, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we stop wasting our time on
something that's useless and get into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they do have a micro plus stuffed
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beginning to get them,
but, but, but they're not, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to get a couple of books too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of even sort of food web
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but we're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think in schools, the way
dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to touch on because
you you bring up these commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and commercially available
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people get excited for that as
rightly they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've, I've seen research showing the
viability of some of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the regulation I would say on
these sorts of things is all over the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very well regulated because
it's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could be buying something that's
not what the label says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I unfortunately see this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to warn folks on the,
on the flip side of that, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I see cannabis growers, especially
experiment with nutrients all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why we don't consider
doing the same with microbes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: set up an experiment in your environment
with a control and see how your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to adding one thing in this case,
a particular microbe, microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good way to approach
it because there is so much we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many interactions going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think we really have to look at it
in a case by case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there, there's a base that
you, that you want, you know, I tell my
[SPEAKER_01]: clients as a base for living soil,
you want to have a good living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then, then you want to tweak it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, you know, and there are some
products that we know are inherently
[SPEAKER_01]: unreliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean they're bad, they're just
unreliable and you've got to experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and be sure you get the right
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, mycorrhizal fungi is one
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of them don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta, you gotta figure it out and you
gotta figure out how to store them and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to take care of them, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it gets, it gets a little bit more
difficult with bacteria because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: one kind, bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they form a, you know, a dormant
state that you, you can, it has a long
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf life, but most bacteria don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you, how do you know whether
you're buying it alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, so you've got to be very,
very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, and you got to make sure that
you're experimenting yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take someone else's word for it
unless you're awfully good friends with
[SPEAKER_01]: that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've unfortunately tried a lot of these
sorts of products over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not seeing quite the results I want,
but others I've seen amazing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and that's why I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I struggled with that one a little
bit just because I would think if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant disease, it would increase your
biomass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I'd love to know like,
yeah, but you would know that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I mean, I, I've been asked
that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would know that you would see the
plant being sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, you know, if you had,
uh, I don't, I, I will mention a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you had a well-known, uh,
product, uh, that contains phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and bacteria, uh, you can take a test
and know whether it's working or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, obviously if you plant
sick, it doesn't mean you can take all the
[SPEAKER_01]: tests you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a sick plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I mean, I don't buy that argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it's an interesting angle on,
I hadn't really approached it from,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause for me, um, testing biology is,
you know, whether that's sending it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab or, um, you know, the, the biometer,
I guess I'm a little less interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a mineral test because a mineral
test allows me to make like quantifiable
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions, actionable decisions about my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I feel like on the microbe side,
I'm going to do all those things already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you, I'm, I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take care of my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I know it's a little minor point
of difference that we've had for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this before,
but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, but, but it, but, you know,
if people say to me, does this product
[SPEAKER_01]: team with microbes, I can tell them,
uh, I couldn't do it before I had the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, you want that
mineral test as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you've got to have it,
but you don't need to take that mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: test every three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a biometer test every three,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so it's all information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want all the information you can
possibly get into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, you want to know the pH,
which is why it's been added to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you want to know a fungal
bacterial, you know, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: things you want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you try to find it out the best way
you can, but it, but if your plant isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you account for the changes in,
uh, microbial growth just based around
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrology, you know, the water,
the moisture as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, if your plant's not
getting proper water, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow well, but it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, but, but by the same token,
you know, you've got, you've got to just
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be aware of seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biomass in fall is not the same as
biomass in spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so if you're applying something in
the spring to a plant versus, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: fall, you know, the biomass difference is
going to be as your chain or measurement
[SPEAKER_01]: number is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you just have to be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just, I was just thinking I'd want
to control for that variable as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe a day after watering every time
so that I know that, cause I've seen that
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbial communities will change
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that back bacteria can
reproduce in 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have explosions quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as ways to sort of level that out,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think of a compost tea,
you know, I mean, oh my God, the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom you get, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's huge.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I mean, what a wonderful
opportunity to try to be able to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: the kinds of bacteria in various teas,
uh, and there, and, and what they might do
[SPEAKER_01]: to uh, you know, to a plant, not as
opposed to, you know, fertilizer type,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, in other words, not,
not as opposed to creating the mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mediated bacteria, but to see whether
there are any endothelic that end up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's some implications here,
uh, and, and, and research that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought up compost tea,
you know, that's where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I was having, you know,
we all started, we all started with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elaine, you know, she's the guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to, I want to ask you a question
here, your thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I had a recent discussion with
someone who posted an article on compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea that showed, um, basically overall
good disease suppression in a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my sort of initial take is like,
Hey, that's great, but I don't think we
[SPEAKER_00]: can draw any real conclusions because
every batch of compost tea is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batch I make today, the batch you
make, the batch I make five minutes after
[SPEAKER_00]: the first batch I make is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that variability,
I don't feel like I can really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really draw any major conclusions
around other than the fact that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're adding aerobic bacteria if
we're making it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and some you make and some you mix and
maybe and full and some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have, um, you know, uh,
Linda Chalker Scott, who's very anti
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I'm not saying anything that she
would disagree with right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she's kind of built a lot of her
career around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the thing is because she cites
a lot of research showing that compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we could poke holes in that
research just as easily as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like poke holes around the research
this gentleman was showing with disease
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said to me, the issue is
not so much the research itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the inherent variability of these
micros because it's happening on a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so small that we don't understand
that we can't control just because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at such a, such a macro level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's one of those things that
we really can't study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, that's always been the problem
of compost tea is the variability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, and not just the variability
of the compost, but the way the tea was
[SPEAKER_01]: made because they're all made differently
and people put in different amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: different brewers, different, you know,
you've got different temperatures and that
[SPEAKER_01]: level, you know, there's all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's always been a, been a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason why, uh, certainly from
my perspective, I was initially excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about compost tea and I'm still excited
about compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I don't use it very much
anymore because I, I, I've gotten the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that I think I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they came from the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, like you, it's very hard
to prove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, I, you know, I had a backyard
that was so hard paying and I never saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: bird there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a worm anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today as a result of applying compost
tea, holy crow, I mean, the difference is
[SPEAKER_01]: literally night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, and I attribute it to the
application of compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've grown cilantro with and without
compost tea in the same, in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gotten, or, and in, in,
you know, in, uh, uh, non-soil soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pro-lighty type stuff or, or,
or vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I've gotten differences better
with the compost tea than not compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I fully explain it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and there is a dearth of, of,
there, there are a dearth of, or is a
[SPEAKER_01]: dearth of studies that say this is the
greatest substance spice bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, as you say, a lot of it's got
to do with the variability and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you could pick holes through the
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, comparing compost tea,
uh, in plants where you're using compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, that's, that's giving the
plant what the compost tea is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I mean, why is that a good
study?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've got, I've got the same
questions you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what, uh, what I'm looking for in
compost tea is I'm applying a consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to increase my nutrient
cycling, that farmer model that you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and maybe I'm getting some more of
these endophytes in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I'm certainly getting,
you know, an increase in bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we, you can, you can throw
it under a microscope and literally see
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient cycling, um, happen with the,
you know, protozoa running around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ciliates, eating the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, and you can change the dominance
of all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people talk about this,
um, by just brewing longer or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, adding certain food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it can change dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tea at 12 hours is very different than
the tea at 24 hours, even with all other
[SPEAKER_00]: variables the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of trying to study it to me
is just, it's a, it almost feels like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fool's errand to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I think sometimes it's an
attempt to embarrass Dr. Elaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly, you know, uh, but, and,
and, and I wish people would stop doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but, but, but again, uh,
you know, it's the variability is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there, uh, many of us have had some
very interesting, uh, uh, results using
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea, uh, but, but, but some of us
maybe didn't appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, dumping compost tea onto a
plant, you know, depending on how you do
[SPEAKER_01]: it, uh, can, can apply tremendous numbers
of microbes or it can be like putting a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a dropper full of, uh,
of, of compost tea into an ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what impact does it have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also depends on the receiving area
as well as the, the compost tea itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's fraught with bristling
conundrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, at the end of the day to me,
everyone needs to just try their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, try it themselves, see how it works in
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it, for the majority of
people, it's going to, if you're making it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, you know, using good inputs,
you're going to see a positive benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, I don't ever lead with that
assumption or I would never say it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cure your fursarium or keep you from
getting powdery mildew or some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that I've heard around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I are not that far off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how we all kind of fall into
our little spots as we, as we grow and it
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's what's exciting
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adding this, this book, team with
bacteria just brings a whole nother layer
[SPEAKER_00]: into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, I think really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you for, for writing this
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it also, it also explains
some of the reasons why things don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I mean, so, uh, who knew
that you had to have the right kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria to get the fixation that you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, who knew it's now,
now we're getting a little better
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be many other books on this
subject coming, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, and we'll know we're
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we know we're successful with
regard to soil food web stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's what people study now when
they go to college, they study the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: food web, when they study soil science,
you know, and we'll know we're successful
[SPEAKER_01]: when the rhizophagy cycle is part of that
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and when, when, we see it in articles
and et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much time you want to
waste on this stuff, but this year there's
[SPEAKER_01]: been a proliferation of articles about
you, you don't need to rake your leaves in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to me, that's soil food web science
in practical application in everyday life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to rake your leaves because
the microbes will break them down because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: To feed your lawns, to feed your gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, and, and you don't need to
even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to use that polluting,
uh, blower, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is practical application of soil
food web stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you haven't seen those
articles, you will now be aware of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you in the next week or
so, you'll see an associated press article
[SPEAKER_01]: or something as you know, some clickbait
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article about don't rake your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why it's soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of years ago, pre pandemic when,
when Apple came out with the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I think it was the pencil,
the Apple pencil, uh, the iPad that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were using had a soil food web diagram on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, so this is really kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun to watch it all become real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we know it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, we've been thanking Dr.
Elaine and now Dr. James White,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, you know, but now everybody gets
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the leaves things make sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating a natural layer of mulch,
you know, every time the plant drops that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and you remove it, you're removing
nutrients and organic matter from the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that unless you're replacing
it, it's, it's not a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a law of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're violating the law of
return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one place I wouldn't want to do that
is in controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking to cannabis growers
indoors, I would still suggest removing
[SPEAKER_00]: your leaves, um, from the environment from
just from a disease perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, very different,
but I would use them, but I, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would use, yeah, it is very
different, but I would use them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, uh, pile, uh, and then use that
compost in growing that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you could absolutely compost it
thermally composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, that's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I think you could, you can also
vermicompost it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it turns out that vermicompost is
better for your particular strain of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and it may be that vermicompost
is better for all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't remove the disease though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Risk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what doesn't remove the disease
risk to me is anaerobic anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the anaerobic issues
can potentially have the disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but yeah, you put it through a worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it doesn't have the
diseases anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to do some more research on that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to, you know, folks look it up
before you take my word for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been using vermicompost on,
on, on food products and cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably had good starting inputs
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I would be nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you some of the poisons that I cook
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just want to say, Jeff,
it's, it's always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hopefully seeing you
face to face here in the not too distant
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we should definitely, definitely,
you know, this post COVID stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to start having these,
you know, these confabs again,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the cannabis science is
available every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are good conferences where we
can kick some of this stuff around and
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulate other people to do more
research, to improve upon what's already
[SPEAKER_01]: been discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again so much for your
time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this book, I'll have links on the
podcast page for folks that want to check
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope people will go out and read
your book and start doing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want, and if they want to
contact me, I, I, I, I'm a transparency,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Jeff at gardener.com, particularly
interested in hearing about your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if you got questions to ask,
I don't answer immediately always,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but go ahead and I shouldn't say this
on Tad Show because you have so many
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners, but, uh, yeah, you know,
we'll try to answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't know, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have a good rest of the day and,
uh, we'll talk soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say hello to the family.
