[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Chris Castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is the co-founder and CEO of Florin
Flame out of California, currently the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest vertical indoor living soil
cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is a Bay Area native who's been
cultivating cannabis for 17 years with the
[SPEAKER_00]: last six solely in indoor living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Chris, great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met years ago actually at Photo X at a
Fluence conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember, way back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that Chicago or Texas?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Texas, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of lost touch and then
reconnected here in the last couple years,
[SPEAKER_00]: so at the Soil Summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it was great to reconnect and
we've also been working with you guys for
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to work with you guys and it's
been a great relationship that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: building so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Chris, you've built this company,
Florin Flame, which is a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about yourself
and then a little bit about Florin Flame?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a Bay Area native, born and raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you get into cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start real quick there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I got into cultivation,
I think I was 18 or 19, living on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got kicked out of the house for smoking
weed when I was 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, started growing when I was like
18, 19 and then had a break for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got back into cultivation when I was 24,
25 working for other people and then
[SPEAKER_01]: started doing my own thing again with
Florin Flame within the last seven years
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started Florin Flame really from
the ground up, from nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your vision going in to this
project?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was bartending.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, this was like 2016 and I knew
cannabis was going legal in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to take a bet on myself and I
pitched an idea to do a small license grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in Richmond or Oakland, like a 20 or 50
lighter or something, something very
[SPEAKER_01]: modest to an investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that we wanted to do soil,
style cultivation because I knew that was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lead to better quality product
just from personal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything about living soil
at the time or any of these terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I pitched this idea to a real
estate investor and broker and he's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: friend and mentor as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the vision to want to take this
project to the next level, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the course of, I don't know,
six months or so, we were looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: different properties for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came across this building in Oakland
that was on the outside of the green zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as Peter, the owner, as soon as he
saw the building, he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had this vision in his head to do this
huge build out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of how he thinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember over the course of the
development of the project where I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: him and I was like, are you sure you want
to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the build out just kept getting
bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the way he thought and he
wanted to stick with it and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found it really exciting and
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he anticipated what a
challenge it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially post construction, which I
always told him, I'm like, the real work
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to begin when we're actually have
plants in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's a lot of work with
research and development and architectural
[SPEAKER_01]: and the construction phase and startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, yeah, the real work begins
when you when you get plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: building.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and then the name Flora and
Flame that was founded by my fiance,
[SPEAKER_01]: she kind of came up with the name when we
were brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the name was conceptualized in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started off with a very small,
we called it like our trap lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, but it was this illicit
facility that we set up where we had where
[SPEAKER_01]: we were testing different LEDs and KNF and
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And learning all these different terms and
taking courses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really kind of where we cut our
teeth and figured out how we were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: scale up what we were doing to what you
see now with 400 plus lights and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: like 8500 square feet in our state of the
art facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to ask you some questions about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to let listeners know we
are going to be talking about this from a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial perspective here at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do plan on getting some information
from Chris about how he would approach
[SPEAKER_00]: home grows too, because I know there's a
lot of people that listen that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure the information
applies to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can stick around through the
commercial stuff in the vertical talk that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do about growing vertical,
then we'll get back into the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all applicable cultivation information
that really goes whether you have five
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or 5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk a little bit more about
what you're calling this trap room or trap
[SPEAKER_00]: facility at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the lessons that you
learned in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just kind of threw out a bunch
of terms of things that you tried out like
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF and living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were your experiences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it was about we had six lights,
three four by eight beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the four by eights were initially
really shallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like maybe four or five inches of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not a lot of soil depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a gas station property that
we we modified to to this to build out
[SPEAKER_01]: this grow essentially for us to figure out
what we were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the course of three years,
we were working on and when I say we,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was me and my colleague, Alex,
who still works with us at Floor and
[SPEAKER_01]: Flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked with Alex at another grow,
you know, 10 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really him and I that developed our
SOPs, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually built our own soil mix
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't even remember where we
first heard about KNF initially,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I remember we took an import in-person
like crash course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drove up to, you know, somewhere in
Humboldt up in our near Arcata.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy, a world's last hope was his
Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of the so he was one of the
few people, you know, basically talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about KNF and ferments and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember going to the class and he
was passing around the FPGA and having
[SPEAKER_01]: people drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was just fascinating at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's like a kombucha or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, semi quasi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was just fascinating learning
or hearing all these different terms and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how there was different methodology
of living soil, if you will, or soilless
[SPEAKER_01]: media indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we took that crash course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even bought, you know, chose book and me
and Alex, we made all these ferments and
[SPEAKER_01]: did all these recipes and we applied them
at our little lab that we had and
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just unbelievable trichome
coverage and beautiful structured flour
[SPEAKER_01]: and flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feedback that we were getting from
people on that first run was just
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh, OK, we're like really
onto something with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had its challenges to indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I had so little experience
with it, but we saw that it increased pest
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure indoors, was causing other
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were concerned with using those
methods in a licensed market where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to go through lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were worried about microbials or
other failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, keep in mind, this was like
2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see people in today's market using
KNF like Moon Valley that are able to pass
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we've learned a lot since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, we moved away from KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we pivoted was,
you know, concern for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I went to a soil conference down
in Santa Barbara and heard Steve Cantwell
[SPEAKER_01]: speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this was like 2017 or 18 and
was completely blown away by what he was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In indoors in a licensed market with
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, I could relate to him and his
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I introduced myself and kind of helped
me along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that timing, I was able to
take a soil food web course with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was she had her last in-person course
that she taught at this ashram in Castro
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a week long where we.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was just a crash course of,
you know, her talking every day for eight
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building compost piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was another like just huge eye
opening experience for me, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we use a lot of those methods,
but indoors, it's different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I use a microscope, but maybe not to
the extent that some other soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasts use because I don't think it's
quite that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've mentioned that,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not a necessity to use a
microscope to do living soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I have my microscope
literally right next to me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't use it in most cases for
making any actionable decisions in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of my soil or fertility management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I I think I've shared my opinion on
here already about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to just say that Steve has been
such a wonderful representative and voice
[SPEAKER_00]: for the living soil community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really done an amazing job of
straddling, you know, the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between folks that are in the soil food
web or K&F or soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been so open minded and accepting and
just a really great person to really show
[SPEAKER_00]: what what the potential of this
methodology really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm honored to consider him a colleague
and friend and and know him and have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: his property like his farm is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, shout out to Steve for just
really doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the person that he is a fantastic
person and friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I definitely feel lucky to to
know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what it's it's a huge testament
as far as how big of an influence he is to
[SPEAKER_01]: the living soil community just based off
of how good of a person he is and how open
[SPEAKER_01]: minded he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's the thing that him and I
have talked about, like he may not agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with everything I say, but he says he'll
listen to it because if he can't come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a good argument against why I might
be saying something, then he's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try it out or he's probably going
to adapt it, you know, and or adopt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same the same thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't necessarily agree with all of
the things that he does in his facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them to me seem like an IPM risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about this actually on
the podcast even.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, like he pulls it off
very successfully and he's very thoughtful
[SPEAKER_00]: about how he does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not just, you know, scattering
cover crops and he's not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doing the things that he does
without putting a lot of thought into why
[SPEAKER_00]: he does them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the most important part
of all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's let's get back into your build
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a very tall building that kind
of it's if I'm remembering correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of forced you into going more
vertical and doing a tiered grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember when we started the like
architectural rough architectural phase of
[SPEAKER_01]: the project, we were just trying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so people can picture we bought this
building, the properties 50 feet wide by I
[SPEAKER_01]: think 110 feet long, big open inside,
28 feet tall inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just trying to figure out how
to design the facility and fit all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different, you know, processes that we
need to fit within that space,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, drying, trimming,
curing, just everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially, I remember we were we were
just trying to fill how much how much how
[SPEAKER_01]: much flower space could we fit in this in
this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how little we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just trying to fill it out with
with just flowering and lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering rooms and lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we figured out we needed to build
up to fit just everything we needed to do
[SPEAKER_01]: from veg to curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I remember I we came across
a bad advisor, but not all it was not all
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, but he was familiar with vertical
farming through a farm actually out in
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada as well called the Grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard of them,
but they were a two tiered they were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in soil and auto pots,
but they were a two tiered LED grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of Las Vegas or in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he advised us to look into vertical
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eventually got rid of that advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was introduced to Michael Williamson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he works he's worth PIP now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he he cut his teeth in the industry
doing managing big grows like big outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grows as well as vertical farms and
helping people set up their facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was introduced to him through Fluence
and he really helped us out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility design and layout because I just
I've never managed a facility that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to make sure that we were going
to get the dry room sizes right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg room, the mother space,
all that the equipment selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was huge in helping us develop those
vertical farming SOPs and just helping us
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping our head around vertical farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really we came across or we needed to
do vertical farming just purely out of
[SPEAKER_01]: necessity of being in a urban dense
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could only build up and we had to
fit everything that we needed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was purely out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you brought up a good point in
terms of facility design.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other aspects that need
to come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't even talked about like HVAC
and and electrical and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just even like I know with your
facility having places to stage material
[SPEAKER_00]: was in something that you had to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like a facility to have a
quarantine or R&D space, because at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time, if you're bringing in new
genetics, you don't want to bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be nice to have a space where you can
grow them for a month or two and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're truly clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's separate from everything else
before they actually go into your
[SPEAKER_00]: production portion of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of before we get into the
vertical aspects, what do you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys really nailed with this build
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of considerations and what things
do you wish in retrospect you'd done
[SPEAKER_00]: differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think overall, because it's a
purpose ground up facility, it's truly
[SPEAKER_01]: state of the art and one of a kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of things we did
do right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think HVAC equipment selection,
our environmental controls and sensors and
[SPEAKER_01]: just the layout and design overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's working as far as things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch on that really quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what brands are using even for HVAC
and some of the things there that were
[SPEAKER_00]: really because you are state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe some of the things that
you guys have in your facility that most
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities may not have or even be aware
of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for HVAC equipment, we went with a
company called Cultiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember who's their main bandit
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Trane or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are specifically designed
packaged units that are meant to
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidify first and then cool second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, I think, well over 200 tons of
AC just on our roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our environmental control system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use all industrial grade sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole system was custom
designed with myself and David Lubuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was formerly of Grow Remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Grow Remote is the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: David doesn't work with them anymore just
because they've had to shrink their staff
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we did a custom catered built
design with the environmental control
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was me and David working on every
aspect of that from water irrigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: our reverse osmosis, condensate reclaim,
what types of sensors, placement of
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just basically everything from start
to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, yeah, our equipment and then
our environmental control system are like
[SPEAKER_01]: the two main things that make us stand out
from other facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember in your talk, there was
something related to airflow that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wished you had done a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In at least one of the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you go into that really quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so five, six years ago, we just
didn't know what we know now in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical farming and HVAC airflow room
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our design, we have the supplies at
the top of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have one return per room kind of on
the ground level tucked away in one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that we've learned a lot,
ideally, you want the supplies on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground on one end of the room on floor
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the opposite end of the room
towards the top of the room is where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want your returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to pull that cool air
completely through your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as inner canopy airflow
design, we've tried duck socks and
[SPEAKER_01]: oversized fans that are pushing large CFM.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in a 40 foot row, which is the
length of our rows in most of our rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, you would want to be running
fans from either staggered on opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: ends of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you would want them in the same row
facing each other, because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have enough CFMs to push that
entire 40 feet, no matter what you think
[SPEAKER_01]: with the duck sock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually just went back to
oscillating fans for the inner canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow, because that just works better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the space of our tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the fact that we're doing
living soil in these beds and how much
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture that's perspiring into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be a number of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found that our airflow and humidity
is lower, obviously, on the top tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's easier to control than the inner
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to achieve inner
canopy airflow without just the right
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment or design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in my home grow, I'm doing a poor
man's version of duck socks, essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can't get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a certain commercial
scale to make it even worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not buying 10 feet of them,
for example, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used greenhouse convection tubing
that had pre-punched holes in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked that up to a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been pretty happy with that in
terms of the airflow that I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been kind of a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to check it out,
I've put it up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be starting another cycle here
now that I'm home from the Soil Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the HVAC, is there anything
that you would have done differently in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the build itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we would have gotten,
well, one, also reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have gotten reheat in the HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a big difference in preventing
temperature swings during the lights off
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have gotten better drain placement
as well in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would have helped more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty happy with their build out and
design, but those are like the few things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would have done differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your current drains in the rooms
and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you move them to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, and this is partly pushback
from the owner too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough balance with a big project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your needs across and then also
making that argument with the owner or
[SPEAKER_01]: contractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was kind of against getting any
floor drains of any kind in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just have small corner drains maybe
one or two in each of the flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would have done, I can't remember
the style of the drain, but I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten more of a continuous run in the
front of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a bigger drain to clean your
floors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also has its challenges because you
have to keep that drain constantly clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it just would have helped with
just cleaning more with better drain
[SPEAKER_01]: placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really even lucky to have drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, a lot of facilities work
with don't have drains and then trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: retrofit that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to the vertical farming
aspect, are there any tips or pointers for
[SPEAKER_00]: going vertical?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you and I talked ahead of time that
you would not have you would not in
[SPEAKER_00]: retrospect go vertical if you weren't
forced to based on your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the what are the challenges?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes it takes longer to do certain
tasks because we're we're utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: scissor lifts to work on the second tier
just because it's it's safer than maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: putting up some type of temporary catwalk
system or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we use scissor lifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tasks take longer in that respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of a learning curve
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just getting getting the team to to
check out the second tier enough to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that it's getting adequately watered,
scouting for pest pressure, stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easier to manage stuff that's on
the ground floor because we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: walking on it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much harder to get your team even two
days a week to spend all day up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: second tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're just making sure everything's
getting taken care of because because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the style of growing that we're doing,
we have to give these plants that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to make sure that we're we're
getting boutique quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's just impossible to compete
in the established, you know, California
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, just workflow tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would I mean, I wouldn't do it if
you don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's that would be a big tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gosh, yeah, just making the time and
scheduling appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've noticed on the second tier with
airflow, the beds can get more of a dry
[SPEAKER_01]: back or just less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to make sure they're
getting watered adequately and the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity is just a little bit lower,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that and I would grow strains that are
easier to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strains that, you know, that trellis
easy or you don't have to thin out as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just less canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would want to put those on on your
second tier or third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one would be if you had to
guess at a percentage of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much more time would you say that
second tier costs you because you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize scissorless?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just harder to get to and access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we probably have versus like
another grow that wasn't growing
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably have to have two to three more
staff, full time staff than what a non
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical grow would need just just for
that extra time needing to spend on on
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you had a task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you had a task like, let's just
say like defoliating, how long if it were
[SPEAKER_00]: to take you, I don't know, half a day to
do the lower tier, how long would you
[SPEAKER_00]: budget for that upper tier sort of a
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it would take, you know,
three quarters of a day or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what we would do in that instance,
we would try to get at least two
[SPEAKER_01]: scissorless in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're having two people in each lift,
maybe working on opposite sides of of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other or in that same row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it might add an extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two to four hours, depending on
what the task is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of an issue is stuff dropping
down onto that lower canopy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants down below with disturbance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or dust or or leaf matter when you are
defaulting, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an issue at all for you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get some when you're
de-leafing, you get some leaves that drop
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just having to go through the bottom
canopy and just grabbing those,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that they're not stuck in that
canopy on the bottom tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess another point I should have
brought up as far as things or tips for
[SPEAKER_01]: people with vertical grow or things we
would have done differently is drainage
[SPEAKER_01]: for runoff on your second tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we accounted for it, but we didn't
account for cracked trays because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: weight of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that was probably the biggest
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you do have drainage for
runoff, we would still get some cracks in
[SPEAKER_01]: those trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get sometimes if there's too much
runoff, which obviously we try to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the blue mats, sometimes floods
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had to hang like five gallon
construction buckets under those points
[SPEAKER_01]: where the tray might be cracked just to
capture any possible runoff to prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: that from dripping onto the plants on the
bottom tier or dripping onto the lights or
[SPEAKER_01]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, the plants,
because if you're getting that runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: water on those plants, you might run into
botrytis or some kind of fungal issue
[SPEAKER_01]: later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's touch on that for people,
because how I know someone had asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how deep are your beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours are at least 14 inches now.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they're about 14 inches deep.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and I'll shoot ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question just based on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are you in four by four beds,
four by eight beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the length or by the sizes of
your beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question I have, because I'm
always trying to talk people into four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four beds over a four by eight bed,
because I think it gives you one more
[SPEAKER_00]: replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a better it's a smaller data point
and or end value, higher end value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, if you have an issue like a
cracked tray, maybe you could only remove
[SPEAKER_00]: a half yard of soil instead of a full
yard, assuming a 10 inch depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd actually have more than that
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there any advantages to a four by
eight other than a slight savings in cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I put too much thought
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest difference between
like a four by four and a four by eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you said, it would be like costs like,
you know, you might be spending more on
[SPEAKER_01]: components for your irrigation system in a
four by four versus a four by eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe more points of failure or you're
just needing more parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just felt like a four by eight
was was the right move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case there was an issue,
I felt like it would be easier to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, whether it's like a pathogen or
some kind of pest in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a root feeding nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it would just be excuse
me, just more costs from for more parts
[SPEAKER_01]: for like irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely like a smaller,
like you said, a four by eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: even I don't want a 40 foot row of soil if
I can avoid it just because if you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue like a pathogen or something,
let's say the fertility gets wacky in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bed, you can always just pull out a
smaller section of soil if you ever did
[SPEAKER_00]: have to replace something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of future proofing
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's let's start talking about blue
mats because the design that we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mats that we've come up with is a
four by four design that's modular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be the same for me in a four
by four as you know, we just double it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a four by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of parts wouldn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is I know you use blue mats as well
because I saw your presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is what what is your design look like
for blue mats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start there and then we'll talk
about your overall feelings about blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats, pros and cons for people who haven't
haven't considered them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done all kinds of different
layouts with blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using them or working with them
for at least six years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we started off with like the
the drip, not the drip tape, but like the
[SPEAKER_01]: the little drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use two different carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a six inch and a nine inch at
different points in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried the blue soap tape in a variety
of different layouts currently or what we
[SPEAKER_01]: did initially with the setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I think we started with six inch
carrots and then we kind of did like
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a figure eight type design
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we moved to a nine inch carrot
and kind of modified the tape so it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be touching the corners and the sides a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently, Cooper from Blue Mat,
he stopped by with their new design,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is using blue soap tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's four rows of it running the length of
the bed from corner to corner with a one
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure reducer manifold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's at like 10 psi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That design has been working great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the new layout and design that they
came up with, I don't know if you were a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that at all, but that that worked
out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to see that room working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might fluctuate on the side of
overwatered versus under watered,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'd rather be over watered in living
soil than under watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, it's it's been a
challenge, though, with the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need we can't hand water all of our
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just we have six flowering rooms,
eighty five hundred square feet of canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, the two tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I needed the blue mats to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've worked overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you know, just to be frank,
I've also banged my head against the wall
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with these because it's you know,
we go in into rooms where there's floods
[SPEAKER_01]: and water on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm having to pay staff to,
you know, shop vac water for three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours or drain the the lines underneath
the trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drain line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's been a challenge,
but also I'm trying to work with them
[SPEAKER_01]: because I need this to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen good results with it,
too, where we've hit really good metrics
[SPEAKER_01]: in living soil with with some of the
cultivars were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, some good, some good and some
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the direction that they're
heading in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spend more money,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already spent enough money you know,
installing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's my only complaint with the
new manifold design is that all those
[SPEAKER_00]: parts and pieces are more expensive and
they're also potential fail points.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I think I think it's a
perfectly good design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use we use with blue mats when we
recommend we use kind of a spiral similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to your S design, but just more of a
spiral.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the I like the shorter carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read the depth a little shorter,
a little shallower than the maxi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'd be interesting to do to A.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: test this because I haven't I haven't done
that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought I think your review of blue
mats is very, very honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think folks going into them should
realize that there's a learning curve and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also every irrigation system has the
has the potential for leading leaks and
[SPEAKER_00]: floods and these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no perfect solution out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only upgrade I would consider would be
a commercial system like something from
[SPEAKER_00]: DRAM where you have, you know,
a very industrial built in tensiometer
[SPEAKER_00]: that's reading the moisture content in the
bed and then irrigating that bed
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to what the blue mats do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would require electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be it's very expensive compared
to the cost of entry the blue mats offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you have the budget to really
go, you know, all in on irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: management, I think the blue mats are a
very good entry level solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities or even for home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set them up for my next run
at my house here that are that make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I think I think you're you're
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's blue mat is great for home
growers and it could be great for a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial setup too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's there's definitely a huge
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always making improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their SOP that they've developed
with the Haining drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but also we're looking into
implementing a different style of
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation in one of our rooms,
too, because something similar to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: just described, because we already have
that capability with our environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: control system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it would probably be pretty
cheap to set up in one of our rooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: get something like that going because we
already have the infrastructure in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to look into that when we
get some more money and can afford to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have to give credit to the guys
over at Sustainable Village for really
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing to innovate with the product
and come up with new solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and I really like I really like
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also sell blue mats like they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have a slightly different design
philosophy, but it's very close and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think either system would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about soil and fertility
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you started with KNF and had
good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know any of that part of your
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't meet you until I really connect
with you on soil management until much
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what did it look like when you first
opened the facility then?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how did you get to where you are
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the last year has been huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just learning a lot about soil
fertility, especially living soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: soilless media indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize the challenges as far as
making sure that that soil remains fertile
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're trying to get four and a
half turns a year per room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as idealistic as one might
think with living soil indoors and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to be sustainable and yeah, so we started
off with fully charged soil from a
[SPEAKER_01]: well-known soil company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had, you know, really good results,
good yields at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, gosh, I'm just trying to think
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were mulching at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some cover cropping, Diacondra,
mustard, barley, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, learned a lot about
companion planting and cover cropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What not to do, what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of lean more with where you stand
on companion planting indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it can be more of a problem than
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think no matter what you're going to
attract pests, even with Diacondra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could be good or utilized to
maybe to capture pests, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: banker system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we primarily rely on a mulch layer to
keep our rhizosphere going and keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes and fungi alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see better results with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've ran into pill bug issues like Steve
has talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've definitely moved away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned a lot about making sure to
test all of your inputs in your soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're sourcing your soil because
you don't want to contribute to heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals because of, you know, how good a
bioaccumulator cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll pick that up no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had to deal with heavy metal
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to some inputs in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've thrown the kitchen sink at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried manipulating pH, adding
biochar, pulling soil out, adding new soil
[SPEAKER_01]: in, utilizing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've planted hemp before we planted
cannabis to try to get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a variety of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience with heavy metal is there's
literally nothing you can do unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to replace the soil or after so many
rounds of just pulling it out naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've had some challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we've had plenty of rooms that
have passed just fine and where we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: had to deal with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but soil fertility overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned not that we weren't testing
our soil before, but I've just come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: realization how important it is to test
your soil at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we test, we kind of follow your guys'
SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for the audience, we work very
closely with Tad and his team,
[SPEAKER_01]: with Brandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We submit a soil sample around after eight
weeks in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of getting the same snapshot
in time of where rooms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to take different points in the
room just to try to get a general idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go off of Brandon's
recommendations or working with them being
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, we need to get our yields up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we bump X, Y or Z up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's super critical,
especially in a commercial setting where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to hit certain metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be doing soil testing and you
need to be making sure that the input that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using are clean and tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mentioned this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we harvest a plant, we're pulling out
organic matter and we're pulling out
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things need to be replaced every
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we take that into
account when we're thinking about harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, also to clarify for listeners,
you originally did not have our soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't contributing to your heavy
metal issues when you were dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: that in case anyone was listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been pretty successful at sort of
mitigating heavy metals, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are all the challenges that you
listed in terms of understanding your
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs and knowing that tests can be
manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to do your own testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that you and I talked about
off air beforehand was I had done some
[SPEAKER_00]: testing with a lab that was using XRF
technology instead of ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't I did not fully understand
it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did not realize was that the
detection limits for that technology were
[SPEAKER_00]: not stringent enough to give me the
information that I needed to make a good
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, and I'm going to make up
some numbers here, but they'll be close.
[SPEAKER_00]: For arsenic, it might not detect anything
under 6 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll give back a non-detectable level
as an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for lead, it might be 10 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it comes back non-detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had 9 ppm of lead and 5 ppm of
arsenic in that soil or in that product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would come back non-detectable as if it
was not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those levels are just frankly too high
in a regulatory market to feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to understand the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just throw out as a guide,
don't trust test you see on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: to necessarily reflect what's in the
actual product that you're receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just some advice for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to add anything to that,
Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's fantastic points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to understand the method of
testing or the equipment that you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: and making sure that it's accurate enough
so you can feel comfortable with the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision that you're making, making sure
that the soil or inputs you're using are
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to add on, yeah, you can't take
what someone posts on social media is just
[SPEAKER_01]: truth or accurate when it comes to
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Tad said, you have to do your own
testing in due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got a program that seems to
be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some of our soil in the facility
now, but not exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like you've figured out how
to manage and pass successfully now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because California has very tight
regulations around heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are looking up and much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're happy to be working with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are providing all the soil for
our veg and mom program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that soil is getting put back into our
flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using other inputs that you
provide as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, things have been great,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, lots of learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, it's like we have to hit
certain metrics because it is a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to make sure that there is
enough fertility in that soil to hit those
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just different in a soil-less
media setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding any nutrients mid-cycle,
any teas, KNF?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferments, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know the answer to a lot
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we try to do low, low-cost input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely utilize compost extracts
and teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's compost sourced from catalyst
bioamendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their material is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do some soil drenches,
some foiler feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's like a cost perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're doing soil drenches with
all kinds of biostimulants, or you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to add potassium or calcium or
humic or fulvic or aloe or coconut or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it may be, well, that costs a lot
the more you're scaling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to do at least one or two
drenches of some of those things I just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost, teas, and extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep it really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: After hearing Eli speak at the Soil Summit
and what he's doing with KNF and fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: plant juices, I am going to be looking
back into that because he has been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: testing on his input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be looking into different
fermented plant juices as like a potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: source or just a good sugar source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's always good to get sugars
into your living soil system because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that makes a big difference in your
end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing all these little things,
it definitely adds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how much of a better
product you end up getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, I've heard really great
stuff about the cannabis you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing from Nelson over at Poetry
Plants and then in-house with Brandon
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson, our in-house agronomist grower
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to you guys for producing a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I just want to mention when
you mentioned the fermented plant juices
[SPEAKER_00]: for folks, you can absolutely make those
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of information on how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily need to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do go down that route, keep an eye
on sodium and chlorides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two things that I would want to
test because I've been seeing a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium and chlorides on my test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are two things that you want to
keep low on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compost is probably the biggest source
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly water if we talk about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have seen pretty high sodium and
chloride levels in some commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: produced FPJs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep an eye on it and make sure if
you are adding it because that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to impact your soil long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may require flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or leaching out of your beds at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I enjoyed Eli's talk too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing about how people are successfully
using these techniques to save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you're trading labor for
money at that point because you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: making your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that makes sense, then I fully
support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places you just don't have time to do
that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it can produce a very high
quality flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, a couple last questions for you,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at this from a home grow
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure cultivating commercially has
changed your views on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what principles would you apply if you
were setting up a home grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's sort of the same and what's
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot would be the same in terms of
just moisture, water management.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the number one thing I'm
looking at is making sure that the soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: adequately watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not under watered or over
watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say 90% of growers probably over
water or new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as what would be
different, it would be my ability just to
[SPEAKER_01]: give more attention to less plants or just
a smaller grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, you can do a lot of the
smaller things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, you can do a lot of
these inputs of humic, fulvic every other
[SPEAKER_01]: day, even if it's just a light drench or
your FPJ or your aloe, your coconut,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a period of a flowering cycle,
it's going to make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think what we're doing,
we are producing some of the cleanest and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best flower in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know that a small home grow or
like a six lighter or 10 lighter,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have better batches and
probably slightly better flower than us
[SPEAKER_01]: just because they can give it that much
more attention or they're just giving
[SPEAKER_01]: those inputs over a period of that
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's certain measurements or things
maybe we can't measure yet as far as what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes a living soil or soilless media
product better than a synthetically grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people say, well,
the plant doesn't know the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between a carbon based nutrient or
amendment than versus a synthetic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that may be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's happening with that microbial
or fungal life that's leading to a
[SPEAKER_01]: superior product?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't say THC percentage or
even terpings necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's other factors or variables
that we're not able to measure yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's just interesting to think
about, too, like what what is going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like you see with hash
competitions or even flower competitions
[SPEAKER_01]: and the people that win those,
it's it's usually living soil growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you essentially said a lot of
what Brian Mason, soil doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: says in regards to cultivation and this
idea that if we can just keep feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: small amounts of carbon to our plants,
which is what a lot of most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments and teas are, are just little
bits of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're we're creating an optimal
environment for soil health and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I feel like you really nailed it
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, is there anything else you'd like to
share regarding from a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll let you answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have one last thing for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one thing I've noticed with PPFD
and light intensity with LEDs in a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: setup, when you're able to do those small
inputs over the course of that flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: period, I was able to increase my PPFD
much more than in a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's based off of like
what's actually available for the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in our commercial setting,
we're relying on that macro micro and
[SPEAKER_01]: macro life to kind of break down what
we're putting in to make it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with those small inputs on a
smaller scale, I think those inputs are
[SPEAKER_01]: available more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a different perspective
when driving PPFD in a smaller setting
[SPEAKER_01]: versus a commercial setting, at least in
my experience with living soil or soilless
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the facility currently,
I'm not going to push more than 800 or 900
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's even with 1200 ppm CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just noticed a lot of strains can't
take that much PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our R&D facility, I was able to
push anywhere from 1200 to 1500 PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: without seeing any negative drawbacks or
negative effects on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were doing a lot more applications
of fertility applications too at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the KNF stuff and other T's,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume you're supplementing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think of PPFD, I immediately go
to CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume you were also
supplementing CO2 in the other facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a home grow, if you're not
supplementing CO2, I would not play around
[SPEAKER_00]: with levels over 800 or 900.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant just can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's just no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then, last thing, floor and flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys have a fun slogan,
sort of a company mission that you put on
[SPEAKER_00]: your containers, your packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to share that with folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we came up with this phrase when we
were going through our rebranding,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I regret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually going back to our old
logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we came up with this great phrase that
kind of represents who we are as a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: and a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that phrase is a small batch indoor
flower grown with love in living soil by
[SPEAKER_01]: humans who give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't have started this brand if,
one, I wasn't a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, if I didn't believe in the
medicinal qualities of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to produce a product that not only
that I consume myself on the daily,
[SPEAKER_01]: but something that I can stand behind and
be proud and want to share with people to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's a great slogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people, we're the largest vertical
indoor living soil farm currently in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, we're only a small mom and pop
owned facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only 8,500 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're this big, you know,
conglomerate glass house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's our phrase or slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope folks in the Bay Area will
try it out if they're ever visiting or
[SPEAKER_00]: something when they go to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate you sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was the one thing about the
Sol Samba that I really appreciated is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we might have slight
differences in how we cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, we're all trying to
push what we think is most sustainable or
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative and environmentally friendly
and appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a cool community of folks
that fall into this sort of living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: camp for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like we said, we believe in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think this is the most sustainable
way to cultivate indoors and the most
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative way to cultivate outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a good rest of your day
and thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the audience could get something
from our talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was a pleasure being on and I
continue to look forward to growing our
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship and working with you guys as
we grow too.
