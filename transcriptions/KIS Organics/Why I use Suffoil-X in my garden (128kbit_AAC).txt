[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do a follow-up post from last
week talking about SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got these plants in at the
beginning of the cycle, they actually came
[SPEAKER_00]: in with thrips and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to do something to treat
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good idea anyway,
even if you don't have any pests that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know about, just as a preventative,
because a lot of times you can't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, I used SufoilX and I
applied it three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple days apart to help break the
insect life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I followed that up with some
beneficial insects and beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk a little bit about why I
choose to use this product in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and foremost, I just want to say
I'm not sponsored by these companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: by SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes recommended to me by a good
friend of mine, Suzanne Wainwright-Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the entomologist when it comes to
the canvas industry and other
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should absolutely be giving her a
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check her out at bugladysuzanne
here on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SufoilX is also available as Monterey
Horticultural Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up online because my local
Home Depot didn't have it, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably find this at a garden center or
somewhere locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it's widely available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run you $15.
[SPEAKER_00]: or $20 for something this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a small garden like me,
there's only 12 plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a huge bottle of SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be referring to it as SufoilX for
video, but it's Monterey Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticultural Oil, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good pointer if you're looking for a
smaller size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it works on a wide variety of
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls aphids, mites, soft bodied
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, it helps with things like
scale and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works as a suffocant for insects,
meaning they can't develop a resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works for fungus by not allowing
them to attach to the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very effective kind of your
all-in-one spray for fungus issues and for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one reason I like it right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is EPA registered and OMRI listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been approved for use in organic
production since 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it is EPA registered,
the company had to show a lot of research
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding efficacy on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of products on the market fall
under an exemption called 25B.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that they're good or
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that they don't have the
same regulation or research supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: their use in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things with like thyme oil in
them, rosemary, lavender, mint,
[SPEAKER_00]: those sorts of oil-based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to show that the
product works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to show what levels are
safe in regards to phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ingredients are considered generally
safe for human use or for agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just don't have to provide the
same level of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about being a
science-based company, ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to use products that have the
highest level of research and data to
[SPEAKER_00]: support their use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one reason I really do like this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the other reasons I like this
product is because of the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it really, really easy to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm able to use lower amounts of oil
relative to other oil-based products
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the emulsifier in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the droplets smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better at suffocating insects than
other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very low REI level, or REI,
at four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the return interval is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to everything I can find online,
it's very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the MSDS, which I was reading this
morning, really doesn't show much of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't want to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wear a respirator any time I
spray, and I highly recommend that for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, it's a very safe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always have that same level of
information about a lot of the 25B
[SPEAKER_00]: products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person commented on my Instagram
that they were worried about the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: a lab claimed that it lasts for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The residue of suffolex lasts on the leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not find any information about
that online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone has that data, I would love to
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't spray suffolex in flower
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see now, I'm in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to be spraying really
anything on this crop from here until
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I saw something pop up at this
point, I'm going to be bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, the plants look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as I'm not spraying onto the
pistols themselves, I really don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I don't really believe that
there is a lot of residue on these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything I can see with suffolex,
it has very low residue in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if there was on some of these
older fan leaves, I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: processing or consuming this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really see any risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be anything on the
buds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason why I think it's
perfectly OK to use suffolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to highlight the difference
between suffolex and some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that I'm spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suffolex is going to be sort of an
all-in-one silver bullet in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_00]: for most pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowed for use in organic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to worry about
phytotoxicity, efficacy, residual things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the things that Suzanne talked
about on the podcast is with neem oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the residue from the neem oil on the leaf
surface itself will actually prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials from returning to that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pests may get back in there before the
beneficials do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a risk associated with using
neem oil versus using suffolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people find this video informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to comment below with any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for checking it out.
Bye.
