[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Robert Thomas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert is the principal scientist at
Scientific Solutions, a consulting company
[SPEAKER_00]: that serves the educational needs of the
trace element user community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has worked in the field of atomic and
mass spectroscopy for almost 50 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: including 24 years for a manufacturer of
atomic spectroscopic instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob has written over 100 technical
publications, including a 15-part tutorial
[SPEAKER_00]: series entitled A Beginner's Guide to
ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also the editor and frequent
contributor of the Atomic Perspectives
[SPEAKER_00]: column in Spectroscopy Magazine,
as well as serving on the editorial
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory board of Analytical Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, Rob has authored six
textbooks on the fundamental principles
[SPEAKER_00]: and applications of ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: His most recent book is entitled A
Practical Guide to ICP-MS and Other AES
[SPEAKER_00]: Techniques, which was published in
September 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob has an advanced degree in analytical
chemistry from the University of Wales UK
[SPEAKER_00]: and is also a fellow of the Royal Society
of Chemistry and a chartered chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attached five articles from Robert to
the podcast page covering such topics as
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic stainless steel and glass
contamination in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the dangers and challenges in
measuring heavy metal contaminants and
[SPEAKER_00]: vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can access these by going to www

[SPEAKER_00]: tab and then Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Todd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with a little bit of
your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself and how you got into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an analytical chemist and I used to
work for an analytical instrumentation
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for them for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off in the UK and then they
transferred me to the US in the late
[SPEAKER_02]: 1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my specialty was in atomic and mass
spectroscopy, which is basically an
[SPEAKER_02]: instrumental technique that measures small
amounts of trace metals or heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my background and I became an
application scientist for them where I
[SPEAKER_02]: traveled all over the world talking about
the technique and particularly talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the benefits of using the
instrumentation that I was trained on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company was called Perkin-Almond and
they were one of the largest instrument
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in the world at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I took an early assignment package
in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for them for almost 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that I wanted a change,
but I felt that it was the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The retirement package was very
attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to leave that company and
venture into the world on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found the world of science writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to write a lot of papers and
application reports on the technique that
[SPEAKER_02]: I specialized in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a lot of editorial contacts out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tapped into those and I found out
that there was a demand for me for someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who spent almost 25 years working in these
techniques, but also spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_02]: writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found out there was a demand for me
as a freelance science writer,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was a little bit shocked,
but I took advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first big project was a tutorial
series on ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_02]: ICP-MS is the most widely used trace
element technique in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a technique that I've been
working in for the past 40 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: having actually cut my teeth on the first
commercial ICP-MS ever built in 1983.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they were interested in a tutorial
series for beginners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they called it A Beginner's Guide to
ICP-MS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a nice contract where I wrote an
article every month and it turned out to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a 15-part tutorial series.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of put me on the map,
which was great as a freelance writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You obviously like credibility and
recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that led to a lot of other gigs,
a lot of other writing projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was wonderful for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was happy doing that when a
colleague of mine said, you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: tutorial series that you wrote that would
make a wonderful book or it would make the
[SPEAKER_02]: start of a wonderful book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put me in touch with a book
publisher and we discussed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, yeah, we'd be very
interested in publishing something like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized that it probably wasn't
enough on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spent the next six months deciding
what would be included in my first book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only the fundamentals,
but I wanted to talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: applications of the technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to talk about what was important
for beginners, for novices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the goal was to write a book which was
focused on novice users.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2004, I started that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me about another 12 months and the
book came out in 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was called A Practical Guide to
ICPMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has since led to four editions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent one has just been
published in September of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that gave me a lot of opportunities and
it led me to become a lot more recognized
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the interim period, in between writing
different editions for this one book,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a lot of work for the American
Chemical Society and I led the Heavy Metal
[SPEAKER_02]: Task Force at the Analytical Reagent
Committee for the ACS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that put me in contact with the
pharmaceutical industry because our
[SPEAKER_02]: specifications and guidelines for reagent
chemicals was widely used by
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, United States
Pharmacopeia was going through the process
[SPEAKER_02]: of updating its heavy metal test.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heavy metal test which was used by
United States Pharmacopeia and the ACS was
[SPEAKER_02]: a colorimetric precipitation method for
doing lead and other heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it relied on the color of a
precipitate which was developed by adding
[SPEAKER_02]: a sulfide chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it was very user dependent
and it was not very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So USP was looking for a more sensitive
test and they decided that it would
[SPEAKER_02]: require a test using plasma
spectrochemistry which was my specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the late 1990s, USP together with
the help of the American Chemical Society
[SPEAKER_02]: sat down together to write a brand new
method for doing heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was intimately involved with that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2018, both the ACS and USP
came up with a standardized method using
[SPEAKER_02]: ICP optical emission and ICP mass
spectroscopy which was approved by the
[SPEAKER_02]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that came out in 2018 and I was
involved in that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, it was a lot of hard
work because the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_02]: had never used these techniques before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't particularly want to change
their methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But United States Pharmacopeia and the FDA
decided that they could not use a
[SPEAKER_02]: colorimetric test for carrying out a very
precise and accurate measurement of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals in pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, as I mentioned, that came out in
2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when a colleague of mine at
United States Pharmacopeia said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should take a look at the cannabis
industry because they are in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar situation that they don't really
understand sources of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very honored at that time to
actually work with United States
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharmacopeia and write another textbook
which was Measuring Elemental Empires in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharmaceutical Materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that came out in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2019, so again, that gave me a
lot of visibility to the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, in 2019, that's when I ventured
into the cannabis industry, started
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to lots of people, trying to
understand where they were coming from,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were doing, and just learning to
talk to cannabis users into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry about what was important to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that there was a lot of
ignorance, a lot of naivety, and I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: I could really help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in 2019, I started the process of
beginning to understand what was required.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I quickly realized that there was an
opportunity to write another book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 12 months later, I came out with
another book, Measuring Elemental
[SPEAKER_02]: Contaminants in Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that put me on the road of then
writing a lot of educational material for
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut a long story short, that led me to
get into understand the demands of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and really using my knowledge and
expertise to write educational material,
[SPEAKER_02]: give talks, really did as much as I could
to really help the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand that they probably could be
doing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brought me to get in requests to
do lots of interviews and podcasts and
[SPEAKER_02]: chair symposiums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's where I am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry for the long-winded
response, but my journey has been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: long, but quite adventurous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area that we don't have a lot
of information as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to talk to you
about lab testing and also cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to back up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone with a chemistry background,
why is this so important in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these regulations kind of hit the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we all understand that lead's
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's heard of the Flint water
crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why is it so important that we're
measuring and regulating these heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals in our final product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I learned very early on that
cannabis and hemp are hyperaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been used for decades to clean up
contaminated soil and contaminated land.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be aware that industrial hemp
was used to clean up Chernobyl after the
[SPEAKER_02]: nuclear accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1986.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an analytical chemist, I knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that certain plants have been used
for remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't that familiar with cannabis and
hemp, but I soon learned getting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry that here's a crop, here's a
plant that is used to clean up
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated soil of heavy metals,
you know, radionuclides, isotopes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are being generated by nuclear
fusion and nuclear accidents and nuclear
[SPEAKER_02]: waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's a plant that was also being
used, you know, to produce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were being used for medicinal and
for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, hey, this doesn't quite
compute here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely there must be a process to make
sure that hemp and cannabis that's grown
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabinoid production is not going to
be planted in soil or land, which could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially be contaminated with some kind
of industrial pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I found out early on that a lot of
the cannabis, I'm not so much hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: but cannabis back in the early days was
grown indoors, was grown in indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities where the growing environment
is far more controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hydroponics were one of the
processes that was used, but also to use
[SPEAKER_02]: grown medium, where you could control what
was in the material, in the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in the early days, heavy metal
contamination was not such a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when hemp became legal to grow,
people started talking about planting
[SPEAKER_02]: acres and acres of hemp in land and areas
of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: where, you know, where there might be a
lot of ingestual activity and certain in
[SPEAKER_02]: many areas of the western part of the U
.S., you know, the nuclear industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly areas which had been used for
mining of gold and silver, where there
[SPEAKER_02]: might be contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there didn't seem to be any
diligent way of finding out where there
[SPEAKER_02]: was contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when hemp became legal, back four or
five years ago, there didn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: any real interest in finding out was there
any industrial contamination in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in that particular soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I felt that here was something which
was potentially going to be a huge,
[SPEAKER_02]: huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so that's when I started
getting involved in it because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially something where I had a lot of
experience in working in those industries
[SPEAKER_02]: to use my techniques to better understand
how soil is contaminated and in what way
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that got me really
interested in an industry where there was
[SPEAKER_02]: no real, you know, there was no real way
to find out if hemp was being grown
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors, whether that particular soil or
that particular contaminated land had been
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated from any previous industrial
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to highlight for listeners
that there's a lot of research out there
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of, I see primarily around lead
and arsenic relating to neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders, birth defects and other major,
fairly catastrophic health effects
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with consumption or exposure to
these heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you want to touch
on before I throw out the question?
Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's fair to say that,
you know, that we've known about the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential contamination of all heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not only heavy metals,
but transition metals, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: radionuclides, you know, lots of metals
from all the industrial processes that
[SPEAKER_02]: have occurred in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past few decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly having a lot of experience
in the environmental field, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical toxicology field, we knew as
analytical chemists that were specializing
[SPEAKER_02]: in heavy metal contamination, that there
were ways to minimize the uptake of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, you know, tended to be cost
prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know based on food plants that are
grown in areas where there might be
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental pollution from, you know,
a power plant or maybe a steelworks,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's the potential to absorb heavy
metals into any food crops that are grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not just root crops,
but any kind of vegetable or fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in the soil, it will find its way
into the plant, into the root,
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the fruit, into what, you know,
whatever is planted nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are, you know, there are ways of
minimizing that uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, you've got to
understand the heavy metals or the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the contaminated land.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there are ways to minimize
the uptake of heavy metals into our food
[SPEAKER_02]: source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there didn't seem to be a way,
the cannabis industry, the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp industry, didn't seem to,
I wouldn't say they wouldn't, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: they weren't concerned, but they kind of,
you know, they kind of felt that maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the process of hemp or cannabis
absorbing that heavy metal, if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: planted in sort of clean soil,
which is away from any industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: activities, you know, there was a good
chance that, you know, the uptake wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be that serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we found with a number of
different crops, if they're planted near
[SPEAKER_02]: any industrial sites, there's,
you know, there is a good chance there
[SPEAKER_02]: could be a certain amount of heavy metal
uptake into that plant, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: root vegetable or whether it's a fruit,
you know, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's fair to say that when the
cannabis and hemp industry came along,
[SPEAKER_02]: there didn't seem to be a way of making
sure that the land where it was being
[SPEAKER_02]: planted was free of environmental
contamination, particularly the heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, you know, I think it's fair to
say that many industries were concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: about heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't seem to be serious at that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here was an industry that was not
really doing any diligent homework about
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals that might be resident in the
soil where it was being planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I have a question that kind of
leads into one of the questions I have
[SPEAKER_00]: that I get a lot from growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a fair question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what level of risk do you
personally associate with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being that it's a hyper accumulator of
metals compared to vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, our water, leaded gasoline from
small aircraft and environmental factors
[SPEAKER_00]: around all the leaded gasoline we used to
use back in the 80s and 90s, or just all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things that we're exposed to on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fair that this testing is coming in
so tight on cannabis relative to all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries?
[SPEAKER_00]: And exposure risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fair to say that the cannabis
industry exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I came into it four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having talked to people who were in
the industry way before me, there was not
[SPEAKER_02]: a great deal of thought that went into
sort of heavy metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And historically, you know, United States
Pharmacopeia was responsible for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, certainly responsible for
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, pharmaceuticals are
regulated by the FDA, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a long time for the
pharmaceutical industry to come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: any meaningful regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fair to say that when the
FDA got involved with regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals, particularly for heavy
metals, I don't think they were aware that
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't really consider that heavy
metals was a potential problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as the pharmaceutical industry
realized that there are many
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals which are derived from
products which are grown, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, particularly nutraceuticals and
dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they then took a vested
interest in understanding heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, United States Pharmacopeia,
when they first came out with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, methods for pharmaceuticals,
came up with a method for 24 elemental
[SPEAKER_02]: impurities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And initially, when they were just
monitoring a small group of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically led was the only heavy metal
they were interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they soon realized that when
you're producing pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly pharmaceuticals, which might
be made from products that are grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is the likelihood of finding a whole
slew of heavy metals in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it took them about 25 years
to go from basically monitoring one heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metal led to eventually monitoring 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the cannabis industry had a
model that they could follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they did not follow that
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided that the four most,
you know, the four most toxic heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals, lead, cadmium, arsenic and
mercury, were the ones which are of most
[SPEAKER_02]: concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the states started getting,
you know, when states started to regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: them, state regulators felt that four
heavy metals was enough because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, lead, arsenic, cadmium,
mercury, which were considered the most
[SPEAKER_02]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with regard to pharmaceuticals,
they realized that it was not enough just
[SPEAKER_02]: to monitor lead, cadmium, arsenic and
mercury.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they eventually ended up with a
list of 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the cannabis industry have
not progressed from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And state regulators felt that as long as
they monitored those big four,
[SPEAKER_02]: they felt that was enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some states decided to expand that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even the most diligent states,
for example, New York State only monitors
[SPEAKER_02]: eight heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So state regulators, state cannabis
regulators, have not felt that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary to expand that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly, the pharmaceutical industry
has set a standard of 24 element
[SPEAKER_02]: impurities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the standard United States
Pharmacopeia test for all pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we know, there are many cannabis
products that are used for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: grade products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's only a matter of time
before they eventually end up monitoring
[SPEAKER_02]: more than the big four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some states are proactive, like New York,
and is monitoring eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's only a matter of time,
and there's enough evidence in the public
[SPEAKER_02]: domain to suggest that if you start
looking at, if you start monitoring a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of the other heavy metals up
to 24, you know, you'll find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get the sense and I understand
from a chemistry chemist perspective that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're for your pro testing, which makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that I am, too,
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also realize as a grower or from a
cultivator perspective, it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really challenging because one,
it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts the onus on the grower to do this
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have to do this testing,
it raises our costs, which I think pushes
[SPEAKER_00]: people to the black market in a lot of
ways, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a risk associated there
that I hope regulators look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I've been thinking
about lately, too, is like when I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and I, you know, being health
conscious, try to buy organic foods where
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I buy organic onions out of Mexico,
for example, what assurance do I have that
[SPEAKER_00]: those weren't grown near an aluminum
smelter or a mine of some sort where I may
[SPEAKER_00]: be exposing myself to a much higher health
risk than if I bought onions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in, say, California using
conventional meth, fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's where I feel like this testing
onus is not being fairly expressed across
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our potential risks to our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, the only way I can answer
that is that I've been in this field for
[SPEAKER_02]: almost 50 years, you know, trace element
and heavy metal analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see industries go through a
logical phase in trying to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: where heavy metals play a role in that
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find that industries or
application areas that that that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, decided to be proactive with
regard to looking at heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the EPA is a is a big
incentive, you know, for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for drinking water companies, for,
you know, companies that that are involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in the environmental business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think with the case of large
industries out there, there's a there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's there's I think there's a there's
a feeling that, you know, heavy metals
[SPEAKER_02]: have been around for a long time,
and we are an industrial society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've managed to, you know,
we've managed to be an industrial,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, economy for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I think the point that I'd
like to make is if we are aware of a
[SPEAKER_02]: potential hazard, I think we should do our
utmost to make sure if there are large
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers of that product, where heavy
metal contamination could, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a vested interest to fully
understand how we can reduce the exposure
[SPEAKER_02]: of consumers, you know, that might be
exposed to high levels of heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_02]: being an analytical chemist, which is
specialized in in this area for the past
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see different industries going through
different cycles and different phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just feel that the cannabis industry
at the moment is is going through a phase
[SPEAKER_02]: where I think it understands that there is
a potential problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this present moment in time,
they're only being required to monitor the
[SPEAKER_02]: big four and in some cases, in some
states, a few more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly, heavy metal environmental
pollution is a serious concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the EPA have been doing
soil analysis for decades, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that near industrial sites,
there's a lot of industrial pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, if any crops are being
grown anywhere near the industrial,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the industrial site,
the, you know, the EPA, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: will, you know, will make sure that those
industries are being diligent in making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that they're, you know, that they're
monitoring these industrial sites for
[SPEAKER_02]: these heavy metals or whatever,
you know, metals are required.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that the cannabis industry at this
present moment in time, they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, they're going through the process of
trying to clean up their industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly, you can see that based on
environmental pollution, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we know is out there,
but certainly, if you're not looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: wider panel of environmental pollutants,
you're not going to find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's fair to say that in many
of the studies that have been carried out,
[SPEAKER_02]: up to now, that they're finding that,
you know, they're finding environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: pollutants which go beyond the big four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know, for example, that the
National Institute of Standards and
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology are coming out with,
you know, reference materials for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and hemp, which is finding 13,
14, 15 metals, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: are not being, the big four being
monitored, but they're finding there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, industrial hemp out there,
which is absorbing a lot more than the big
[SPEAKER_02]: four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, they're finding elements
like uranium in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because they're being planted
in salt, which is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that ASTM have, you know,
come up with a standardized method for
[SPEAKER_02]: doing heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: In cannabis material, and they just come
up with a method and they found out that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're up to 24 elemental impurities in
the standard method because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and hemp that they use to develop the
method contain quite high levels of other
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, which are not being
monitored.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know they're getting into the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're at a stage with regard
to, you know, standardization and making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that we coming up with a standardized
method that we're not at a point yet where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're beginning to look for a wider slew
of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only a matter of time before
once we start testing, carrying out a
[SPEAKER_02]: wider, testing a wider panel, it's only a
matter of time before we're going to find
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you're, I think you're
probably right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are going to see more and more
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we see more testing,
we'll find more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's hard to make an argument
against testing for heavy metals from a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to know that things are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's crazy that, you know,
we can have heavy metals in our baby food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I live on an island with about
8,000 homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 15 miles from a superfund
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have 10 to 20 PPM of arsenic in my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a grower, I won't grow vegetables
or fruit trees on my property,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I see them on all my properties and
other people around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, I think it's unfortunate
that I feel like, and nicotine would be
[SPEAKER_00]: another great example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have this level of testing with
nicotine, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's dive into some of the
nitty gritty of it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, so I kind of broke this up into
three sections, the vaping and consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: lab testing and cultivation and
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to go straight to lab
testing because you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of testing that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is really your strongest
area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, when I send in my samples,
how confident can I be in that lab testing
[SPEAKER_00]: and that result?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it comes back and says it has this
much PPMs of arsenic and this much
[SPEAKER_00]: cadmium, how accurate is that number
truly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the standard deviation that
we're talking about with such a small
[SPEAKER_00]: number for pass and fail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, that's a really good
question because the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_02]: new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fair to say that some of
the labs are out there and not of the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest caliber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not meant to be over critical,
but it's an industry that's grown rapidly
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And testing labs are springing up all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's some like 750 testing
labs in the whole of the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you divide that by the number of
states where cannabis is legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is about 40 approximately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a whole bunch of testing labs
in every state where cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the quality consistent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think some of them are well run
and they have a high level of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to understand that these
testing labs have sprung up so quickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've hired people who don't necessarily
have the desired expertise to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: technique like ICP mass spectrometry,
which often requires a decade of
[SPEAKER_02]: experience to fully understand how to get
the best out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complicated technique and it's a
technique that can give you bad data if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not using it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not being over critical here,
but I think many of these testing labs
[SPEAKER_02]: have sprung up so quickly and they've,
you know, they've ended up in warehouses
[SPEAKER_02]: in places which are not IDD suited to put
a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the contamination issues are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the expertise of the operator is not
there that sometimes they don't hire the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the best people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of a sudden you find that there's
people running these instruments in
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of experience in
using an ultra trace element technique
[SPEAKER_02]: that can get down to part per quadrillion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're being run in a warehouse,
it's almost meaningless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can argue that the 750 or so lab
testing facilities in the US, I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that they're all generating bad
data, but you got to understand that ICP
[SPEAKER_02]: MS is a very specialized technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that there is the potential for
lab error or issues with various labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is such a costly fail for a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes it can be the
difference between bankruptcy or staying
[SPEAKER_00]: in business because it's, we're talking
thousands if not tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars if you get a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do on the grower side to
better ensure that we pass a test?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking, I don't want to get into
cultivation inside yet, but I mean like
[SPEAKER_00]: should we be washing ourselves with
samples, should we be sending it to more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one lab prior to going in for that
final test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is dust something that's really a relative
concern with, you know, when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about such small amounts and such precise
testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we had to be realistic that
these, you know, these labs are being put
[SPEAKER_02]: together very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ICP MS is an ultra sensitive technique
and some of the contamination issues are
[SPEAKER_02]: not being addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with the best intent in the
world that you can hire someone who's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, reasonably competent,
but because you put in the instrument in
[SPEAKER_02]: basically a warehouse and they're not
going into specialized rooms, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware that contamination is a huge,
huge problem for a technique that's
[SPEAKER_02]: capable of measuring down to parts per
quadrillion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that the people who are in
them, you know, I mean, sometimes they're
[SPEAKER_02]: inexperienced, but the fact is that ICP MS
is typically placed in a clean room,
[SPEAKER_02]: is typically placed in a specialized room
where there can be no contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have a positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, you know, nothing can
be blown in from outside Normally the
[SPEAKER_02]: sample preparation area is separate from
the instrumental, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_02]: instrument because you're worried about,
you know, contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, when you're digesting these
samples, which contain high concentrations
[SPEAKER_02]: of mineral acids, you know, so you've got
to make sure that there's minimum
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what's happened is that these
cannabis testing labs have grown so
[SPEAKER_02]: rapidly over a short period of time is
that they're doing the best job they can
[SPEAKER_02]: do, but you've got to understand this is a
technique that was developed back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: early eighties to measure down to parts
per quadrillion level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's very difficult to explain what
that means, but this is a technique that
[SPEAKER_02]: was developed to measure ultra low levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, you know, the, the levels that
are being requested by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry are not that particularly low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, you know, the technique is probably
capable of measuring a thousand times
[SPEAKER_02]: lower, but because they have been housed
in non specialized equipment, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously not going to get the best out of
the technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that together with maybe they're
not hiring the best people who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really understand the capability of the
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get all kinds of contamination
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you combine that together,
I think it's fair to say that maybe the
[SPEAKER_02]: data that's been generated, I mean,
not by all testing, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: many testing labs are not considering the
technique they're using and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: considering where the technique is being
housed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I think that's detrimental to
get the best data and the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of us that are not familiar
with ICP, I've never been in a lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, what are some potential
sources of contamination that I may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have considered?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned being housed in a warehouse,
but like, let's say someone does have a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could, for example, I don't know the
clothing that someone was wearing or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially other things like,
could a prior sample potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminate the next sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are some of the things that
people should be looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've actually published quite widely
on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are things that people do if
they're not used to working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ultra-face environment, they just do
things where it's pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminate the sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just by, you know, digesting and
dissolving the sample, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are typically done in microwave
digestion systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're not diligent about keeping
your microwave digestion equipment clean
[SPEAKER_02]: or using ultra-clean acids, ultra-clean
chemicals, making sure that it's done in
[SPEAKER_02]: an area which is away from any,
you know, maybe sample preparation,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, you know, an area where they're
bringing the sample in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bringing the cannabis sample in,
bringing the flower in or bringing the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that has to be kept away from
where the sample is digested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you have to have, it has to be
done in a positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to be done within a few hood,
which is if there's any environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination, you have to have a positive
pressure under the hood, so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually taking away any contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, when you're using something
like a very sensitive technique,
[SPEAKER_02]: many industries, you know, you have to use
specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to use specialized
acids, which are very clean acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you might have to dress up in what are
called bunny suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, the analyst, is not actually
contaminating the sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite common in the semiconductor
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also when you're preparing the sample,
when you're diluting the sample,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to make sure that your acids
are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to make sure that you're using
the cleanest ultra-pure, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: deionized water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to make sure that the
instrument itself, you have positive
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction of the instruments,
and there's nothing that can actually drop
[SPEAKER_02]: down into where the sample is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there are many examples
where industries which are used to working
[SPEAKER_02]: in an ultra-clean environment take
multiple steps to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no contamination taking place in the
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in general, you know, the cannabis
testing labs do a reasonable job at that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think many of them don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, the data you're
generating is only as good as your sample
[SPEAKER_02]: preparation area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having seen a number of the sample
preparation areas of some of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: testing labs, you know, it leaves a lot to
be desired because they're just not used
[SPEAKER_02]: to working in the ultra-trace environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabis industry and cannabis
labs have, you know, have been set up
[SPEAKER_02]: often in, you know, warehouses or in,
in labs which are not considered
[SPEAKER_02]: ultra-clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a lab gets signed off on by
regulators, is anyone auditing these labs
[SPEAKER_00]: on a consistent basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The state, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it's a, it's, it's a state
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within, within the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: within the, okay, the state sort of
cannabis testing labs that are people who
[SPEAKER_02]: have expertise in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm, you know, I'm not too sure
they're being super diligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's fair to say that
these cannabis testing labs have sprung up
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very quickly and they fall into the
responsibility of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, the state cannabis testing
folks, which it, you know, there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there can be a lot of expertise within
that state lab or, you know, or there
[SPEAKER_02]: might not be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fair to say that it's not
like it's a semiconductor lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, you know, the semiconductor
industry is used to working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ultra-trace environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know how to set up an ultra-trace
testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably, you know, cannabis,
I mean, state cannabis labs have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have not really had to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, some of them,
some of them might be lacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying they're all, they're all,
you know, they're all lacking,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it's fair to say that,
that, you know, that some of the state
[SPEAKER_02]: labs have, I think have other priorities
and they might not be so diligent in
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that the labs, you know,
are doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's difficult to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, I guess this is the,
one of the other reasons I have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with adding more testing is until
they have the regulatory side figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: and consistent to where the burden of
proof and the impact is so catastrophic on
[SPEAKER_00]: growers for a failed test, until we can
have any confidence in these tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just doesn't seem right to roll out
more tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to move on just because I
have a bunch of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we can't do anything about the
testing, we can't really do a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations in the short term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the environment that we're stuck
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do as a grower to better
improve our chances of passing a test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I mentioned before,
like, should we be washing our samples
[SPEAKER_00]: with something like deionized or RO water
to remove any dust or particles that may
[SPEAKER_00]: have landed on the, on the bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you would
recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that before I
ask other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, I think, yeah,
I mean, I'm not too sure whether that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's kind of cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fair to say that,
you know, the cannabis industry has,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, got to the point where it's
grown, it's grown very, very rapidly over
[SPEAKER_02]: a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, I think I think
growers do a reasonable job of making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, that their product is
being tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I mean, I'm not too sure
whether it's kind of cost effective to go
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm just talking about like,
if I'm going to send in a sample to a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: for a five pound lot, for example,
to be able to pass, should I be cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: that small sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I so to phrase this another way,
like, for example, because of where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live, let's say I walk outside and I'm
carrying my sample and some of the dust
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know is 10 to 20 ppm of arsenic may
have been kicked into my facility or may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been kicked up on my way to my truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would that impact my sample passing or
failing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that little bit of dusk a real risk
when we're talking about such a precise
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, should I be cleaning just my
small sample, not my entire crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know how to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly if you're talking about
taking a small weight of the sample,
[SPEAKER_02]: typically half a gram is taken for
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that half a gram representative of
what's being sampled?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think it's unlikely that washing
is going to impact that half a gram of
[SPEAKER_02]: sample that's actually taken for analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think it's fair to say
that, you know, I think growers do a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable job of getting the sample in a
convenient form, you know, for testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the question I have is
monitoring just four heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, representative of what's in the
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think based on the number of
different growing conditions throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S., I think it's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fairly well understood that
based on what we know from environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: pollution, from a multitude of crops that
are grown, you know, for commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes, whether it's for, you know,
vegetables or whether it's for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, any type of I mean, I mean,
anything, I think it's fair to say that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so that there's so much
environmental contamination out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, clearly that there's a lot
more than, you know, just the big four
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, which could be potentially
contaminating any vegetable crop out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think it's fair to say
that that many of the industries which
[SPEAKER_02]: have grown up through you know,
from the food processing industry have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have taken a, I think have taken
a wider look at the other potential
[SPEAKER_02]: elements, heavy metals, which could be
contaminated in their crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not too sure that
answers your question, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially that we're probably,
you know, not monitoring enough heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what are potential sources of
contamination that should be looked at in
[SPEAKER_00]: a typical indoor facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we maybe talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, in an indoor facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously, there's less
environmental contamination for something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, clearly, but it depends what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you growing it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you growing it in soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you growing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it being grown hydroponically?
[SPEAKER_02]: What source of water are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I understand that like your media,
whether it's peat moss, rock wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa core, water, whatever that media is,
is a primary source of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think as a grower, the first thing
I'm going to look at is what is my media
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are the nutrient sources that I'm
using to feed this plant?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, I think water is a big source
of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a separate question,
but let's just dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned in your white paper that the
EPA estimated 30 million people live in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where drinking water violated safety
standards, which is crazy to me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's a lot of other risks out
here beyond cannabis that people are being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to on a daily basis that our
government's not regulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think about when I hear that
and something I've been learning with
[SPEAKER_00]: growers is let's just say that your water
passes for arsenic, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got a tiny amount or maybe that
amount is so small, it's not being picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up by the water testing facility because
they're only testing to a certain level of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I drink a gallon of that water a
day, I'm totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm putting 40,000 gallons through
a room that's got a cannabis plant in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of heavy metal, if we look at
it from sort of a mass flow perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be building up in that
soil, in that media, that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up by the plant over the course of
that growth cycle is actually probably my
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest source of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus just adding a little bit of bat
guano or a little bit of soft rock
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate, even if that soft rock
phosphate is much higher, say it's 20 ppm
[SPEAKER_00]: of arsenic, but I'm using a relatively
small amount compared to the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's going through my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a valid point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we know based on plants that are
using a very clean source of water and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's fair to say that EPA has done a
good job of regulating our water supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's fair to say that many
water authorities don't test their water
[SPEAKER_02]: on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be two years before they have
to submit data to the EPA that their local
[SPEAKER_02]: water supply is below the EPA guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is that in that two year
period, are there any of those heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals which are falling outside those EPA
limits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's no requirement to test it
more regularly than every couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not too sure that answers your
question, but certainly I think that most
[SPEAKER_02]: sources of drinking water in the US,
because they are regulated by the EPA,
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably clean enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we saw in Flint back in a few years
ago, is that people were negligent and
[SPEAKER_02]: they ended up using water which was
contaminated with a whole bunch of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't think that happens on a
regular basis, but negligence can create a
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess if I wanted to distill my
question even further though, I guess what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking is even water that may meet EPA
standards for drinking, for human
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, may not meet what standards
we should have for cultivation because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the massive amount of water that's gonna
go through a crop during a given growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I can answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends what those volumes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think potentially that could be the
case, but I think it depends on what
[SPEAKER_02]: volumes are used.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think it's fair to say because
there's been a lot of work done on looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at potential contamination sources in
water that's used to cultivate things like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis that's grown for making FDA
approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, FDA approved drugs, something like
Epidiolex which we know is grown indoors
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's produced in indoor facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when GW Pharmaceuticals who were the
original manufacturer of Epidiolex were
[SPEAKER_02]: going through FDA approval, I mean,
they had to show a lot of data about their
[SPEAKER_02]: process of growing cannabis indoors
because it's grown indoors, but certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: they had, obviously when they were going
through that process, they were impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: by United States Pharmacopeia at that time
who were monitoring up to 24 elemental
[SPEAKER_02]: impurities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had to make sure that their
growing process was ultra clean and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were checking their manufacturing process
at multiple points to making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: there were no heavy metals present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's an example of a product which
was grown specifically for producing a CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical which was aimed for
childhood epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just had to make sure that their
manufacturing process was ultra clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is, is there a
requirement for companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing or are producing cannabis
indoors or hemp indoors, are they dictated
[SPEAKER_02]: by something or do they have to go through
the whole process that a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer like GW Pharmaceuticals had
to go through to produce a CBD based drug
[SPEAKER_02]: called Epidiolex?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that water is a potential
source of contamination, that would push
[SPEAKER_00]: me towards reverse osmosis, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as you probably know,
RO waters is very wasteful to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive and costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the risks of using RO water?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, truly, you know, fairly pure
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that raise the risk associated
with its contact with different media,
[SPEAKER_00]: with metal or other things on its way to
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastics, glass, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that deionized water that's
utilized for laboratory use is really
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too sure that it would be cost
effective to use something like deionized
[SPEAKER_02]: or demineralized water, you know,
for cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think if a... I mean,
I can't answer that question because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know, but certainly your deionized
or demineralized water that's used for
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory use is extremely expensive,
extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not too sure it would be cost
effective to use that in a... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a whole nother level of purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But RO water tends to be very low PPM of
impurities by the time it goes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue with that from a... You
know, and this is where the chemistry gets
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit beyond my knowledge,
but I know that water wants to be bonded
[SPEAKER_00]: with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that being the case, when it comes
into contact, with metals and other
[SPEAKER_00]: materials, it can't potentially pull or
chelate with these heavy metals at a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rate than water that's mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to want to buffer water and pH
it prior to water in our crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates a lot of other challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was sort of what I was getting at
is like, what are the risks associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with using RO water in terms of its flow
into the media through our plumbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: through... Let's say I put it into a big
plastic vat and then I use a sump pump
[SPEAKER_00]: that has metal parts inside to pump it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the higher risks associated maybe
with corrosion or pulling heavy metals out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that pump that may have been made in
China and contain various levels of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals that weren't regulated with the
production of a sump pump, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think if your water was the only
thing you ought to be concerned about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I tend to agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I mean, I think you've got
to look at the entire growing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what else is involved besides
watering the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of nutrients are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of fertilizer are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is the plant being exposed to?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe, you know, I don't know
what kind of fertilizers you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but I think it's fair to say that,
you know, fertilizers can be a source of
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, is there any kind of...
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any kind of additional
environments that your plant is being
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed to in the growing process which
you're not fully aware that there might be
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of contamination around?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, I think it's fair to
say based on, you know, an historical
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective that plants that are grown
indoors in theory are going to contain
[SPEAKER_02]: less potential heavy metal contamination
than plants that are grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's still the opportunity to
expose your plants to some kind of heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's sort of... I think I
remember a few years ago that one
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer or one grower was using some
kind of... Was using some kind of bud
[SPEAKER_02]: enhancer which contained nickel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked me, was there some... Is
there the potential for the nickel in that
[SPEAKER_02]: bud enhancer to find its way into the
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone was using...
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember who it was,
so don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone was using a soluble silicate
material to increase the strength of their
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked me, is it possible that
they... And I said, yeah, if you're using
[SPEAKER_02]: any external sources of any metal,
heavy metal, transition metal,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in the growing process,
potentially it could end up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's in the plant, potentially it
can end up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The products that you're manufacturing
from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Is silicon a big health risk though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has a lot of different plant
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be argued to even be an essential
mineral in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends what level of course,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's... But there are
environmental controls of these elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though silicon is...
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an element that you find everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: In glass, for example, it's very difficult
to eliminate silicon from any material
[SPEAKER_02]: that's exposed to glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this grower was adding higher
concentrations of silicates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't even remember in what form it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think if you... Typically it's
potassium silicate is the most common
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you start exposing your
plant to percent levels of silicates,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a good chance you could
have higher than normal levels ending up
[SPEAKER_02]: in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do tissue testing and see higher
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher levels of silicon is associated
with reduced... Or higher pest resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually mitigates trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps toxicities by better spreading
those minerals throughout the biomass of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I haven't heard of a lot of things
associated with the risks associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: silicon because it is so ubiquitous in our
environment and in our crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got to get to the point where
obviously if you start finding really high
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of silicon in a product,
I think there could be questions then,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think historically, silicon has been so
ubiquitous in the environment that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the regulated levels in anything,
I mean, silicon levels are reasonably
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very difficult to not have any
silicon in any kind of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nickel, for example, nickel was used
as a bed enhancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, nickel is a carcinogen at high
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want high levels of nickel in
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nickel, I can totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this next question isn't
something that is your area of expertise,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are there best practices as a grower
we can observe to reduce heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, you know, maintaining a higher
media pH, taking samples from newer plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, removing more stem material?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things we can do as a
grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I think it's fair to say that,
I mean, you know, depending on whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing indoors or outdoors,
you know, certainly plants that are grown
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors, potentially there's going to be
higher levels of, you know, what I call
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, but elemental contaminants
because heavy metals, there's no real
[SPEAKER_02]: definition to heavy metals because it
could be one group to one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be group metals to one person and
a different group, you know, to another
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's fair to say that there
are ways to minimize heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, if you're working
with a, you know, higher soil pH,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a good chance that you're going to
be extracting, you know, certain heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metals based on, you know, based on a
lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fair to say that,
you know, there are ways to minimize the
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we know that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're naturally high in heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you want to try and minimize
based on the pH of the soil, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you also want to make sure that the soil
chemistry is, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just heavy metals, but you're talking
about the, you know, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium and nitrogen content,
you're talking about maybe the organic
[SPEAKER_02]: content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some soils are better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you can minimize the uptake of
heavy metals, you know, by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: by making sure your soil chemistry is
optimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, I don't think
you're going to, you know, stop the
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction of heavy metals from the soil
when, you know, when you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, particularly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you know, I just think that
you have to be realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, particularly nowadays where,
you know, most of the growing of hemp in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular is outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, you know, there's only so much
you can do to a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try and, you know, increase the pH
slightly by maybe adding lime to your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, the more acidic the
soil is, you know, the more chance you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to uptake heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there are materials to add
to reduce heavy metal uptake, things like
[SPEAKER_02]: organic biochar, which are basically
changing the soil chemistry and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, stopping the formation of ions
in solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you know, historically,
there are ways to minimize the uptake of
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, you know, for any plant
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my question is, is the cannabis
industry really looking at those
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches because they may be increasing
the cost of production?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's a lot of work done in
the area of biochar from natural products
[SPEAKER_02]: from, say, nuts and you know, biomass,
which is used to till into the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which really is a way of caption the heavy
metals and stops its bioavailability for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it cost effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a topic that I've been
researching pretty heavily in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who works with a lot of
different cultivators in various states
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a variety of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are things we're doing like
running a higher media pH in our soils and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing a very clean source of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not adding more heavy metals from
the way the biochar is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, testing all of our inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impossible to have a perfectly
clean organic soil and nutrient program
[SPEAKER_00]: because these heavy metals are sort of
ubiquitous in any mine product or any soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or any ocean based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are I think we are working to
reduce those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it really comes down to
management between our water and our media
[SPEAKER_00]: and our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we keep that level at a passing
threshold where the plant is going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it up, but take it up at a level that's
lower than what we're bringing in every
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to renew our fertility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is something that I think we're
actively looking to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a struggle because we're not
getting a lot of great information back
[SPEAKER_00]: from the labs or from regulators as we try
to navigate all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like I think that's where I'm
critical of the industry is that it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, if you like, my beef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the industry as a whole is not
looking at this problem and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: resolve it as an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are individuals parts of the
industry that are trying to do their bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as an industry, they're not coming
together because, I mean, clearly we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that hemp and cannabis are very strong
hyperaccumulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in the soil, hemp or cannabis will
find it and suck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, that's the type of plant
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, how I mean, how do you
minimize that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's in there, can you stop it
getting into your initial product,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are basically, you know,
an extract, which is going to be used for
[SPEAKER_02]: further use some way down the line to
produce a commercial product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole process of going from
growing cannabis and hemp to a consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: that's using something, there's a lot of
areas in between where the industry could
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, in my opinion,
I mean, having come from industries which
[SPEAKER_02]: have been highly regulated and knowing how
they've approached, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination of heavy metals from a wide
array of sources is that the industry is
[SPEAKER_02]: not working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Individual parts seem to be working in
isolation from the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it could be doing a lot more
to making sure that there are safer
[SPEAKER_02]: products out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, I'm not being critical,
but in the four years that I've been in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry, I've looked at individual
areas, individual components, and everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: is doing their little bit, but we're not
getting, the industry is not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: together as a whole and deciding how
they're going to approach this for the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit of the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, last question I have for you
because my friend and coworker,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon Hudson, watched, went to that
conference that you were recently part of
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about heavy metals, more from a
laboratory regulatory perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after attending, he said, I'm never
going to vape again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about vaping, you know,
and you've published articles on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link to those articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In five minutes, can you tell me why it's
so dangerous compared to other methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and why you would say it's
probably a good idea to not vape?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm fighting an industry here,
which is very difficult to really get them
[SPEAKER_02]: to fully understand what the issues are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I've never smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never smoked a cigarette in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can believe that, but I haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me either, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could look at an industry,
which is where vaping has become,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the percentage, but I would
say probably close to 50% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption of cannabinoid is done by some
kind of vaping device.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but that's my guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for an industry that's developed the
vaping systems with no real forethought on
[SPEAKER_02]: how the liquid or the product inside the
device is getting consumed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, we have a liquid,
it's diluted with something, maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: vitamin E acetate, maybe, actually it
isn't anymore, but maybe with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, propylene glycol or maybe MCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: MCA oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but, you know, the number of
opportunities for that solution to extract
[SPEAKER_02]: metals from the vaping device is numerous,
whether it's left in the device and is
[SPEAKER_02]: left to corrode the internal devices,
the internal, you know, metallic
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been shown that even when a
device has not been used, it's been on the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailer's shelf for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extracted metals from the coil,
from the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you start there, that even before
the device has been vaped, there are metal
[SPEAKER_02]: impurities in the extract, in the liquid
inside it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all of a sudden you ramp it up to
sometimes 400 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're taking those metal particles,
which have been maybe corroded from inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the device.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you begin to elevate the
temperature to four or 500 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius, you know, together with the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone is inhaling that and is going
into their airways, going into their
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting some satisfaction from the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where are those metal particles going?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being coated somewhere in the
person who's vaping airways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's clearly, there's very little
done to make sure that those vaping
[SPEAKER_02]: devices are not being contaminated with
metal components that they're made from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, my beef is that why isn't
there any effort being made to produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: much cleaner device?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that cost is probably the
problem, but there are metals out there
[SPEAKER_02]: which are far less corrosive than things
like stainless steel, okay, nichrome,
[SPEAKER_02]: Nikonel, Cantal, which many of these
devices have in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're notorious for, and in a
corrosive atmosphere, they're notorious
[SPEAKER_02]: for actually dissolving into the liquid,
into the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where, you know, where does it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes into the lungs of the person who's
vaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the industry has to do a much
better job of making sure that the devices
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves are cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much out there that I see which
has not been published, because this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something, if you like, I've kind of taken
upon myself to get a better understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I worked for Percal for 25 years
and we sold a lot of our equipment to the
[SPEAKER_02]: CDC who are responsible for characterizing
nicotine vaping devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although they publish a little bit on
their work, they have not really been
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to look at cannabinoid vaping
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my contact with the CDC says that who
knows what's going on with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: corrosion of metal components with these
vaping devices, because they can be a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more corrosive, you know, than nicotine
solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an area which I think is probably
going to have a lot more research done on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe it's a ticking time bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen the vitamin E acetic crisis of
2019 rear its ugly head with 300 cases of
[SPEAKER_02]: hospitalization and 70 deaths.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't like to appear to be
like a doomsday here, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially there's another vitamin E
acetic crisis waiting to happen with
[SPEAKER_02]: vaping devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just so widely used and there's
very little being done to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to really put a check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that raises some awareness
for people and they can make better health
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions or do their own research if
they're going to continue that practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I think it's fair to say
that the industry is moving very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think because of the industry is
moving so rapidly, you know, regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: often struggle to keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, you can argue that the FDA
will probably be involved at some point,
[SPEAKER_02]: although there's no real sign that they
really want to at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But state regulators have a vested
interest in seeing revenue in their
[SPEAKER_02]: particular site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't particularly blame them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the industry needs to take a
hard look at itself because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's stuff going on, which under a
federally regulated system, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, I really appreciate you
sharing all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your for your time today
and answering all my questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm glad I could help.
