[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now we're back with that African
compost, night crawler compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 100 times magnification here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I love alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great balanced food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to use, easy to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little peat leaf that some of the
fungi may be feeding off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that the bacteria really like
it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compare this to the control that
we had going on this compost where there
[SPEAKER_00]: really didn't seem to be a lot going on,
just giving them a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good shot right there where you
get the fungi and all that bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks great.
Thanks for watching.
