[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Stephen Arthurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephen graduated from the Imperial
College London with a master's of science
[SPEAKER_02]: in plant protection and integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also received a diploma in applied
entomology and went on to get a PhD in
[SPEAKER_02]: insect pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his postdoctoral work at Texas A&M
researching biological pest control for
[SPEAKER_02]: thrips on ornamental plants and
investigated insect virus interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: while conducting greenhouse trials to
evaluate new insecticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, he worked as a research
entomologist with the USDA for five years
[SPEAKER_02]: before becoming an assistant professor in
entomology at the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is currently a research associate with
Texas A&M University and also a technical
[SPEAKER_02]: sales specialist with BioB USA,
a leading provider of biologically based
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: BioB is the world's leading producer of
persimilis, the most effective natural
[SPEAKER_02]: predator of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited to announce that in
conjunction with this podcast release,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiss Organics has partnered with BioB to
offer their wide array of beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insects through our website and will be
shipping direct from insectaries so as to
[SPEAKER_02]: ensure optimal viability of insects upon
arrival.
[SPEAKER_02]: In today's podcast, we discuss the many
pests we see in cannabis and what some
[SPEAKER_02]: good management options are for utilizing
beneficial predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Stephen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked Suzanne, you know, we've been
working with BioB now and I asked Suzanne
[SPEAKER_02]: who to talk to over at BioB and she
mentioned your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you tell me a little bit about
yourself and then we'll dive into the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, my name is Stephen Arthur and I'm
with a company called BioB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally based out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have a subsidiary in the U.S.,
BioB USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I've been with them for about
three years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And prior to BioB, I was actually working
in research for a number of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a bit of a career change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was able to work with a
lot of these beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the lab and in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm sort of in the very much in
the the operational side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing them actually used in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been it's been an interesting full
circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm so excited to be able to start
offering BioB insects to our customer
[SPEAKER_02]: base.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that Suzanne has drilled
into my head is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: insects can't develop resistance to being
eaten to other insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving away from pesticides or reducing
the amount of pesticides we have offers a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited to be able to,
you know, dive into this a little further
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to get into some of the
main pests that we're seeing in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and what some of those bio control options
are and, you know, kind of talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: they work and what they do and give people
a little more information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why don't we start with,
you know, just a classic issue that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure everyone's had over the years,
which is spider mites, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: two spotted spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we how do we offer, you know,
begin to treat that from a bio control
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, spider mites are probably the
most common pest that we've seen in indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: groves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can become really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them really devastate the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they get bad, they can be quite
hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people struggling with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, if you do things the right
way, the spider mites are not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: that hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key really is to be preventative and
to once your crop is clean, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively easy to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you have a large problem that
needs clearing up where things get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, the several species of
beneficials seem to be relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and reliable for spider mite
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're primarily the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen a lot of uses of
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most commonly used one would
be Phytocereus persimilum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to do quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a few others as well that also
will feed on spider mites and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective in their own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned preventative and also a
challenge around if it gets really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things, you know,
a lot of this is me just regurgitating
[SPEAKER_02]: things I've learned from Suzanne over the
years, is that if it gets really bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm picturing like webbing in the case
of spider mites, we may want to consider a
[SPEAKER_02]: knockback spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sort of oil like, you know,
self oil X or something, and then follow
[SPEAKER_02]: that up after the appropriate interval
with a bio control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound like a good approach or
like, you know, persimilis in this case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound like a good approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, once you start getting webbing,
then persimilis can work on webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can navigate the spider mite webs,
whereas other most other beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and mites can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because you need a large number and
because once you start getting webbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of immediate damage is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people at that point would try to
bring the numbers down through use of
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether they be soaps or oils would be
the most common type and there's various
[SPEAKER_00]: types that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that would be most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a little bit challenging
because the webs can actually protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites to a certain extent from
sprays as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really need to come in with a
pretty high volume and you need to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: with good coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have actually seen some operations
come in with vacuums and try to suck them
[SPEAKER_00]: off off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite time consuming,
but they try to do that as a way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of those webs and some of those very
high population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, people will rogue
plants if they don't necessarily need them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to just kind of be very
proactive, they will get rid of some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the value of cannabis
plants, often that's not always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, once you put the numbers down,
that would be the time to come in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bioprogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're releasing your predatory mites and
some of your predatory insects as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're used for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you really probably want to come
in with a high rate, higher rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: higher frequency, at least initially,
and tell your problems and to control and
[SPEAKER_00]: then pay attention to your new crop coming
on because one of the spider mites do get
[SPEAKER_00]: around through being moved from workers
and being moved from pruning equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to be extra vigilant
once you have a source extra vigilant on
[SPEAKER_00]: your surrounding tables or even in your
surrounding rooms that your spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: are not transferring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really want to get that population
down to the point where things are clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can go back to a more
economical rate of application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in an ideal world, we're scouting and
catching these things early so they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get to that stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, when it comes to
application rates, a maintenance
[SPEAKER_02]: application or preventive application rate
would be significantly lower than,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, a treatment application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a wide range, different
ranges of rates that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most economical rate would be a
preventative rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're basically coming in,
you're treating your crop that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and your goal is to keep the clean
stuff to take out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those initial populations that are left
over or those isolated populations that
[SPEAKER_00]: either coming in from outside,
coming from another room, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically preventing them from developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you could definitely reduce
your rate down and also be more economic
[SPEAKER_00]: at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you're controlling an
existing population, then yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to use the rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the companies, that provide
information will give different ranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a curative rate or
preventative rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can talk to your suppliers or your
distributors and they should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: advise you, given the stage of your plants
and given your planting density and how
[SPEAKER_00]: severe your problem is, what might be a
reasonable rate to work with depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: your situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is there anything else that
persimilis is also effective against?
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of cannabis pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you talk a little bit about how we
would apply it, like the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: application itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So persimilis is sort of a one trick pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really only feeds on spider mites and a
few closely related spider mites in the
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not control russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not control any other pests that
you might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't control broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most IPM programs will have a range of
different beneficials to control the range
[SPEAKER_00]: of issues that they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so persimilis really is just for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're dealing with,
for example, if you're dealing with aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: or thrips or white flies or other pests,
it's important to have a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: program that tackles all of the issues
that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how would I go about applying
persimilis in terms of best practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So persimilis basically comes in several
different formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes as a loose format in a bottle,
typically in a vermiculite carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes in a sachet, a slow release
sachet now, which is something that bio B
[SPEAKER_00]: carries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often preferred for moms and
flowers and plants in the later stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, where you really want to try to
avoid contaminating your plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that could cause a contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those cases, the sachets are just hung
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes in a nipple form,
which you can just touch to the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: release the persimilis directly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Suzanne likes that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is quite time consuming though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to factor with the time
involved in going around to every single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those are the basic formats for
persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of how they're applied,
for most smaller grow operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're using the bottles,
you're basically just inoculating the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with one or two small doses of the
persimilis directly onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often that will be done every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, sometimes every other week,
depending on your pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sachets, they come in two forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a quick release form, which you're
putting on plants that already have spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a slower release form,
which you can use more preventively
[SPEAKER_00]: because they will release for about two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other types of pressurizers
or predatory mites are used for spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one called Neocytos californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the second most commonly
used predatory mite for spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in the same format, which we
directly release from a bottle or from a
[SPEAKER_00]: slow release sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that choice typically in veg is
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often quicker to release them
directly from bottles in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people will often move to the
sachets once the plant goes into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because then the plant's bigger,
there's more area to cover, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: more concern about contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes on mums and on flower,
the sachets are probably the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: form I see being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in veg, loose material from a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I do also do see with some
of the larger operations is that because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the amount of time taken to do a
treatment, some growers will actually mix
[SPEAKER_00]: their persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they'll combine it with other bios
and they'll mix it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll put it out with a blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows you to basically treat a
much larger area quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not treating individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're treating several rows at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these predatory mites are
relatively mobile, persimilis is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the most mobile of them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really can crawl on the bench and it
can climb up plants and it can even move
[SPEAKER_00]: between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's oftentimes in the larger
operation, putting them out with a blower
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a technique I see a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any situations where we make a
preference for californicus over
[SPEAKER_02]: persimilis with spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot talked about this
and everyone has their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some biological differences for
sure between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be some cost differences as
well, depending on your supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is I think you can use either
and you can use them individually or in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to find that persimilis is just
probably a little bit more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does feed on a higher number of spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in most cases more
effective when you have an existing
[SPEAKER_00]: population you're trying to bring down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only issue with persimilis,
it's a little bit less tolerant of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do grow dry, if you have an
average humidity, let's say 60% or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis may not be able to establish
very well in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may find if you're growing dry and
you can be preventative, californicus may
[SPEAKER_00]: be a better bet for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, really,
you can potentially use either or both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, just persimilis is just a
little bit more aggressive, has a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher spider mite consumption rate,
and it's a little bit more mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit better able to move
around than californicus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could always, I assume,
do a combination to really just cover your
[SPEAKER_02]: bases, I guess as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people mentioned that californicus
feed on persimilis eggs, which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, you're mass
inoculating these bugs and these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions that you do see with one
maybe feeding a little bit on the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see them generally jeopardizing
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your biocontrol program, for the most
part, they can still be used together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other advantage, I suppose,
in californicus, the sachets do last a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people will just use like a
Swirsky and the californicus sachet mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will cover spider mites,
and it will also cover thrips control,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are two pests that Swirsky seem to
do a good job on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that would be a combination of
californicus and Swirsky put together on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we were outdoors, would we want to
lean more towards californicus due to its
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to survive in greater
environmental ranges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you still using persimilis outdoors
with certain crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Florida, there's not too much
outdoor production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a bit more of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, the most important thing is to
look at the environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's particularly dry where you are,
then if you want to take some advice about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's going to be too dry for
persimilis, and if it is, then yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably want to use californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers also like to use andersoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one, which is commonly used
on cannabis for spider mite control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has similar characteristics to
californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, both andersoni, Swirsky, and
californicus can also feed on pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some situations outdoors,
pollen occurs naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows in, and they may do a better job
in establishing on plants that are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clean because they're able to survive
longer without food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also able to feed on things
like pollen, which persimilis is not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a longer duration of survival on
the plants can be an advantage in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I find that persimilis doesn't
live very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have food, but it does a pretty
good job at knocking your spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: populations down to a very low level,
even eradicating them locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really sometimes have a little bit
of a breather time before the spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: will reestablish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't necessarily need to have
live persimilis on the plants at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times, as long as you're inoculating your
plants frequently enough that the spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites can't get a foothold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't really think there's one
size fits all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think different people have different
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I mentioned some of the things
you need to look out for when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding which predatory mites to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's great information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one of the things about
biocontrols that I think people struggle
[SPEAKER_02]: with and why we need experts is because it
is a little more subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of variables to consider
when making decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of covered persimilis in
pretty good detail and also talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: californicus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you mentioned californicus also has
some suppression of broad mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could talk a little bit about
broad mites as a transition into another
[SPEAKER_02]: target pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broad mites are not as common as a
problem as spider mites, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly do get on on cannabis and they
can be a little bit more insidious because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit more cryptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, often they'll sort of hide in
the growing portions of the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're running along the mid vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they first get in, they're not so
easy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to look out for the symptoms
on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cause crinkling and deformation
on the young parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably going to see the
symptoms of broad mites before you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, luckily broad mites are not too
hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers, I think, with cannabis,
they find it useful to in their program to
[SPEAKER_00]: include something that's going to feed on
broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they don't necessarily have broad
mites, you don't want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the predatory mites,
swersky is pretty effective with broad
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Californicus also can feed on broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having something in there in your
program that will be able to take control
[SPEAKER_00]: of broad mites before they become a
problem is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the application for California case
similar to Per Similis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any differences there for these
mites in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different suppliers will have different
formats, but most of them come in a range
[SPEAKER_00]: of different bottle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's differences in
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're planning your program,
you want to look at the different bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes and the different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to put on a relatively
high rate, you want to get a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated bottle so that you're not
having to put a lot of extra carrier on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, which is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, if you're trying to
apply to plants that are spaced and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a large area to cover and you're going
to use a blower, then you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you've got enough volume to
distribute the mites you want
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to use a larger bottle or
a slightly less concentrated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a range of different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I do find that a lot of
cannabis growers like the sachets for
[SPEAKER_00]: various reasons, they're a little bit more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work a lot with ornamental growers
and they're always very, very price
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sachet is the more expensive way
to apply the same number of mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, because of the value of
the crop, that's not necessarily so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in situations where having a sachet
is advantageous, and so certainly in mums
[SPEAKER_00]: and in flower, then a few extra cents per
plant for applying a sachet is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the sachets make the application
simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may give longer levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You correct me if I say anything wrong
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer time intervals of prevention,
depending on the type of sachet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also keep any sort of carrier
like vermiculite off of our trichomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other advantages to sachets
that I'm missing here or something that I
[SPEAKER_02]: may have misspoke on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, so yeah, the main advantages would be
the extra time of release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of things like californicas
and cucumbers and swerski, most sachets
[SPEAKER_00]: typically will give you a month of
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're in a humid situation,
you can get up to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, longer duration, lack of the
carrier on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, of course, once the sachets on a
plant, most sachets have a date on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see which plants have been
treated when you're applying a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of carrier on a leaf that may blow
off or drop off within a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you happen to keep records or no,
you don't have that immediate ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a plant and determine exactly when
everything was applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be another advantage of a
sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, of course, is if you are
spraying, and I know a lot of growers do
[SPEAKER_00]: still when they're using bios,
they still like to come in and spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes perhaps more than they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind when you're spraying,
even if you're spraying soft materials
[SPEAKER_00]: like soaps and oils, these are still going
to be killing your predatory mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing your soft body beneficials
as well as your pests, at least situations
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're spraying them directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the sachet is generally
waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything that's still inside the
sachet when you're sprayed and comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently, once your spray is dried,
that can be a better way to combine sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: and bios is the use of the sachet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a reminder to folks to make sure
that what they're spraying works well with
[SPEAKER_02]: bio, with beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know Suzanne's a big fan of
stuff oil X because it doesn't have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of residual effect on the plant and your
beneficials can re-inoculate pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly into a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, she also mentions on the flip
side that neem oil, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: may deter beneficials from re-inoculating
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just something to think about when
you're thinking about what to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting back to the you know, you
mentioned California kiss will work with
[SPEAKER_02]: two spotted also with broad mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other target species for for
California kiss before or anything else
[SPEAKER_02]: for treating broad mites that we want to
talk about before we move on to another
[SPEAKER_02]: pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so so one thing we should probably
talk about, by the way, before I forget,
[SPEAKER_00]: you made you made a great point with the
sprays and Suzanne's point about neem oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be repellent is well taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to be spraying and using
buyers, it's very important that you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to spray first, release buyers
subsequently, not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, broad mites, two of the common
solutions for broad mites would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be two species of predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be your Swirsky and your
curcumerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't tell them apart by
looking at them, but they both broadly do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky is a little bit more flexible,
but they both will work for broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep in mind, if you're using
your your your buyers and you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: either Swirsky or curcumerus, it's really
important to keep in mind that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperature activity profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Swirsky is a more sort of tropically
adapted species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curcumerus is one that's used a lot more
further north and used in the winter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the south, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it does a good job if your
temperatures are going to be in the range
[SPEAKER_00]: of sort of 50 degrees to upper 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curcumerus, that's its sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will control your broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your average daytime temperature is
going to be in your 80s and your 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yes, you definitely want to be using
Swirsky because that one is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: better adapted to the warmer conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to keep that in
mind for for broad mite control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you mentioned Swirsky,
you know, I'm I'm cheating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at one of your sheets here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also Swirsky also works quite well
against thrips, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Immature thrips in reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we maybe we move on to thrips next,
since that's another common problem here
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trips can definitely be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, again, they can be hard to
spot early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a little bit cryptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, there's a few things about
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is there's a number of different
thrips we'll get on cannabis, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are easier to control than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so definitely if you got thrips,
you know, figure out which ones you have
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you're not sure, you know,
work with your your consultant or your,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your supplier or whoever,
your local extension office, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: know which thrips you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thrips are best controlled again,
sort of preventatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these predatory mites feed on
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky and Cicumorous would probably be
the two main ones that are used for
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only eat the smaller stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cicumorous really only eats the first
larval stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky can feed on most.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also feed on the second larval
stage, but they're not going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, feeding on the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your adults are still going to be out
there potentially laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important if you have
thrips that you're maintaining a coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: of your predatory mites continuously,
because what you want to do is you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent all of that, all of that
reproduction of the thrips that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go on in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to prevent those larvae from ever
really developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to maintain a fairly
constant source, whether that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, typically that would be weekly,
either sachets that will continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: release your predatory mites for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're not using sachets,
you probably, you have a thrips issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably want to come on every single
week and be releasing your predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about thrips is that,
especially when you have a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: established infestation, you probably want
to add something for the soil stage as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, because your thrips, once they get
into the soil, your predatory mites are
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be feeding on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got thrips coming out from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have a quiescent stage in
the soil, and then they develop into
[SPEAKER_00]: adults and they come up and then they
start laying eggs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not until those eggs start
hatching then that you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to start controlling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a better way to break the life cycle is
to add something for the soil stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several soil predatory mites and
insects which will feed on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that situation, if you have an
established infestation, you probably want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be using something both for the soil
stage as well as for the stage on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend then for a soil
application if dealing with thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's three main things that
people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is another predatory mite,
which has got the rather long name Stradio
[SPEAKER_00]: leylaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually formerly known as
hypoaspis, so a lot of people still call
[SPEAKER_00]: it hypoaspis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a larger mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a different family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the leylapid family, and it lives
on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really get up onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a generalist that will feed on
things like springtails and thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae, and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably used mainly for fungus gnats
control, but it will feed on those stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of thrips in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding something like that would be a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one, a rose beetle,
which is very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Delosia or a Theta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually fly in situations where
you have, maybe you're not growing as
[SPEAKER_00]: clean as you want, and you have things
like thrips and fungus gnats, perhaps that
[SPEAKER_00]: are populations that are coming from the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got weeds, or you've got some
dampness where you've got algae and things
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a source of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be good to clean it up, but using
some of the rose beetles can be good in
[SPEAKER_00]: that situation because they'll get around,
they'll get into those corners,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can even establish, and they'll
be a good thing to use in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third option would be the
beneficial nematodes, which we didn't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they can be used in
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drench the plant at any stage,
potentially, if you have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, that would be something
that you would use in younger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have issues with thrips and fungus
gnats, you would come in, and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely incorporate nematodes in that
situation as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and which nematode would you
recommend for dealing with thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's several species of nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that works best with thrips is
Binonymus LTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people have such a problem
pronouncing some of these names,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just call them by their letters,
so SF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, that's probably the one
that's primarily used for thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works relatively well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get temperatures in the upper
80s, it doesn't really work too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that you want to try to
use in the cooler part of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the cooler part of the season,
or have some kind of cooling in your
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these things need to be
kept, they don't like it too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to put on a high volume,
you need to keep the media wet for several
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do great in things like rock
wall, anything where you have a very fast
[SPEAKER_00]: draining system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil-less media, they don't work quite as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take some advice from your supplier
about your situation, and make sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a nematode, you're using them
in the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few little things to watch out
for with nematodes, like they can clog in
[SPEAKER_00]: filters, and they can drown if you mix
them up and leave them sitting around for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while before using them, and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now when you mentioned temperatures,
you're talking about soil temperatures in
[SPEAKER_02]: this case, since we're talking about
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, ideally, we don't have,
you know, we're not in the 80s anyway with
[SPEAKER_02]: our crop, at least indoors, in terms of
soil temps, just to keep cannabis happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of jumping around,
I guess, a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything else regarding thrips
that you wanted to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I should mention one of the species
of thrips, it's often it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: Poinettia thrips, or Echinocrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dark, fairly dark, slim-looking
thrips that doesn't really get controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: very well by any of the buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that situation, you really need to
have a spray program or an alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: program to target those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, make sure you know
which thrips you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some growers that I know,
they do like using Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos is the pirate bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you may be familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generalist, but it does like to
feed on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there was a question about how
persistent it is in cannabis, because if
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos doesn't find anything to eat,
it kind of doesn't really hang around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because it can fly, so it can
disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, some growers,
they use a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generalist, they like to have it
around, even if it's not very persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, it's a good insurance policy for
adult thrips, because of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will feed on the adult thrips as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also other ways we can maybe
talk about a little bit, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways to encourage and keep some of
your buyers around in the crop longer by
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that Oreos would be an example of
something that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially feed using pollen,
or a Festea eggs, or a product that BioBee
[SPEAKER_00]: has is based on a type of decapsulated
brine shrimp egg, which Oreos just love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got videos of them going to
town on this stuff, they can reproduce on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot less expensive than a
Festea eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are potentially ways to,
you can buy, for example, you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: Swirsky that contains the food in the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're putting it out,
if they don't necessarily have much to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crop, then you are giving them a
food source application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps keep them happy and will
reduce their ability to spread and fly
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so I should have mentioned Oreos
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think that's the main aspects
of thrips I think we covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to highlight one thing you
said, just as a gentle reminder to folks
[SPEAKER_02]: too, is that it always starts with
identification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned that there's various
types of thrips, some are controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: certain ways, or maybe slightly
differently, or less controlled than other
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take the time to scout to get proper
identification, which is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: posting it in a Facebook group asking what
is this blurry photo, but make sure it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets in front of an entomologist,
someone that can actually give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: positive ID, and then come up with a
treatment plan based on that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is stuff that just,
Suzanne just drills into my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Suzanne's been doing this a long
time, and Suzanne's probably the best out
[SPEAKER_00]: there at what she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one of her pet bees is some of
the misinformation that can go around on
[SPEAKER_00]: some forums and chat boards and that kind
of thing in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some bad information out there,
and there's also lots of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, knowing which is which and
getting a good ID is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the first thing you really
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do see people maybe applying,
for some of us, when the problem they have
[SPEAKER_00]: is not spider mites or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're potentially just wasting your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a great point,
Pat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear these stories about
facilities either doing massive
[SPEAKER_02]: over-applying of beneficials because they
have the wrong rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that's from a potential
consultant, or the issue is they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: not applying the right insect for the
right problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where people get into this idea
that biocontrols don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm grateful because I'm not an
entomologist or anywhere near an expert on
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful for some of the people on my
team that are more knowledgeable than me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then also having resources like
yourself and Suzanne and other people at
[SPEAKER_02]: BioB that I can get a positive
identification just to back up my own
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge as a way of making sure that my
record recommendation is going to be on
[SPEAKER_02]: target for what's actually going on in a
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to go back and touch on that
because too many times I think people get
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead of themselves or they see a problem
on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They post a photo of a blurry insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it's one thing and then it
turns out maybe it's innocuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a soil dwelling mite or maybe
it's not what they thought it was or a
[SPEAKER_02]: different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just wanted to go back and touch
on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, unless there's anything you
want to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I just wanted a real quick thing
that related to what you just said that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of people sending pictures all
the time of different things and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: times the picture quality is just low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to identify things without
a good photo, especially mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mites can be hard to control, hard to
identify even from good pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you need samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, idea is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting good quality photos is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing you said,
which I see a lot is especially once
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in hoop houses or you're
growing outdoors, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different incidental things that can come
around and then a lot of them are not
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see various bugs that will just come in
from outside and maybe they'll even feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on a leaf for a little bit, but they don't
have the capacity to reproduce,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're not going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by all means, get everything
identified, but don't feel like just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have a particular bug in the
facility that that's necessarily something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to spray for or control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be something that's just innocuous
and you just need to keep an eye out for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the more you spray, the more
you're going to be impacting your
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making unnecessary sprays is probably
just as bad, if not worse, than not making
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways than missing sprays that you
need to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use what you have as a guide to what
you need to do in terms of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: particular facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point, especially about
having a high quality camera because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard enough to identify these mites,
much less with a blurry photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely worth the investment in
getting a decent camera to take a good
[SPEAKER_02]: photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times your phone camera just
isn't going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing that you mentioned was
people treating for things that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we work with a lot of growers doing
what people are calling living.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you're familiar with
it, Stephen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this idea of reusing soil typically
beds and managing the fertility in it over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do see a lot more insect life in
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see a lot of orbited mites or
you'll see people that will spot mold
[SPEAKER_02]: mites that may come in with a beneficial
insect application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just important that we get the
right ID there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where we always have to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do see orbited mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often just a secondary issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see typhophagus mites coming in,
various different things that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: just pretty innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one thing you mentioned
earlier, which were the isopods,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I haven't personally seen,
but I know that can be, I know whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to mention those or not, but that can
be sometimes some of these soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil issues you have are very much reflect
how you grow, whether you recycle soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much organic matter you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you said that you've seen
sometimes those can actually be causing
[SPEAKER_00]: damage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we see really high levels of organic
matter in a soil, sometimes those
[SPEAKER_02]: populations I found can get out of control
and actually start chewing at the,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the stalk itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one or two, probably not a
problem, but you know, I've seen it where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like hundreds or probably
thousands in a given room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I typically recommend mass
trapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can even put like a sticky sticky
tape or traps around the stem of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to help kind of just stave off that
damage while you're trying to get it back
[SPEAKER_02]: under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there aren't, as far as I know,
a lot of good options other than maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing their food source by removing
some of that organic matter or that cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop or something else that they may be
surviving off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, did you want to add, add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I, I like the idea about mass
trapping and possibly changing your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, how you grow, what soil you use more
than coming in and trying to spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea more, but, but no,
that was, I don't really have anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: any direct experience with using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also see super high levels of
spraying tails sometimes, which again are
[SPEAKER_02]: not really problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I do see a lot of photos of those
showing up online and I have seen them in
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of grows I've walked into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things that you list actually
feed on springtails, some of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we talked about, it sounds like,
so I thought that was the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Springtails are not normally an issue,
but if they get into be high numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there is some, some evidence
suggestion that they can vector some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get to be high numbers,
there are certainly some species of
[SPEAKER_00]: springtails which will feed on young roots
potentially can cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, there's lots of different
springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of springtails,
um, I would probably caution about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, some of the, the,
the, the predatory insects we mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, the, the rose beetles,
as well as some of the, the, the
[SPEAKER_00]: stradiolatops mites, they will feed on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's something that you might
want to consider putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of springtails,
just to, just to reduce the risk of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those problems happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good point that some of these
insects can be vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's something to factor in as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's, you know, we haven't even
talked about some of the major pests that
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are going to tune into this
podcast to want to hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just knock out, um, probably one
of the most common ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and definitely not one of the
more damaging or worse ones to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with, which is just fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, give me your thoughts around,
around fungus gnats in terms of how you
[SPEAKER_02]: like to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fungus gnats shouldn't, should not be
difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you shouldn't really be in a situation
where you're having a lot of fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, most, most fungus gnats,
you know, there's a, there's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few ways to approach fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is, um, are you, you know,
are you growing too wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, fungus gnats, of course they,
they're feeding primarily on, on algae
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, and, and fungi that grow on the
soil or they can also grow, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the non-crop area on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your, if your facility is not too
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've, I've also seen them coming out
of, um, water walls, feeding on water
[SPEAKER_00]: walls and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so having a, having a clean grow,
not growing, you know, not growing too wet
[SPEAKER_00]: is the primary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are pretty, pretty easily
controlled again by, by the, the
[SPEAKER_00]: stradiolalaps mites we talked about,
the road beetles, and again, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stony nematode, all of those things,
um, will control fungus gnats pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing I would perhaps add is
that if you have an established
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation, fungus gnats have quite a
long life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a month or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the biocontrols, you're really
only targeting the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got potentially a fairly long
lived adult stage, people stage and egg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage that are not being targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those to cycle through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a lot of fungus gnats and
I've certainly seen this in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can take a couple of months or more,
um, before those numbers drop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some people might want to
come in with a, with a, with a pyrethrin
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and try to knock down the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely putting up sticky traps
will help, um, monitor and to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, if you, if you, you know,
sticky rolls all the way around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you can help bring the numbers
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: More quickly, but in general, um,
fungus gnats should not be too,
[SPEAKER_00]: too difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I like the idea of SF nematodes,
um, as my primary way of dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but I'm glad you mentioned a couple
other ways of treating for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see them quite a bit in, because we use
compost as a fraction of our soil mix and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really inevitable when we have
organic matter that's been outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point in time, uh, you can't have
all the biology in the compost and then
[SPEAKER_02]: not have the potential for fungus gnats
and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's, it, you know, seasonally
will become an issue sometimes,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, which is why, you know, pre-treating
with SF nematodes or being on a
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance schedule as a preventative
just makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you don't get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that mass trapping infestation
stage where you're having to having to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about spraying and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats can come in on eggs on,
on media.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying in media, unless it's
sterile, um, it's not uncommon for fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: net eggs to be in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they'll, they'll,
they, they, they'll hatch once the media
[SPEAKER_00]: gets wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're, you, that's where your,
your source can, can come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you say, or if you have your media
outside, it can get contaminated that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that situation, you'd probably want
to treat, um, you'd probably want to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: your young plants for sure with a drench
for nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the new products actually that
we have is a nematode in a, in a capsule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, um, uh, is a slow release capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can actually be incorporated into
your, your, your plugs or your media,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, your young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the advantage on that is it allows
you to have a long application of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes during that critical period when
the plants are putting out their first,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, roots where drenches can be a little
disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to disrupt your plants when
they first start rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, uh, in that situation,
you can actually incorporate these
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode capsules into your, into your
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you don't have to drench,
but then you've still got the extended
[SPEAKER_00]: release of the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's something new we're kind
of excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so yeah, that's another,
that's another option as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Nema plus depot 200 is the
product you're, you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 200 capsules, 320,000 nematodes per
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just come out in a, the, until now it's
come in these tiny little packets with
[SPEAKER_00]: about 200 capsules in, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a small number of
plants, but I think now it's now becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: available in a bag of 32,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little, that's, uh,
I believe that should be available
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime in the next month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's something that, um,
you could maybe put on a, on the potting
[SPEAKER_00]: line or something and, uh, and,
uh, treat every plant, uh, as it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck or depending on how you,
how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, so that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that can be potentially
automated as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've seen these then put on automated,
automated mason lines where every pot gets
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with a few capsules, um,
as part of the production line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's, uh, that's kind of a,
I think where the future would be for
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus back control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't, I haven't seen this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can you describe what it actually
looks like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also how you, how you apply it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you burying it in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just going, you know, relatively
close to the surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you watering it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what can you tell me about that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was developed for the,
it's actually developed for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the home, uh, for the, um,
house plant market where people would,
[SPEAKER_00]: would, you know, maybe they'd be going
away for a few weeks on vacation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they, they'd want to treat their house
plants or fungus maps, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to be spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could just get a few of these
capsules, make a little hole, few holes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, put them in, cover them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the ag market, which is kind of the
new market for these things, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a hundred percent clear what the
best, how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, but what seems to be the best way
is just to put them on a potting line,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and, or put them in your plants when
they're first, um, uh, when they're first,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, the capsules have to be in
the media that you can't top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, either you put them in the
planting hole when, when the plant goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in, or you incorporate them into your
potting mix, you mix them into your
[SPEAKER_00]: potting mix, and then that potting mix is
pretreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or you find some other such way to
incorporate them, uh, into the,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the top, uh, into, into the pots
where they have to, you know, some device
[SPEAKER_00]: to make holes and then put them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it's not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would depend on, on everyone's
situation, but, um, and like I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of something new,
but, uh, I really see, uh, this being a
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful tool where people can just
kind of get their, get their fungus nap
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment done straight away when the
plants are first, uh, stuck and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about it for maybe at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if those plants are big enough and,
uh, got enough root system by the time the
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules are done, maybe fungus naps are
no longer a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do have to come in and drench
with nematodes later on, um, the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: very well developed and the drench is not
going to be so disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should talk about that more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that you made me think of
too, is in a facility, it reduces,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think employee error in
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, potentially not getting an
even application of nematodes across all
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants or, you know, mixing and not,
not properly applying to where you may be
[SPEAKER_02]: damaging your nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that's really interesting as a
reason to potentially use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picturing like a, um, like a fish oil
capsule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that anywhere close to what they
actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they look a little bit like caviar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the capsules are made from food
grade material, like a calcium alginate,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflower, um, uh, oil emulsion in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can eat these things if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it, but, um, they're, uh,
they're, they're all food grade materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they're pretty persistent in you
know, they, they, they store well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they just look like little kind of
little, um, uh, little soft, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules of, of like caviar or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, they come in these bags and,
and, uh, yeah, we're excited to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: this goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I want to save time for what's,
what's sort of new, uh, from BioB and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing in the industry,
but I also realize we at the very least
[SPEAKER_02]: need to at least touch on, um,
or maybe I need to do another podcast with
[SPEAKER_02]: you on, uh, we haven't even talked about
hemp russet, canvas aphid or root aphids,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, as the main three and then caterpillar
leaf miners and whiteflies as sort of more
[SPEAKER_02]: minor pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what, what would you like to,
what would you like to tackle next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, we can mention hemp russet might
briefly, um, that that one can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if it gets well established,
it can be a, can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one that really, um,
you know, that there's some debate about
[SPEAKER_00]: what role bios play, but for sure,
I would, I would think that if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: existing infestation of hemp russet,
might you, you've got to have a spray
[SPEAKER_00]: program to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, stuff oil X, um, sulfur sprays,
um, some other, um, uh, paraffin oil type
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays need, need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you can potentially,
uh, dip your, dip your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to, you need to deal with that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your hemp russet might
populations are under control,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there, there, there is some,
uh, evidence that having something like
[SPEAKER_00]: swirsty or curcuminous in the mix can
potentially help prevent your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming reinfected.
[SPEAKER_00]: With new sources of hemp russet might
coming in, but I know this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne's got quite strong opinions on,
um, that the beneficials themselves are
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be an effective way to get
rid of an existing infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't, don't, don't wait around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got hemp russet, Mike can say it
tends to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you need to have a strategy for,
for dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if you apply it in the right way,
it's not that difficult, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, yeah, stuff oil X I think is
probably one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, treatments, um, out there to,
to, to, to deal with an existing problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also example of where you need a
really good camera or scope to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to spot them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're very easy to identify once
you have the right tools, but without the
[SPEAKER_02]: right tools, you'd be struggling,
I think, to make a positive
[SPEAKER_02]: identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're probably the smallest pest
that you're going to be dealing with in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they really are, um, even with a 10X
hand lens, that then there, there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, you, you, you, that's a
situation where you might want to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: get to your little dissecting scope out or
something and get your samples under there
[SPEAKER_00]: and dig around and find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, the same with broad mics,
you know, the head russet mites and broad
[SPEAKER_00]: might, uh, are often too tight,
misdiagnosed problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will see an issue on a planet and
they'll just say, well, that must be
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide or that must be rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might, the truth is you actually have
to find these critters and confirm that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on the planet before you can be a
hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're not easy to get a positive
diagnosis without actually finding them
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can get other symptoms,
um, that can cause potentially similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, other things called similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's a great, great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you, you identify them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on then, uh, cannabis aphid
and root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are other, these are,
um, uh, two more difficult pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're going to get aphids,
my advice would be to get cotton aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: and green piece aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're easy to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get aphids,
um, not that they can't be a problem if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to treat for them,
but they, they buyers work very well for
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the parasitic wasps, um,
they're really inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have them as part of your program,
um, the you shouldn't have too many issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aphids are a little bit tougher,
um, to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buyers don't work quite as effectively
for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now if you do use parasitic wasps for
aphids, um, they do the common types of
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic wasps, which you're using for
your common aphids, they will parasitize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aphids, just not as effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but having, having them in the mix
will definitely help slow, slow down the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of cannabis aphid going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it goes crazy and it starts
spreading, it can be a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so cannabis aphid, yes, you know,
you want to have, there's, there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people at this point will bust
out the sprays and they'll try to spray it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, you know, you, that can
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get the good coverage and you
also need to be aware of what impact
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having on your other buyer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I see also now is that some
growers will use predatory insects for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a lot of interest in using
lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, lace wings now are more readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relatively inexpensive and they
can be put out in large quantities as eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: in mixed in with things like predatory
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will just say, Hey, we're just
going to add some lace wings into this
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, lace wings are fairly mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get around and they're,
they will definitely feed on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, you have a, you have some
different options there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've also seen lady beetles released
in, in cannabis for, for cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not generally recommend those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only ever really work if you have
very, very high populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have your, your cannabis
aphid population getting that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and let's also touch on the fact
that most commercially available lady
[SPEAKER_02]: beetles are wild harvested, which is not a
great practice and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: something that as a consumer, we would
want to support for its, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: vector of disease and environmental
damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, I hear there are some
commercially available lady beetle
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there is one company that does,
um, rear the convergent lady beetle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the one that you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's normally wild collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, artists, they, they, they do rear it
in culture, but it's very limited supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, like lace wings are probably
going to be a more reliable, more cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way of, um, of as a generalist
predator for aphids then, then,
[SPEAKER_00]: then lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go more down the, the lace wing
route than the lady bug route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but yes, yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just wanted to mention, I've had
some friends have success with heat
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment with cannabis aphid,
um, by just massively overheating their
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been able to knock back
populations that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it is a really, really tough pest,
um, to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it just keeps coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like, and so, uh, that's just one
other suggestion I wanted to throw out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he had any thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know what the exact
temperature you'd have to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd imagine you'd probably want to get it
up into the mid 40 degree Celsius range or
[SPEAKER_00]: something before you for a few hours,
probably because that's a, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: idea if you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one really important thing about
cannabis aphid, which you need to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind is that it's, it's, uh, it's
monaceous on cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas other aphids are going to maybe
fly in, come through a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in on, come in on a weed,
um, come in on someone's clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aphids, they can only really come
from, um, from, from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, or, you know, cannabis plants in
the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, if you have it, you gotta
figure out, well, where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it didn't just fly into a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing to keep in mind is if
you, means if you can get rid of it from
[SPEAKER_00]: your, from your facility, then it's then
as long as you don't bring it in again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more, um, there's more
motivation to make an effort to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to try to get rid of it, because if
you can get rid of it and not bring it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your problem's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Well, the other thing too,
I think you, that you brought up a minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit ago was this idea of
identification again, uh, just to harp on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you know, aphids can be color
morphs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't necessarily get a positive ID
just based off the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne's been like, Tad, you have to send
me a closeup of their genitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I wanted an ID once of an
aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that it's a little more complex
and I, so I just want to again,
[SPEAKER_02]: suggest that people get a positive ID
before jumping to the conclusion about
[SPEAKER_02]: what the aphid species is, uh,
that they're necessarily seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both thrips and aphids, uh,
you need an IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the species level you're saying
versus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis aphids aren't that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is you want to look at
their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these little horns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually tubercles kind of between
their eyes and they look like little devil
[SPEAKER_00]: horns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, there's not really any other,
um, aphids on cannabis that have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, once you see these, um,
that's a pretty sure bet you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good pointer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dreaded rude aphids, uh, this might be
the most frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't say if it's pretty
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hemp russet, but this is
definitely in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, uh, what, what are your
thoughts on rude aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rude aphids are, I always used to think,
you know, if you've got rude aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to eradicate them and just get
rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I think about it and the more I
see how difficult they are to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in established, um, grows,
uh, I think a lot of people are just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of living with them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and, and they can be
managed to, to acceptable levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, if they're not managed,
then yes, they, they, the issue with rude
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids is they tend to get, they tend to
get in on, on your stock, on stock plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you've got plants around
for a long time, the risk of them getting
[SPEAKER_00]: established, rude aphids seems to
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens is then they,
they start bubbling out of the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and then they fly around and then
they'll make their way, um, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to around the facility and then they keep
kind of spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you were always kind of like
putting out little fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, rude aphids, you have to have,
um, you have to figure out where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from and you have to use root
drenches to try to maintain even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't eradicate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you should be to maintain a pretty low
levels with, with root drenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most cannabis guys, they use some
combination of, of botany guard and PFR,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and, uh, sometimes as a directing,
some of them will mix in nematodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's some evidence that
nematodes can affect rude aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, there actually is a little bit
of research suggesting that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty limited, but regardless,
um, some combination of root drenches are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically, you know, at least weekly
while you have decent populations of rude
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids and even after that, at least every
other week to keep them suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in combination with that, you need to
be scouting for rude aphids on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the flowers, uh, on the, on the plants
and you need to try to stop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what will happen is then they'll
move down to the roots and then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start another source on your roots on your
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be maintaining your rude
aphids on your source so that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbling out and expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the population stay relatively low,
they'll stay in those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you get large numbers that
they'll start crawling out, producing that
[SPEAKER_00]: your wing forms and then spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you want to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of the bios, um, we know
that, that, um, the, the, the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dwelling predatory beetle, the rose
beetles and, and the predatory mites can
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and do feed on rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they're not going to be an
effective control by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply don't get deep enough into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to help stop your rude
aphids from spreading on the soil surface
[SPEAKER_00]: line and maybe in the top layer,
they're not going to be eliminating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say combining your,
some, some predatory soil insects and
[SPEAKER_00]: mites along with your root drenches is
like a first step for, for rude aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they're one of the most
persistent insects pests have to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with, um, just based on my experience
working with various facilities that are
[SPEAKER_02]: battling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, like you mentioned,
in a lot of cases, it just comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintaining them at a threshold that's
below, you know, an economic, an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold where it's, it's low enough that
we're still getting a good harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting the yields we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant stress isn't necessarily too
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is really hard to get rid of,
especially in facilities where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: reusing media and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good to know that there's some
options there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I mean, that rude aphids,
um, can be controlled with some pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: drenches as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, and, um, they can actually be
relatively effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not clear to me that how many of
these products are going to be registered
[SPEAKER_00]: by your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people will make off-label
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we don't recommend that,
but, um, but there are, and so Boveria is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely one that most cannabis growers
can't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but things like mainspring and
Endeavor can also be somewhat effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not always clear to me if that
they're going to be registered for you by
[SPEAKER_00]: your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you have to look at that,
but, uh, I've certainly seen those things
[SPEAKER_00]: being used as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As drenches, but yeah, your point is once,
once they're established, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get in there early,
um, you may be able to eradicate them from
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility, but, uh, once they're
fairly well established, that can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: that becomes quite hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing you touched on was with
Boveria and I've been having longer
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations with Suzanne and,
um, she's been sharing information with me
[SPEAKER_02]: from some, you know, larger companies that
do pathology and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found with, that there's various
commercially available Boveria and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the products on the market,
um, may not contain a spore level that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's high enough to actually get
suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you want to buy a reputable source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanigard is a great product,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's other ones on there that
may not be as, as effective, or she even
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned there may be a product on the
market where the spore count is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is higher than could physically fit by
volume in the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's a little, you know,
the world of microbials, uh, and
[SPEAKER_02]: biostimulants is a little bit unregulated
still at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you, you want to make sure you're
going to the reputable source there on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Boveria, but it is something that works
really well for dealing with root aphids
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, just a little tidbit I had been
learning about lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's, let's talk about, uh,
what you're most excited about in
[SPEAKER_02]: biocontrols and some of the new stuff that
you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, you know, it's, it's a
fascinating industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of changes going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, where, where I see that,
where I see the biggest, um, adoption,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and growth in the biocontrol market
is, is definitely outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically it was very much a high
value kind of greenhouse house commodity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis is its own course came
along with very few pesticides and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a big adopter of biocontrols and
still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but where I spend most of my attention
these days is, um, on the field outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how can we use some of these
beneficials, um, outdoor for food crop
[SPEAKER_00]: production, you know, in areas where they
really haven't been used before,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least when it comes to putting them on
naturally because they occur naturally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of actually manipulating them
and putting them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple of things that have,
I think driving that one driving that
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the greater availability of
biocontrol agents and more species
[SPEAKER_00]: available than the costs because come down
in some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then another, another technique,
which is open that door is, is the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's now a few companies that
specialize in putting out bugs by drone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers can hire them and they'll pay
on a per acre basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, you can apply biocontrol
agents to a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you could treat a hundred
acres in a matter of an hour or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas there just wouldn't be the
manpower to do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's opening the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I've seen that happen to a certain
extent with, with field grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and hemp, um, not so much where,
where I am, but out West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where there's more field grown hemp
and cannabis, then I know that that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is starting to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I also see, um, more and
more adoption and more and more people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think using biocontrol as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not just throwing a few things on and
then spraying and hoping, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like having a good program and,
and cannabis is, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger cannabis growers now are very
knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they really know what they're doing
and, uh, their, their insect
[SPEAKER_00]: identification skills are good and they,
they understand the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so that's also exciting to see,
cause I think just a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was perhaps a lot less, um,
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I credit Suzanne,
of course, our mutual friend, Suzanne,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's, she's been one of the, um,
leaders in, in getting good information
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, yeah, it's been,
it's, it's, it's been exciting and uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy that our company has been able
to, um, take advantage of, of some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some of this industry, because of
course we will have to make a living,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, there's very few actual
insectaries out there that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: producing bugs, you know, bio B being one
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, there's many,
there's many people like myself that say
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, already do or going to be
like I am distributing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not actually an insect or I'm not
rearing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's actually quite difficult to do
from everything I've learned from Suzanne
[SPEAKER_02]: about the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, one thing to mention when people
are sourcing insects is, is try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them direct from insectary or from a
distributor that's going to ship directly
[SPEAKER_02]: from the insectary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's other distributors that will
receive a larger population of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of insects and then repackage them and
that repackaging, uh, while maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient for smaller growers can reduce
the viability of the insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important that they arrive hungry
and alive so that you get the effects that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to touch on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that definitely, um,
with some of the, um, some of the online,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, sources, which are very easy to find
and very easy to get bugs shipped,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right that they do sometimes
get stored for longer than they,
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting dead bugs is not,
uh, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, you need to have a good
supply, um, and, um, make sure that what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting is good quality and it's,
it's fresh and it's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, w whether you go work directly
with a, with a, with a, with a producer
[SPEAKER_00]: such as ourselves, um, or a distribution
distributor that maybe will drop ship,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, so that you're still getting,
um, material sent directly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so some things store better than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, but when it comes to things
like predatory mites, um, uh, persimilus,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, um, uh, they really need to
be fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them sitting around for
more than a day or two before you use
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, that's a great, that's a
great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's important to work with
someone that can give you the information
[SPEAKER_00]: you need as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a good source of, of, um, fresh
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been slower on, on launching this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm kind of going to time our launch
with this podcast, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges around it because, um,
one it's having a staff that is
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable enough or has the resources
to get the answers, to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations are accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, two it's, you know, having the
relationship with, with like in our case
[SPEAKER_02]: with you guys, to make sure that we are
sending things directly from the
[SPEAKER_02]: insectary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not playing middleman on,
um, receiving packages and sending them
[SPEAKER_02]: back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and then the most challenging
part is the shipping because these things
[SPEAKER_02]: are alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be shipped overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can only ship out on certain days
during the week to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_02]: arrive, um, in a timely fashion and then,
um, having that information for the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they make sure that they know,
you know, they're there to receive the
[SPEAKER_02]: package and know how to apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a lot of steps involved there
and a lot of the cost is shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may pay more in shipping than you
may for the insect itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, trying to coordinate and make sure
that the website can handle all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: has been a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and also make sure that the process
works smoothly so that at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, the customer is getting something
that is going to perform as, as it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if I had to just give one
general tip, um, you know, the people may
[SPEAKER_00]: be out there that are considering using
buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one thing that's really helped that
really helps the process work a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly is, um, you know, rather than
going out scouting on a Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding some bugs and then deciding what,
you know, some pests and then deciding on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, what you're going to put out and
hoping to get them on Wednesday and then
[SPEAKER_00]: being frustrated when you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you can understand what your issues
are historically going to be in that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what are likely to be and come up with
a preventative plan that covers those,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least covers your basic options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add something down the road if
necessary, but, and then work with someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself, um, to determine how many
you need and get that ordered,
[SPEAKER_00]: get that on a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have that ordered every week
or every other week or something based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your production program and,
and get it, get it set up in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that way, once, once you have
that, the, the, the risk of delays,
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of things not being available,
the risk of not being able to get what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need when you want it is so much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a much more reliable
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then just kind of being reactive and
feeling on a, what do I need today kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to set it up as a program to cover
your, at least cover your basics,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your spider mites, your thrips,
if you're going to have them in the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: your fungus net, you know, cover your
basics and, and, uh, set it up as a
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just so much easier for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it comes to shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's a really, really great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, one of the things Suzanne and I
discussed too, was to have an option for
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that I was actually going to,
I was going to talk to you about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, was to set up, uh, a maintenance,
uh, option.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's maybe a combination of a few
different bio controls that would be set
[SPEAKER_02]: up by square footage so that a customer
could go on the website and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred square feet or a thousand square
feet, and then have a given rate or
[SPEAKER_02]: package that we could then recommend based
off of that for, you know, this
[SPEAKER_02]: preventative maintenance sort of,
uh, application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could potentially have a ship,
a central point of being shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could have everything sort
of shipped as one order and then
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed, um, amongst the various
customers potentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would, that would be,
uh, a cheaper way to say you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping lots of little boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're shipping smaller number of larger
boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my thought was, you know,
for a given, let's say just a facility or
[SPEAKER_02]: a given grow would be to have a
combination of a few different insects
[SPEAKER_02]: that I would know fit in a certain size
box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so then I could have the website
calculate accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone could check out by square
footage, for example, um, and not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily have to worry about having to
figure out exactly what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we could give them at least a good
starting preventive program for people who
[SPEAKER_02]: want to start using bio controls that
maybe had a problem and starting a new
[SPEAKER_02]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know that, you know, they're
potentially going to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a historical historically had to
deal with say two spotted or thrips or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can come up with a sort of a
program like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could put out, that would be a little
bit more of a generalist program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea, Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can, we can do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of dropped that on the,
in the middle of a podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm excited, uh, to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I actually talked to Suzanne about
it and she's like, talk to Steven and
[SPEAKER_02]: then, uh, she'll give her a thumb of
approval and we'll get that out on the
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so last thing, if you have time,
I wanted to just really quickly touch on
[SPEAKER_02]: your feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you mentioned, you mentioned it
briefly, and I think it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting, um, that you guys have some
ways to feed the insects, the beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insects that, you know, people may already
have bought or may have naturalized in
[SPEAKER_02]: their area.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would we incorporate that into a
program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I like to do is, uh,
for example, um, when we supply Swirsky,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I like to recommend the Swirsky
version that contains food already,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, simply because I've seen, you know,
it just lasts better on the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it's, uh, you know, you're
providing a food source at the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: put out, you didn't mix anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that would be like an easy way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it can also, that can work with
Oreos as well as Cucumeris as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's really the simplest way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other feed products as well on
the, on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can experiment with, but,
um, I think, you know, people don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do anything that's necessarily more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just get a different bottle
that contains a food source in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and you're working with a crop that's
pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you don't have a whole lot of
pests for your beneficial to feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I find that just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just, it's not a huge cost
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've just seen the results in the
field where it works so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I had, if I had a small grow,
I could order the, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the insects I need, whether that's,
you know, Swirks Geek, Cumeris,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Lacewing Oreos, and then get this,
uh, BioWart feed at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: save on this, you know, massive shipping
cost and maybe keep them alive a little
[SPEAKER_02]: longer by shaking out some of the,
uh, direct, uh, directly applying the
[SPEAKER_02]: feed, you know, to the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to keep the plant, to keep the insects
alive a little longer, I guess is what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extending the time between orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can just buy the feed by
itself and apply some to the crop when
[SPEAKER_00]: you, when you're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're using a blower, you can just
add it to the mix that you're blowing out,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming of what you're blowing out was
compatible with the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, so those are two ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, you know, I would definitely,
I might not necessarily do that in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower because of, you know,
risk of contamination, but definitely in
[SPEAKER_00]: bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're using, if you're putting out
predatory mites and lacewings and Oreos
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that in bed, add a few
dollars and put some of the feed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, it makes a big difference to
the length of time that your buyers can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive and how effective they'll be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already, I've already seen it work
very, very effectively in that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I really appreciate your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already gone longer, but this was
sort of a complicated podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate your time.
