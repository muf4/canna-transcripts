[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do a follow-up to my trivia
post yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the photo in question and you can
see the unique swelling and the nodes on
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like galls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people guessed that it was super
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these plants have never been
super cropped and we do have a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLVD test or HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Hoppe-Layton's viroid that is
supporting this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are familiar now with
Hoppe-Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's becoming more and more
common and I'm happy to do a separate post
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about spread and decontamination
and all of those things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waiting to make this post because I
wanted to get a second confirmation from
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Jack Munns over at Three Rivers
Biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who does our testing for us through
our website and I did do a podcast with
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little while back so you can go
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear more about virus and
virus testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing with the HLVD a variety of
symptoms in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant may appear healthy while the
viroid lays dormant until the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to encounter some sort of
environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see symptoms ranging from loss of
potency, yellowing, misshapen leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: stunting, the plant's inability to support
itself and just a general brittle or weak
[SPEAKER_00]: stem structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the swelling at the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that you are
observant of your plant, that you do
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent testing in order to make sure
that you have confidence in clean
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting findings that is
coming out in research right now and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that I just did a podcast
with Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bug lady, sharing some of the hemp
research that she heard at a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: private hemp conference and that's
essentially that the root tissue may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: more reliable source of viroid testing for
HPLV than the above ground leaf biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the findings were essentially that,
and she gives a number in the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, but essentially many of the
plants tested negative for the viroid when
[SPEAKER_00]: they tested the leaf tissue and then they
would test the root tissue and they found
[SPEAKER_00]: that the roots would test, the root
samples would test positive, whereas none
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants where the roots tested
negative did the leaf tissue test
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of reasons there to test
the root tissue to get a more reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: result potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was really interesting
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That interview is already available on our
new Patreon the raw footage, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual podcast interview will be coming
out probably this week or next week at the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are interested, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can try and track down more information
about this viroid, viral disinfection,
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices and put together another
post or even maybe another podcast around
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reach out if you have any questions
and just wanted to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that participate,
I just want to say thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the guess is or the comment,
it's really about just going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: mental process of thinking about how to
approach your garden, what some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables are, what some of the things it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, if you get it wrong,
don't sweat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get these things wrong all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm constantly learning and I hope we can
all continue to learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
Thank you.
