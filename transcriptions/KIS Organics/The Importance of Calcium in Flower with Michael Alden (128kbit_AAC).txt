[SPEAKER_00]: My lab mate, Melissa Munoz, she did her
doctorate work with calcium sprays and
[SPEAKER_00]: different pesticide sprays for preventing
botrytis on rose, I think herb or daisy
[SPEAKER_00]: and something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what she found is that if you spray
calcium onto the flower tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can help reduce botrytis infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to try that with
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue was that by the time you were
spraying it, by the time you actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: these well-developed inflorescences and
they're kind of in that time where
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis can start infecting and becoming
a problem, it's too late to be applying
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really get it into the flowers
like you can with a rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you do it with a rose is that
you just turn it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dunk it into a solution of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with a cannabis plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea instead is that what we
need to do is that you can't really spray
[SPEAKER_00]: late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to be doing is providing
higher calcium and potentially silica
[SPEAKER_00]: right from the start of flowering or even
beforehand and maintain very, very high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of calcium and silica in
the plant to potentially reduce botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have data for that or anything,
but what we know for sure is that spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: either pesticides or calcium late into
flowering does nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
