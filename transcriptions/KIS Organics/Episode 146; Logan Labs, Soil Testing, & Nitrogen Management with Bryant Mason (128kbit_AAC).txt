[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had Bryant on the podcast a few times
in the past and he's one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bryant is a certified crop advisor who
specializes in organic cannabis nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has spent the last eight years working
to combine precision laboratory techniques
[SPEAKER_01]: with data science in an effort to unravel
the complexities of cannabis soil and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with his work on soilless media,
he also helps outdoor cultivators around
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States with nutrient management
and cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to do soil testing,
help interpreting a soil test,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are interested in an online course on
these subjects, his website is www
[SPEAKER_01]: .soiledoctorconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to save $100 on his
course, you can use the discount code
[SPEAKER_01]: KISORGANICS, all one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken his course and was recently
going back to review some of the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's excellent and I highly recommend it
for anyone wanting to do a deep dive on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis fertility and reusing your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now after recording the podcast with
Bryant, he had a couple of points he
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a short addendum that I added
in at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn it back on and talk a
little bit more about some of these topics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we covered in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just dive right into the first part,
which is where we discussed Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the questions I'm seeing from
my most recent post on social media is,
[SPEAKER_01]: do we need to retest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these tests that we got during this
period, which we'll get into a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: detail with here as you listen to the
podcast, are these tests erroneous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can we still utilize that data?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the data on those tests is
totally accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, the soil report,
what I call the standard test,
[SPEAKER_00]: is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the paste information is
accurate or fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been telling growers,
at least in the period of time where
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, chloride, and a few of the cations
were elevated, is really if your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look good, and you're not seeing any
problems related to salt stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there really isn't any need to
retest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just retest at your normal
interval, and you'll see the updated,
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take those numbers with a grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the interpretation,
if you're seeing really, really high
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, I would suggest not leaching and
just sort of ignoring them for the time
[SPEAKER_00]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something we just talked about
off air, but essentially, this is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so typically if we see high ECE,
high soluble salts from, I know you listed
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, I'm thinking more of like
chloride, sodium, nitrates, then you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: typically recommend leaching the beds to
reduce those numbers down to a better
[SPEAKER_01]: level, to reduce osmotic pressure on the
root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easier for the plants to take up
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if your plants look great,
and you're not seeing that reflected,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's showing on the test reflected in
your plants, what's your recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a good nuance to cover
because I have thresholds at which I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is we're trying to optimize,
even if the plants are relatively healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can reduce the osmotic stress to the
roots, you can have better, healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are higher yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a line between what's
operationally feasible and the marginal
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in plant health that really
has to be an onsite decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plants look healthy and you're
very satisfied with the production,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you may not need to leach even when
there's a leaching recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just really sort of a grower
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'd say that if you see any poor
plant health or negative symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would absolutely recommend leaching
when levels are high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't a magic number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have thresholds where if you
were at 300 chlorides, we would recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching at 300 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if your plants look great and
you're not seeing any visual symptoms and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaching is obviously a lot of work,
it's a lot of water, it's labor intensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's material intensive in terms of the
amount of water you have to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't necessarily have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no magic number that above that
number, your plants are gonna look like
[SPEAKER_01]: crap and suffer, or below that number,
your plants are gonna be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just what we've seen based on
looking at hundreds, if not thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: these soil tests and sort of where we
think that this level sort of exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a very arbitrary number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the reason that there's not a
hard and fast number is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: osmotic problem gets worse when
evaporation rates are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high temperature, high airflow,
high radiation is when the plant needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be uptaking more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so oftentimes that higher EC is
preventing it from doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start to see issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental conditions are going
to, in many ways, determine when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are actually suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: From osmotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another reason these numbers
are a little loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in the winter and it's
temperatures are depressed or the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, your PPFD is a little lower,
your evaporation, your total evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: is just on the lower side, then you might
be able to get away with quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher levels of salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's sort of have to determine
how your plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the possibility of sampling error
here, where if a small amount of fish bone
[SPEAKER_01]: meal or alfalfa meal or whatever organic
amendment, gypsum, ends up in your tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: sample, that could dramatically skew your
results and show numbers that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than what's actually in your soil
or reflected in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the things that you
mentioned in this podcast is later on is
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil is not homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think of it as homogenous, but really
it's not homogenous at all, even with
[SPEAKER_01]: these potting soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through no fault of the lab,
potentially the results could be skewed
[SPEAKER_01]: just from sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sometimes have that concern with
nitrogen because it's on the soil report
[SPEAKER_00]: and the scoop size is quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to most of the soluble
salts, I'm looking at them on the paste
[SPEAKER_00]: report and the sample size is a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does help eliminate a small chunk
of one thing or the other, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample is quite large when we're looking
at the paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a valid point to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, when we are talking
about pH reactions, that's really where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's these very small, there's a
non-homogenous soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's small pockets of low pH,
high pH, the rise of spheres different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulk soil pH is a bit of a misnomer in
the sense that there's just many different
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets of different chemistry in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good transition into the
conversation that we had on the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a couple of things that you
wanted to go back and clarify around that
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to share that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung up after the initial podcast and I
thought, you know, my answer to your
[SPEAKER_00]: question on how nitrogen amendments
affects pH wasn't totally precise when I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about the nitrogen conversion
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nitrogen mineralizes from organic
nitrogen to ammonium, there's a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in pH because the ammonia
combines with a hydrogen ion to create
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that consumes a hydrogen ion and that
will therefore increase the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in that second part of the nitrogen
conversion process, when ammonium goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, there's actually a decrease in pH
and that's because it goes to nitrite and
[SPEAKER_00]: then to nitrate and in both of those
steps, hydrogen ions are released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to acidify the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a slightly acidifying
effect when organic nitrogen converts to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that there's a net zero effect in
the pH change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so technically the nitrogen conversion
process acidifying, but the reason that I
[SPEAKER_00]: generally don't see a pH change in living
soils is because there's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of the characteristics of the
amendment that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, when alfalfa meal
mineralizes, there's a number of base
[SPEAKER_00]: cations that are contributing,
that are contributed to the soil that more
[SPEAKER_00]: than offset the acidity contributed by the
nitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now other amendments, and I use this
example to you as cottonseed meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: not that many people use cottonseed meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contributes a lot of sulfur and not
many base cations, so it can have a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: acidity acidifying effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of these are sort of independent
from the nitrogen conversion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the pH effect from nitrogen
conversion and then there's the pH effect
[SPEAKER_00]: from the actual characteristics in the
chemistry of the amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those are different and that's
ultimately what's going to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: net pH change when you apply a nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see generally is not much
change in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason is living soils have more
buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is slight downward pressure or
upward pressure from the amendment being
[SPEAKER_00]: applied, the soil is often buffering that
and there's not a huge change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's always exceptions
and I think a lot of it depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of mineralization and the quantity of
amendment being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I said, which amendment you
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying essentially something
like a fishbone meal is giving you more
[SPEAKER_01]: than just nitrogen conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also giving you calcium or magnesium
or these other cations that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put upward pressure on pH, therefore sort
of neutralizing the effects of this
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen cycling that's occurring from a
pH perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the reason I asked this
question, what I was thinking in my head
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't fully explain this,
was if I already have a freshly mixed soil
[SPEAKER_01]: where that nitrogen is in the form of
ammonium and in my head I'm thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, that's going to be, if anything,
raising pH slightly because it's showing
[SPEAKER_01]: as ammonium and my pH is 6,261.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that ammonium converts, my pH is
certainly not going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it may drop a point or
slightly depending on how these other
[SPEAKER_01]: factors come into play and like you
mentioned, the buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my expectation is that pH is going to
maintain or drop and it's already low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to wait to take the soil test
after, you know, wait for that nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle and I do sometimes see the pH drop a
little bit because on the flip side when I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a very high pH, you know,
if I were to test the soil right away and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 7,3 I might see it drop down just
slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to keep in mind that this
conversion process is actually happening
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously and you're at different
steps in the process, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the different particles of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when ammonium is elevating,
yeah, you're seeing the pH go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's also
ammonium going to nitrate that's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can never really pinpoint what's
going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you're saying is accurate
is just wait, just wait till it cooks or
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralizes whatever you want to say and
sort of levels out wherever it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you want to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing you mentioned later in
the podcast, just for folks that you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't mention just now, is that there is
this organic pool of nitrogen and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: explain more about that later in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people who are just listening,
I don't want you to think we're ignoring a
[SPEAKER_01]: major source of nitrogen here in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just hyper focused on this one
aspect of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't quite elaborate on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was one other topic that
you wanted to just offer some
[SPEAKER_01]: clarification around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, I'm not as informed around
environmental controls and some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let you just kind of
explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just sort of explaining a
scenario in which it's possible to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: your greenhouse by venting even if the
outside air is warmer than the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which sounds it's completely
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds impossible, but you can bring in
warmer air and it can actually cool your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that's possible is because
temperature changes when there's a change
[SPEAKER_00]: in total energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, the temperature of your
greenhouse will only change if the
[SPEAKER_00]: enthalpy increases or decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enthalpy is a combination of
temperature and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say it's super hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 97 degrees Fahrenheit and very
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your greenhouse is slightly cooler,
maybe 95 degrees Fahrenheit and 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you vent, the temperature in your
greenhouse will actually drop because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reduction in enthalpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one very niche example of
what I was explaining has been kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing my mind as I go deeper into the
science of energy balance and ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for clarifying those points
and coming back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope folks continue to listen as we
start the rest of the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Bryant, you're a popular guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming back on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, for people who are unfamiliar,
please do go back and check out the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous podcasts that I've done with
Bryant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get an idea of some of the
things we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some new topics for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's just start off talking about
Logan Labs a little bit and lab testing in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just to throw it out there,
I know you found some inconsistencies in
[SPEAKER_01]: the test results starting around in
August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd seen some things, too,
on my end that were often we'd both
[SPEAKER_01]: reached out to Logan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to each other about this and
some other people had reached out to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just give us a little more context
of what was going on and where to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, in August, of 2024,
I saw a number of tests that were all very
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated in sulfur on the saturated pace
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soluble sulfur and abnormally high
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pretty much within a day or two,
I told the lab and this type of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happens occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lab is very responsive to this
type of feedback because I'm looking at so
[SPEAKER_00]: many tests and I'm one of their partner
agronomists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they jumped on it and they brought
in what's called an ICP technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ICP is the advanced piece of equipment
that actually looks and determines
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the technician serviced the
instrument, calibrated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went through multiple sort of steps
in QC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, the issue seemed to
persist for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been thinking about it and
working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly throughout the months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a while to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, I can just tell you so we
can jump into what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you do, can you just talk about
what the issue was that we were that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were all seeing on our test results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly elevated levels of sulfur,
but also slightly elevated levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride and a few of the cations,
calcium, magnesium, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although those were less so than sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that higher sulfur and chloride
number, the soluble salts number was
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore a little bit higher because
that's one of the components of soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that led to was not necessarily an
over application of anything, but rather
[SPEAKER_00]: an under application in certain instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as someone writing
recommendations, I would see high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started, for example,
suggesting potassium silicate instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium sulfate in some instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use what I call a governor in the
soil doctor tool algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a car has a governor that prevents
you from going too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I essentially stopped the use of gypsum
and potassium sulfate above very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very elevated levels of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in really high EC situations,
some of the recommendations didn't include
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum or potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final thing which we've
discussed is in some instances,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling growers to leach their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially to flush the excess levels
of chloride, sulfur, and I guess sodium as
[SPEAKER_00]: a fourth cation, I didn't mention out of
their soil to reduce the EC to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the substantial things that
were happening in the recommendations due
[SPEAKER_00]: to these elevated levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to be clear, that was not happening
in all or even most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, but definitely in some
instances that was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to add a couple of just a
little bit more context here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and you already know this, but for
folks who are unfamiliar, sulfur in
[SPEAKER_01]: general is a pretty safe mineral in the
sense that high levels of sulfur are not
[SPEAKER_01]: really having negative impacts on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to see a sulfur toxicity
per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue there is it's going to raise the
EC or the soluble salt level of your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially lead to a little bit more
osmotic pressure on the roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: making it harder for your roots have to
work harder to pull nutrients up versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly lower EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the issue with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with the chlorides, I just want to
emphasize that for folks that may have
[SPEAKER_01]: been given a flushing recommendation,
that doesn't mean they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were at zero chlorides or 100
chlorides and all of a sudden it's
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting 400 plus chlorides and you're
having to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are probably test results where you
were borderline or on your way to needing
[SPEAKER_01]: to flush anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the worst thing, but obviously
not ideal either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be as targeted and accurate
with these tests as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really well said,
especially on the sulfur front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also add that for years I've been
trying to figure out how to organically
[SPEAKER_00]: push calcium and potassium levels high
without spiking the EC and the soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, which is a very difficult challenge
because we're using large quantities of
[SPEAKER_00]: just gypsum and potassium sulfate in some
instances, langbenite, a lot of sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: containing amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, sometimes leaching is a
really great thing because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of pushing levels down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when I saw this, I changed my
recommendations a bit, my thresholds,
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting certain leaching thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was some self-correction
along the way because this has been going
[SPEAKER_00]: on for several months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that's a little background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about what the actual issue
was and how that relates to Logan and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's even specific to Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and this is where I've spent a lot of
time is not only figuring out the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, but just sort of putting the
solution in a larger framework of is this
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan specific, is it lab specific,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened is Logan actually has
really vigorous quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recalibrate their ICP every 20
samples, which is far more than most labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some labs do it twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some labs do it every hundred samples,
but every 20 samples is very rigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do that, they use what's
called a standard, which is a calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that's provided by the ICP
company or technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, they were sold a
standard solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a low end standard solution and
a high end solution to tell the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: what's low, what's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are known values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high end solution, they were sold
a bad solution that was overly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were calibrating that ICP machine
to the wrong standard because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: sold the wrong liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really tough thing to figure
out because they're continually
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibrating, they're cleaning
everything, they're troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the known standard that's supposed to
be ground truth was off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so unfortunately, it was just
calibrating to the high side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention that any soils that were low,
usually traditionally top soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's low in soluble salts
really didn't have this issue because that
[SPEAKER_00]: lower standard was accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I love Logan and
working with Logan is they participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: something called the NAPT North American
Proficiency Testing Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there's 150 participating labs
and it's a quality control level between
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do a quarterly blind or double
blind statistical evaluation of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and water samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's essentially, you know,
they're given a sample, they run it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then this NAPT program tells them how
close they are, how precise they are to
[SPEAKER_00]: the known levels and they compare it
across 150 labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Logan always has an extremely precise
score.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that's always given me
confidence with Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is those samples are top soil,
they're low in nutrient concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with peat-based medias that
often were really pushing nutrition and EC
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kept passing NAPT, but that's
because it was on that, it was a low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration sample and we were seeing
these issues in high concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: high EC soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those unfamiliar as well with ICP
machines, you know, we're talking parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million here, parts per billion in
some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're extremely, I guess,
accurate in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we're talking about such small
amounts, there's just greater opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: for sampling error and for other things
too to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I always try to
emphasize with the growers we work with is
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have a test result that is just
really far off the standard that we expect
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be, then we can always, you know,
we can always ask Logan to retest it or we
[SPEAKER_01]: can assume that maybe something got into
that sample to contaminate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there was a piece of like fishbone
meal for example, that was undissolved and
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up in there and suddenly our
phosphorus levels are just through the
[SPEAKER_01]: roof and our pH has dropped dramatically
or, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always good to take these tests,
I think, with a small grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're the most useful tool that
we have agronomically for making data
[SPEAKER_01]: driven decisions about our garden and
about our soil, but it's still not perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's never going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on that note, I think,
OK, well, so Logan had this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really their fault, but
unfortunately it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about switching to another lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this could have happened in any lab,
so it's not necessarily unique to them in
[SPEAKER_01]: that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to switch labs,
like I know that's something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you and I talked about, like, what does
that really look like for a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing it does mean is you're
really, you're starting over in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take your old Logan tests and
then correlate them with your new tests at
[SPEAKER_01]: the other, the next lab you go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many labs out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever lab you go with, you kind of
need to stay with because these test
[SPEAKER_01]: results don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like apples to oranges, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to share a little bit
more around this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, anything you want to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to add one thing,
which is that these issues actually happen
[SPEAKER_00]: at all labs, unfortunately, and you just
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason I've personally
committed deeply to Logan A is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can really calibrate to one lab and
have a very extensive database that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I can see these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so familiar with the data,
their process, the people in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that when these issues do
arise, I can see them and identify them
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know, part of the,
even though it took a long time to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem, I was able to help them solve
that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's sort of, it's been a sort of a
mutual and collaborative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to another lab and you're
just doing, you know, let's say one to
[SPEAKER_00]: even up to a hundred tests per year,
you're not, you're not going to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not going to know when
issues arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me and the growers I work with,
I think there's actually a major benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: to being deeply committed and involved
with one lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to be involved in
this, so that I don't have to spend a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time with that, I can be part of one
lab's dataset because at least I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would guess we see probably about a
thousand tests a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing you're significantly higher
than that with the number of growers you
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you do have this database that
builds up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, if you suddenly see a 20%
increase in, in your soluble salts across
[SPEAKER_01]: all your tests, starting on this date,
That's a really good clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're working with Logan for
instituting even more additional controls
[SPEAKER_01]: to hopefully catch these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can recalibrate the machine over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's still giving high levels,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually went back into our
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So internally, we anonymously put all the
tests into a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we essentially ran statistics
looking at the average levels before and
[SPEAKER_00]: after August of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trend was clear, specifically with
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at the variation between
months, et cetera, with statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm working with them to actually
institute another step of QC where they
[SPEAKER_00]: look at their own internal database and
they just see how close it is month to
[SPEAKER_00]: month or quarter to quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when these issues arise,
they can just look straight to the
[SPEAKER_00]: database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of continuing to try to figure out
the equipment malfunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if folks have questions about this,
I'd say feel free to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you can reach out to you,
Brian or even Logan directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this issue has been corrected as of
what date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mid-March.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to go back and look at the exact
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you see, you know,
if you have a test and you're thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is chloride 450 ppm?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been quite a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your test result was before mid-March.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably, if they still have
your sample, they could rerun it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, anything after mid-March
will be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I've gotten some questions
around, well, how can I still use these
[SPEAKER_00]: tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would just look at specifically
sulfur and chloride with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can assume, you know, on average,
looking at a few thousand samples before
[SPEAKER_00]: August of 2024 and about a thousand after
the other cations are, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, but let's just say 25%
elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to change your
management decisions very dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still use the data and most of
the data is still very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote a lot of really good
recommendations with very small things I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that may have been different,
but the data is still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take it with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good news in this is if anything,
you might have under-applied nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is always vastly preferred over
over-applying nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I saw the trend go in the other
direction, where I was seeing things
[SPEAKER_00]: weight artificially low, leading to
excessive high application rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have taken much more aggressive
action because that's such a higher risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead we kind of took the slow
route, didn't sort of overreact and
[SPEAKER_00]: figured it out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just want to say that I think you
and I both are huge believers in
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're actually talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to know this because
ultimately I feel like that is what builds
[SPEAKER_00]: trust and credibility as opposed to
covering things up, which again is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens in other labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see internal issues and they fix
them, but they don't really say anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we were both eager to actually
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I want to be clear because there
were a couple of growers who reached out
[SPEAKER_01]: to me directly, and I was not aware of the
full solution until very recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: within the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I knew prior to that date was I
had reached out to Susan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had scheduled a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through sort of their protocols
and how they do these tests, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned some things in that process,
which was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, they hadn't changed any of
their staffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hadn't changed any of their
procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you had talked to me prior to,
you know, our conversation, Bryant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a week ago, whenever that was,
I would have told you that, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as I know, I'm not aware of any
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is this is where we're at with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have seen some inconsistencies with
higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do know that there's some people
that have been pretty vocal about this on
[SPEAKER_01]: online and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little bit of vindication for
them, but also I want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're approaching it in a way that's
solution driven, I guess, so we can all
[SPEAKER_01]: continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on, you brought up you mentioned
nitrogen, and I just want to talk a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to I know we have a list here
we're working off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, before we dive into your topic
on nitrogen, I wanted to say, can we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit about how nitrogen cycles and
how we see it on the soil tests and its
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know that the cannabis wants
nitrogen in the form of nitrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we first add compost,
we first mix our soil soils, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see a low nitrate number and a high
what we would consider a high ammonium
[SPEAKER_01]: number, not high relative to the nitrate
number ammonium, you know, maybe like a
[SPEAKER_01]: three or six or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how does that how does that cycling
process really work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the impact and implications
for a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the most part, growers and living
soil organic growers are are only applying
[SPEAKER_00]: organic forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen in the form of proteins and amino
acids, but let's just say soybean meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa meal, blood meal, all these are
actually full proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology in the soil mineralizes those
organic forms of nitrogen into smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take a protein, they turn into
amino acid, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant actually can't uptake those
organic forms of nitrogen and it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary form of nitrogen that's uptaken
even in organic soils where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding amino acids and organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a plant available form of
nitrogen that's very, very beneficial when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant does uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically skipped in the
scientific literature because most I'd say
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 percent of studies use the inorganic
forms, which are ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our systems, the plants,
we can assume the plants are uptaking a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of organic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's turned into organic nitrogen,
a different set of biology transforms it
[SPEAKER_00]: into ammonium very, very quickly in a
warm, moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transition happens very, very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a different set of bacteria
convert the ammonium into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrate is the final form.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the organic nitrogen we apply to
the soil eventually ends up as nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty quick transition from
ammonium to nitrate as well in,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, with the conditions we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sort of see where your soil is
in that mineralization process based on
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of ammonium, that middle step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weakness of soil testing is it doesn't
show us the entire quantity of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only seeing those final two pools of
nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sort of gauge how much nitrogen
is in the soil just based on ammonium and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how mineralized it is
based on how low ammonium is and how high
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, essentially what we're doing is
we're just throwing nitrogen into the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic bucket and the biology is
transforming it pretty quickly into the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I see ammonium, let's say over two
or three PPM, I can assume that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of nitrogen previously applied
fairly recently and it's still moving into
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true that you definitely... So let's
say we were in a hydro system and you fed
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% ammonium, ammonium sulfate or
something, versus 100% nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know, let's just say calcium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant absolutely will perform
better in the nitrate scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soils we're working in,
again, they have a lot of access to amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids and small organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ammonium tends to be pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen or the nitrate tends to be
pretty high just because that conversion
[SPEAKER_00]: process is happening so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in organic systems, you don't really
have much control over whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen's in the ammonium or nitrate form
other than time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wait longer and it'll all convert
to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a couple other things around that
that I'd like to add is, so we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: organic pool of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially tied up within the
microorganisms, within the organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: within these fertilizers that we're adding
and it's being converted or cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: that are breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things are going to have
nitrogen that's going to slowly be
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the organic pool of nitrogen
that we can't really measure as
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're referring to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it converts to ammonium,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, ammonium, and this is where I want to
get some clarification from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ammonium would put upward pressure on our
pH, whereas nitrate, being an anion,
[SPEAKER_01]: would put negative downward pressure on
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I see ammonium levels on soil
tests is typically when people mix a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and then send it in for a test right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when they add compost or organic matter
that's not fully composted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the implications of that is our
nitrates and our nitrogen recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: is just going to be a little bit harder to
dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, what we like to do with our
soil tests is we mix the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wait two to three weeks, and let me
emphasize, in warm conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did this in the winter in a pile
outside, that nitrogen's not converting at
[SPEAKER_01]: a very quick, very fast rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to switch to nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we wait two to three weeks and then
send in our soil test, the result we get
[SPEAKER_01]: back is going to be more accurate in terms
of our nitrate levels, which will allow us
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a better decision about where
we're at for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would assume, and this is where I
want your clarification, I would assume
[SPEAKER_01]: our pH would be a little more accurate
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and I talked about this and you
didn't feel like it changed pH as much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel like I've seen that a little
bit on tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in a living soil, well,
first of all, there's way more buffering
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also these transitions happen quickly
and sort of non-homogeneously in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, in theory, if you put down a large
application of a fast-releasing nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: source, that first conversion will drop
the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you test it in the middle of,
like you amended the soil, immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: took a test, you might see a dip in pH,
especially in a soil that sort of doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, if you wait a few weeks...
A drop or a raise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you see a raise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so you would see an increase at
first and then a drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but again, I don't actually see that
in most peat-based soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't... I can't even think of an
instance when I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's because I'm telling
people to wait and to let the full
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion process happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also just think that I'm not even
sure in most soils that that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: visual, maybe a couple tenths of a pH
drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing significant pH drops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the soil's at a 6.8 and it drops to a
5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.5, that type of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to say because I don't
see enough tests, like in a row,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks apart or three weeks apart to
where I can really say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see a... I do worry that if I see
a high ammonium number and I know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: conferred in nitrates and I'm already at a
low pH, 6.3 or something, I'm worried that
[SPEAKER_01]: that pH as those nitrates mineralize could
potentially drop further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're less concerned about that,
but it's something I was thinking of.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do want to highlight though
that you said is that these soils are not
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're acting like soil is homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these different pockets of pHs
and mineralization and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: availability, microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that's important for
people to try and keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like visualizing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like we can fully...
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the other thing with this
nitrogen conversion, especially when we
[SPEAKER_01]: add nutrients to the soil, if we add a
large amount of fertility, we really have
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat it like a like a thermophilic
compost in the sense that that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially is going to heat up because
the bacteria is reproducing so rapidly as
[SPEAKER_01]: they get this food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concern with that is that it's
going to make it inhospitable to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: roots or less hospitable to plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another reason when I see a
higher ammonium number, I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, let's not plant yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to let the soil cycle a little
further to allow this nitrogen to convert,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure the soil temperature is good,
not too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that nitrogen... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when a soil heats up, it's just
tons of cellular respiration happening
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bacteria primarily, and they're
actually consuming a lot of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my fear is you're just planting into a
low oxygen environment because the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are using so much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you mentioned previously,
definitely a really young plant isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want a high ammonium nitrogen
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weighting is preferable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to emphasize, when you put
it in an organic nitrogen, the net change
[SPEAKER_00]: in pH should be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you're going to get a fluctuation,
boop, boop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that conversion process is quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to try to manage the pH during that
blip of time doesn't make sense to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because it should start at seven and end
at seven, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were using... If you use a
non-organic form of nitrogen, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're primarily talking about organic
amendments here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess the context for me is more
like I see a soil test on freshly mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that is a low pH, high ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry that it may drop a little further
because we don't know where we're starting
[SPEAKER_01]: with that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, like you said, with re-amendment
with nitrogen, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing that you also wanted to
talk about was why nitrogen targets in
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil that's being used multiple
rounds might be different than other
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is something that I think is an
important point that I've thought about a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, honestly, for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soil fresh out of the bag, my target
level of nitrogen, which should totally be
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the soil volume per plant,
the length of time the plant is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, how much supplemental feeding is
done, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, speaking, 100 to 150 ppm of
nitrate nitrogen, low ammonium shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil is fully mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good target number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I test a fresh kiss soil,
it's somewhere approximately in that
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just add actually one nuance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing a fresh soil out of the bag is
going to be less accurate than testing a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil after it's been through a round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just always less homogeneous,
even if you mix it super, super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But point being, if you're somewhere in
that, let's say 100 ppm 125 ppm range,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens though, if you use the soil,
let's say 10 rounds in a row, is every
[SPEAKER_00]: round you're applying more organic
nitrogen, more alfalfa meal, more compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: more granular poultry manure, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of that nitrogen in those
amendments and that compost does get
[SPEAKER_00]: broken down within a round, but a lot of
it remains because of two things,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon and nitrogen ratio and the
particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put drop a wood chip into the
soil, that's going to take a fairly long
[SPEAKER_00]: time to mineralize and to decompose in
your soil compared to a tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: particle of blood meal, which is really,
really high in nitrogen, low in carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: has a small particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you put in all this organic nitrogen
over time, not all of it's releasing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to build this reservoir of
organic nitrogen that's releasing slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over many rounds, you actually have
this large reservoir of nitrogen that is
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing slowly that we're not seeing on
a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in general, I think growers who are
on multiple rounds in the same soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to lower their nitrogen target well
below 125 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten feedback from growers who
are in around 25 that my nitrogen target
[SPEAKER_00]: feels a little too high in their soils and
that they're actually getting really good
[SPEAKER_00]: results and their plants are finishing at
a coloration they like, a greenness level
[SPEAKER_00]: they like with much, much lower levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that's because they have
25 rounds of alfalfa meal application
[SPEAKER_00]: that's still slowly mineralizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in agronomy, you assume
that 50% of a compost would become
[SPEAKER_00]: available in year one, 25 the next year,
25% the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can sort of think of it as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's sort of a staggering release
rate across some of these amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would expect release rates to be
faster in soilless media because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: more biology, warmer temperatures and
controlled environment agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the principle of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think of that 50, 25, 25,
as a principle and not as a rule to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soils we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have a lot to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really interesting and I
think that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do, you know, we see the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nice thing about nitrogen is it's
pretty easy to add and it's pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: visually see symptoms of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the easiest deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and maybe even toxicity to really
see in your plants and too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to you're going to have
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see the clying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see, you know,
lower yields, potentially greater pest
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really having proper levels of nitrogen
is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you need to add nitrogen,
I mean, fish hydrolysis, it's probably my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite quick liquid feed that's
affordable and not, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a marketing branded product,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of two options I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also say that to me, the best bet,
the best way to create your own internal
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen targets, internal meaning in your
own operation is to is to just judge your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they fade to too fast and too early or
are they too green and too vegetative too
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy at harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and look at where your nitrogen is and
kind of adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people this all the time where it's
like, I'm going to recommend a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of nitrogen to hit the nitrogen
target, but ultimately you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: reading your plants like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just where your last round
ended is the best metric for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my last round, which I shared on
Instagram with people want to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I felt like I finished a little high
in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll I'll go through, get the test,
get the recommendation, and then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably take my nitrogen target and
adjust it down by exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll still work off the same target
and then I'll just lower it and then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see how that round goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's if it's still high,
you know, if it's high, then I can adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: it down further or if it starts to get low
and I find I have to apply something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, you know, you could look
at is blood meal would be another pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: fast nitrogen source that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you can just make adjustments
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's not on your list of
topics, but something I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about because I've been thinking a lot
about it lately is is rock dust in living
[SPEAKER_01]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know certain mixes like the Coot mix,
for example, recommends pretty high levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are always worried about
getting their trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my lately, the way I've been
approaching it is one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: particle size is king here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller the particle size,
the sooner these, you know, these rock
[SPEAKER_01]: dust will become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of time it would take for
the microbes to break it down for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any sort of weathering and
mineralization is not a timeline that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want for like production cannabis just
because it's such an unknown variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I worry that all of these rock
dust are bringing in some level of heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just so hypervigilant about heavy
metals these days with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with law facilities that are
regulated for it that I'm more inclined to
[SPEAKER_01]: lean towards sulfates or, you know,
just a tiny amount of rock dust,
[SPEAKER_01]: a tiny amount of kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend rock dust or kelp meal
in cannabis production, primarily for a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern around heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I do not see them as a
replacement for micronutrient sulfates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say micronutrients,
I'm talking about the five essential
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients, iron, manganese,
zinc, copper, and boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dozens of non-essential trace
minerals that are brought in with rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust and kelp meal that the plant doesn't
need, but in theory would make it
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger, could be a biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could feed biology, could make some kind
of expression happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But personally, I've used rock dust and
kelp meal for over a decade in my own
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen amazing crop responses
or any, I've actually never seen anything
[SPEAKER_00]: from rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen stuff from kelp meal,
but kelp meal also has a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in it and quite a bit of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tough to know exactly where that
response is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you apply these products
for the non-essential trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never gonna get a high enough
quantity of the five essential
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may help, they may be
biostimulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally don't hurt, except when
they're used in high quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can run into issues with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not adamantly against them,
but I think that growers often want to
[SPEAKER_00]: skip the micronutrient sulfates,
the iron sulfate, manganese sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble or that type of stuff and use rock
dust instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not a one-to-one
replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also mention that growers don't
like the micronutrient sulfates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I sort of understand why
intuitively, if you use them and you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at them, they just don't feel that
natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put them in a living soil feels
weird, especially copper sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got that weird blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally they express that concern
around sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're applying orders of magnitude more
sulfur with the use of gypsum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not melanized in cannabis
production to the same extent the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient sulfates are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to minimize sulfur,
you really have to sort of eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum and potassium sulfate and
langbenite and epsom salt way before you
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm recommending at two teaspoons,
just very tiny quantities, just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of grams in an entire cubic yard of soil
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's why I don't recommend rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you are getting trace minerals
from your compost fraction in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: too, that's probably- And all the other
amendments from bone meals and anything
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ocean has a huge amount of these
trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, alfalfa meal, it's got it all in
really small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally the trace minerals that
aren't essential, if they're gonna work,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're gonna do anything, they're
needed in extremely small quantities
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be in these soils that were
amending heavily and that have tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be plenty of these trace
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that said, I may be a little bit of a
hypocrite because before I planted a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand trees on my farm, I definitely
threw in a little bit of just small,
[SPEAKER_00]: small quantity of rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's mostly because I just
had it lying around and I wanted to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not bet a dollar that it's
actually doing anything to my trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can disagree with me and that's
totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I'm just speaking to my own
experience here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did some trials when we were
creating our nutrient pack and I had long
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations with Coote back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some trials at the local
horticulture college and one of them on
[SPEAKER_01]: his recommendation was high levels of rock
dust for the re-amendment with the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting these trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically there just was inadequate
fertility because there was no available
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've kind of moved away from rock dust
philosophically for the same reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: you're listing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought it was, I thought it
was an interesting topic because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been asking me about azomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Kelmiel definitely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelmiel has all kinds of bio-stimulating
effects and hormonal effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it has nitrogen and a lot
of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kelmiel is a more complicated topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also much more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, the rate, you know,
the dose makes the poison and the rate for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason, Kelmiel rates in cannabis
production are just generally too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also bringing in a ton of sodium
and chloride if you apply it in really
[SPEAKER_00]: high quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less is more with Kelmiel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as clearly, I'm not anti Kelmiel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think you want to watch the
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just, you know, there's a lot of
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting tested, you don't
want to use it in high quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any bio-stimulant should be acting in
a very low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: One note to add to all this is if you do
want to play around with these
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient sulfates, I would highly
suggest you don't add anything without a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test to go off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do add anything, we are talking
minute amounts because you can absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: screw up your soil with toxicities by
adding too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really have to know what you're
doing because like solu-bor, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: is significantly stronger than borax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you screw up for some reason and
grab solu-bor on a borax recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can way overdo your boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be careful playing mad scientist
with micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a spectrum within them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply quite a bit of ferrous iron
sulfate, but not so much copper or boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of run through it,
when I use micronutrient sulfates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I dissolve them in water at a carbon
source of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically that's a humic substance,
like a dissolvable humic acid or molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe to go back to this conversation,
kelp is a source of carbon, so just a
[SPEAKER_00]: touch of kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always apply it in water
because it's distributed more evenly than
[SPEAKER_00]: you never apply them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I inject it into my irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the theory there is you may be
chelating a little bit with a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also buffering it biologically a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're giving the microbes something to
eat with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the microbes consume the carbon or
the sugar source, they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating those micronutrients into
their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that keeps those micronutrients in a
more plant-available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're essentially taking an
inorganic salt and turning it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue with some of these,
like iron sulfate specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a little bit manganese sulfate too,
is redox matters a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just drench iron sulfate
straight into a soil with a pH over six or
[SPEAKER_00]: six five, it'll immediately oxidize and
just rust, turns to rust and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to chelate specifically iron or
put it into a more organic form will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it available longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really great point around iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for reminding folks of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just recently did a manganese
sulfate application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mixed it with water and then
applied it over the top of my beds with
[SPEAKER_01]: just a sprinkler can even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hadn't thought about adding a little
bit of molasses or some other carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: source in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might have to experiment with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, moving on then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about
transpiration in plants and what role that
[SPEAKER_01]: plays in sort of... Yeah, fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think about nutrition a lot and I
look at a lot of tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about soil and I really
look at a lot of tissue tests next to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: tests and it's always bothered me a little
bit that they're not perfectly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I spend a lot of time trying to
understand why if you have great
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency and balance in the soil,
it doesn't always translate into the right
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency in plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always known that the biggest
reason is transpiration although there's
[SPEAKER_00]: other factors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've gone into sort of the science
of what causes transpiration and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of misconception in horticulture
around what drives transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, I've always thought like
VPD drives transpiration rate but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really dive into the physics of
plants and energy, energy to the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: drives evaporation from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy and convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air movement, warm air and then
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is ultimately what's gonna drive
the rate of evaporation out of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final thing to note is the
stomata have to be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relative humidity does play a role in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature plays a role in that but
ultimately it's the differential in vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure inside the leaf versus outside
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately you're changing your
evaporation rate based on the total energy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the day when the lights are on or
when the sun is out, the majority of that
[SPEAKER_00]: energy is radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a sense, the VPD doesn't
actually matter nearly as much during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters more at night because
convection is the only source of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: driving transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the day, light intensity and
whether or not the stomata are open are
[SPEAKER_00]: the key variables to the rate of
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm kind of going too far into
the weeds here but if you think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: plants uptake nutrients, sufficiency and
balance in the soil absolutely matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rate of evaporation out of the
leaves is the second thing that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify, we often don't really think
about but is ultimately gonna determine
[SPEAKER_00]: how many nutrients are moving into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, I just see really poor
correlation between calcium and boron
[SPEAKER_00]: immobile nutrients in the plant tissue and
how much is in the soil and that's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: because of transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they move within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as evaporation stops,
you're not getting calcium uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not in indoor environments as much
as definitely in greenhouse environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers don't think about nighttime
evaporation but as soon as there's tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat emission coming off of the plant
leaves and so plant leaves cool down
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when they're exposed to the
open sky at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the leaf temperature can drop,
you're not getting any radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation can essentially stop at night
which is a major problem for creating weak
[SPEAKER_00]: cells at the top of the plant,
increases disease susceptibility but also
[SPEAKER_00]: just stops nutrient transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want nutrient transport happening
24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a number of issues around
evaporation that I think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always thought of it a little bit
differently in the sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: evapotranspiration is being pushed by VPD
as well as airflow across the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: because that higher levels of airflow,
if you have a plant near a fan and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you start to get that leaf tip burn
essentially is a lack of calcium that's
[SPEAKER_01]: developing is because the plant can't
evapotranspirate fast enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: accommodate the amount of nutrients that
are going up through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not pulling up calcium fast
enough to allow for that is how Nadia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Greenhouse explained it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was really interesting
and I do see plants and people could do
[SPEAKER_01]: this experiment, but essentially if you
put a plant near a fan, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically impact the level the water
needs and the amount of evapotranspiration
[SPEAKER_01]: that's occurring in that plant versus a
plant that's further away from a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not getting the same airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so airflow will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's radiation energy and convection
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you increase airflow,
you're increasing the convection energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf, which will increase the
evaporation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with what you're seeing is the
leaf probably can't keep up with the rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it closes its stomata because when it
experiences water stress, it'll close its
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only way for it to maintain
energy balance is to radiate heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaf temperature will go up and you
can start to see burning issues
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the issue there to me with
excessive airflow is the stomata are
[SPEAKER_00]: closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I've always... Oh, I was going
to say, like when I see issues on plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing I look at too is watering
and VPD, which is another way of
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching this transpiration thing that
you're talking about, this idea that is
[SPEAKER_01]: there sufficient water in the media in the
soil for plant roots to take up and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what is the humidity in the room
that allows for these sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: So relative humidity matters a lot in
terms of the opening and the closing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I always thought, and this was a
misconception, that low relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: would increase transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you dry out the air, it'll increase
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if you increase the VPD,
transpiration will go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plant would, like the plant's
trying to compensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it transpires more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is what people say,
if you increase VPD, you increase
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what, I wouldn't see that in the
tissue data with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that this isn't
necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in certain instances,
a high relative humidity creates more
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation because a high relative
humidity can open the stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the plant to actually evaporate
water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humidity matters, but it matters in
part because it's opening and closing the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata, which allows for evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone says VPD, growers usually
think of temperature and relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: on the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily the right metric
to determine stomatal opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, temperature and relative humidity
matter, but the air vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: in itself doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what really matters is leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think a lot of people have heard
that they should use a leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the key to keeping stomata
open and closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who's transitioned from an HPS
to an LED light knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get wildly different results if you
keep the VPD the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because there's a change in leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key here to really understand
evaporation rate and to really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: if the stomata are open and closed is to
understand leaf temperature and to use
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf temperature to do the VPD
calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of been difficult for me to
learn because I'm having to relearn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's these certain
principles that I've always held that as
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken me a long time to try to
understand these new concepts around
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation because it doesn't really work
with my existing sort of my previous
[SPEAKER_00]: learning around how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I'm sort of understanding the
opening and closing of stomata and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation rate, it's helping me
immensely in sort of understanding how
[SPEAKER_00]: these high tech greenhouses are are
managing their environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to have to reach out to
Nadia for more of an explanation or more
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion around this topic, because I
think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to say that I fully
understand everything you're saying here
[SPEAKER_01]: in regards to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still processing it, but I think
that's I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about plants and
agronomy and all of this is I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: never stop learning or being challenged by
by new concepts or new ways of thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: around things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's sort of a whole world of
plants are like these incredibly complex
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and what I think the hardest part
for me in understanding is when you change
[SPEAKER_00]: one variable, you multiple other variables
change simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of what makes it complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the topic of tissue testing,
just to stay on that topic, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: some stuff around sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, tissue testing touch on
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things I just want to
communicate to growers who are already
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue testing or thinking about it,
which is the the need to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things you it's
important to test at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cycle, there's because, as you know,
to add that the plant will translocate
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients late in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually there's, you know, after sort
of the plants stop stretching,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers are stacking the majority of
the assimilates are going toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and there's less leaf growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so certain immobile nutrients are
going to accumulate more and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: in the large fan leaves and other
nutrients that are mobile are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moved out of the fan leaves and moved into
the flowers where they're needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after about week two, a flower and more
so after week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like week two as the target time to
tissue test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after week two, three, four,
the nutrients get really odd on a tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not an easy way to analyze the
results of a tissue test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've received so many tissue tests on
cannabis from like plants at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just I can't even make a
recommendation on it because the calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are sky high and the nitrogen is
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not really a target level that
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really important for
growers to tissue test before week two of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tissue test and veg really any
time before then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, week one, week two, you could go
to week three, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, it's it's really unhelpful
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the size of the leaf
really matters, because, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium will accumulate in the larger
leaves, the older leaves, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking fan leaves three or
four nodes down, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: much different number than if you're
taking the new small leaves at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can think you have low calcium
because the leaves that you're pulling are
[SPEAKER_00]: too small, too young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to stay
consistent and to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that you're pulling are are fully
expanded, large leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a couple nodes down just the first
leaf on a branch that you think is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever you choose, you stay
consistent with that sampling protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the two big mistakes that
people make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always feel bad because,
you know, this is a lot of time and money
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are spending sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week two of flower fully expanded new
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I think those are good points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of tissue testing for the
data that it gives us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's expensive relative to soil
testing for managing fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually used tissue testing a
little differently in the sense that later
[SPEAKER_01]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to use tissue testing as a
as a agronomic tool for this data driven
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions, then I think we two makes a lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where I've used it is I have a plant,
let's say, week five, week six,
[SPEAKER_01]: and something's going on and I can't
figure out what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a tissue test and then that'll
tell me, oh, this reflects what I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a better idea of what a
visual symptom for that nutrient is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I make sure to address it on the
next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I can't I don't feel I can use
that tissue test to make definitive
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions about my fertility applications
the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like a one more piece of
information that supports what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to clarify, are you sat
testing or are you tissue testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue, I haven't gotten into sat testing
for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my concerns around it are the cost,
the fact that the databases are not really
[SPEAKER_01]: publicly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all sort of internal to these
labs, which I struggle with as a wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: more transparency there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, the fact that it's a
number that's going to be changing so
[SPEAKER_01]: much, I would just need to be really I
feel like dialed in with consistency on
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I do think it's really
interesting and I think it has value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I haven't personally gotten to
where that's one of the tools that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like to just say start with
tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forty dollars a test compared to,
you know, seventy five to one hundred for
[SPEAKER_00]: sat testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to get the sample of the lab
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be on ice so that the cost
ends up being more than double when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sat testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, in my experience, doesn't help to
see a single sat test at any random point
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be done like every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you're looking at a much larger
expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see I also totally agree with I
struggle with the lack of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, New Age has has has become my go
to lab, but I've been working with sat
[SPEAKER_00]: testing before they were around and I've
just continued to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're getting recommendations from
the lab and I tend to disagree with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these lab recommendations, especially
around high chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I have a bunch of small issues
with sat testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I just think
the low hanging fruit, if you want to test
[SPEAKER_00]: your tissue, is to get a forty dollar
tissue test.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week to a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start with one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's research established target
levels, multiple different researched
[SPEAKER_00]: levels that are all pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just like an easy
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forty bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it once sat testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use in in large production systems
where let's say a three percent increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in yield makes a huge difference
economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, layering and sat testing on top of
tissue testing makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but honestly, how I've used it is to
do tissue testing, do sat testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is you're just trying to to
validate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to validate the test to
really pinpoint to be extra super
[SPEAKER_00]: confident when you're targeting nutrients,
just because it just gives you more
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence in that that application is
going to be the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, I use it in orchard crops
a lot because we're talking about just
[SPEAKER_00]: huge swaths, huge applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're going to if you apply
let's say you apply potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be, you know, a ten thousand
dollar application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just want to have as much data as
possible to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I would be concerned
about tissue testing that late because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know what the numbers are
supposed to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to see deficient
nitrogen at Wegate, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't I don't use it so much for
nitrogen that late, but but more just to
[SPEAKER_01]: see if there's a trace mineral issue or if
what I'm seeing visually matches with like
[SPEAKER_01]: what deficiency I think it is,
is reflected on that test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's I don't use it very often
as a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more focused on soil testing at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I absolutely understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in things like hydro,
I think it makes a lot a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just say as a shout out to New
Age and Scott, I've met him a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years now at the Soil Summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always enjoy hearing his talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a technology that I've
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I have sent sap samples to
the Netherlands for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent them to New Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I did some split tests last
year for people who do want a sap test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the results in in stone
fruit between New Age and Nova crop
[SPEAKER_00]: control in the Netherlands were very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no need to send them across the ocean
if you're going to sap test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think New Age is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're running out of time,
but I wanted to talk to you just briefly
[SPEAKER_01]: or not so briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it goes about sort of your
new philosophies that you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring around cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for those that aren't familiar here,
you have a course through your soul doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: website that you've had for years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've audited the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful for people who want a deep
dive in soil testing and want the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to really understand those results and
read their own tests and make their own
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best publicly available tool
for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check it out on the soul doctor
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent almost eight months the last eight
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deeply studying greenhouse optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been learning the principles used
in some of the world's largest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most high tech greenhouses, the Dutch
glass houses, where they're just achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable yields and plant health,
like sweet pepper plants that are 10 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, just loaded with peppers and just
really amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with all this, I'm sort of creating
this this program that will teach
[SPEAKER_00]: professional growers principles of what
creates general plant balance in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or indoor grow room and the
techniques and tools to achieve this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of performance, depending on what level of
technology people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this involves the use of various
different technology, as well as sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: and automation to improve facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm developing it for commercial
growers who have some degree of control of
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, outdoor production,
you don't necessarily have much control
[SPEAKER_00]: over the different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm trying to take these principles
that are used in the highest tech
[SPEAKER_00]: autonomous greenhouses and apply them all
the way down to like low tech high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from sort of CEA all the way to low
tunnel or low tech high tunnels and
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the content has traditionally just
been for these really advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't see why some of these
principles can't be applied at every level
[SPEAKER_00]: of grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying to that's kind of my
inspiration behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a Robin Hood scheme to take
this amazing information from these big
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and universities and change it a
bit and apply it to multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: contexts and and present it as succinctly
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been working on doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been taking a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of learning for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also just a lot of content and
research to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of this is content from
Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some professors there that have
really innovated how to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it goes through like a lot of the
scientific balance of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes into sort of the goal of
the grower and different checklists and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to measure things what to measure,
different tools for creating balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a greenhouse, what kind of
materials to be using in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion plastics, high pressure fogging,
AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go through most of the courses
actually going through scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to connect the principles to
a ton of real world grower situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you give me some examples of these
principles that you mentioned that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the course just so we can have a better
idea, can flesh out what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: describing?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the scenarios that I discuss is
around disease and how to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so traditionally, we're thinking a lot
about humidity and airflow and air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really talk a lot in this program about
how to prevent free water on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is often one of the root causes of
disease, either plant cell damage or
[SPEAKER_00]: condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while relative humidity does increase
risk of condensation, condensation can
[SPEAKER_00]: also happen at relatively low humidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final thing that can cause disease
is a weak plant, which is almost always
[SPEAKER_00]: from an assimilant or a photosynthetic
imbalance in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil borne diseases, but also above
ground diseases always happen when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's natural immune system isn't
powerful enough to fight back,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is often due to an assimilant
imbalance or an assimilant deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a steady production and consumption of
assimilants leads to steady root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and steady root exudation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what feeds a healthy microbial
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your microbes lose their primary
food source, they won't be able to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots nearly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of where I'm kind of coming
from, from an assimilant balance
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of different
techniques that you can use to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilant consumption and production in
the plant, production being
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is looking at your average daily
temperature compared to the DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like a really, really powerful
steering technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just it's a really great way to keep
the production and consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilants stable on a 24 hour basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going back to disease,
I talk a lot about how to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the facility,
for example, in greenhouses, I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot of heat emission at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talk about ways to make sure your
plant temperature doesn't reach dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: using climate screens and other means,
increasing air movement, how to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've mentioned this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your convection tubing in the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also doing a lot of experiments with
vertical air fans, so like V-flow fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to create airflow into the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can happen through all kinds of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked a lot about ventilation
optimization and how to sort of manage
[SPEAKER_00]: your vents and how to ventilate your
greenhouse to avoid temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, condensation can happen
at relatively low relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talk about how to determine your
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, growers should be using
absolute humidity, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity to determine
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this really sort of wild example
that always confused me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a, let's say an outdoor
temperature of like 68 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 Celsius, and 85 relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's warmer outside with a lower
relative humidity and you vent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually cool your greenhouse
because the enthalpy or the energy outside
[SPEAKER_00]: is lower than inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these fascinating examples
of where ventilation should be toggled
[SPEAKER_00]: with absolute humidity instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that, just tons of
scenarios on how to manage the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: inside a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were able to, I mean, first of all,
this is fascinating and I know it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a different direction for
you here, but I'm really excited for this
[SPEAKER_01]: and to learn more about this course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know when it's, do you have an
approximate date for release or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: still?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm trying to finish something
this year, but I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still working extensively with growers
on nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, a large farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm managing, especially in the spring,
there's a lot of work and I just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more to dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably won't be done for several
months, but late, late 2025 is my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I still wish you were
able to make it to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and science conference in
Bozeman this year because collective
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation where we're hosting it has all
of these things they have under a happy
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, they have the vertical airflow
fans and all of these different things
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm Adam, the owner is so excited to
have Nadia, Dr. Greenhouse come out and
[SPEAKER_01]: walk as part of the workshop, walk through
the facility and point out everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how they may be doing things
right or wrong or optimized because
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow and humidity and VPD is such a
complicated topic and it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one thing that I, I know it's one
of the things I'm least confident in
[SPEAKER_01]: myself when it comes to cultivation
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I really, I know you're one of
the first people I reached out to and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know you're busy, but I was really hoping
you'd be able to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If things change, it's an open invite,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things change, I'll absolutely let you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see that, that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it fully indoor with
supplemental lighting or are they next-gen
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses in Bozeman with, they do have
light depth capability, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing in what, like negative 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably under exaggerating at
negative 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, in the winter and then
all the way in the summer, when it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it can be the nineties or
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they deal with all types of climates
there and they're able to grow year round,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, and grow healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the largest living soil producer
in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be one of the larger ones,
greenhouse ones that I'm aware of in the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just phenomenally good people
and good growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I am fascinated with these
mixed environments, greenhouses with
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lights, because there's so
much more potential, but also they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're also much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to be good because the,
the, the sun and the variability,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still working with the variability
of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just setting your,
your lights, your like having to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of adjust and move on the fly to
varying radiation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also even cloud coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for example, at night you're
going to lose a lot more heat with an open
[SPEAKER_00]: sky versus cloudy sky and you have to
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very technical and fascinating
form of cultivation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they'd love to have you out,
even if you can't make the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what day is the, is the,
the greenhouse tour?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fifth, September 5th, there's going to
be the tour as well as the workshop
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going concurrently at the same time as a
workshop with Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to be doing a workshop too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe I can try to do some kind of
strike mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the, it'll, I'll be right in the
middle of a massive harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like high intensity and high
consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm not really able to make
it, but I'll, I'll keep it, I'll keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind, Tad, and I appreciate the invite
and we'll see if anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always learn a time when we get to talk
and it's always a lot of fun to have these
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations and people ask actually
quite a bit, like, when am I going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: you back on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate you coming back on
and sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've loved, you know, watching you
