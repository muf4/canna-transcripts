[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is the co-author of Teaming with
Microbes, The Organic Gardener's Guide to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Soul Food Web, published by Timber
Press in August 2006 to great acclaim and
[SPEAKER_00]: revised in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is touted as the most important
gardening book published in the past 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years and won the prestigious Garden
Writers of America Gold Award for
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening Books.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been translated into Korean and
French and soon Slovenian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is also the author of Teaming with
Nutrients, The Organic Gardener's Guide to
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimizing Plant Nutrition, published by
Timber Press in May 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorthand title is How Plants Eat and
What to Feed Them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sure to make you appreciate the
beauty of how plants operate as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: make you a better gardener and steward of
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: His latest book, Teaming with Fungi,
was just released at the end of 2016 and
[SPEAKER_00]: is all about mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is an extremely respected and popular
national garden writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the former president of the Garden
Writers of America, was made a GWA fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1999, and inducted into the GWA Hall of
Fame, the highest honor a garden writer
[SPEAKER_00]: can achieve in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important, Jeff is the founder of a
now national program that started as Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: a Row for Beans, the soup kitchen in
Anchorage, and is now Plant a Row for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hungry The program is active in 48 states
and resulted in over a million pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: produce being donated to feed the hungry
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has been a good friend now for over a
decade and is a wonderful advocate for
[SPEAKER_00]: organic gardening, compost tea,
and the microbes in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk to you more about,
first off, your books in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of success that you've had with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you recommend for users to make
practical applications for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information in teaming with microbes,
teaming with nutrients, and teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think each one has a different
sort of indicator of things that people
[SPEAKER_02]: walk away with.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, teaming with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope people are walking away with the
idea that they need to test their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one ever does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they go buy any fertilizer they think
they need and put it on, or micro food,
[SPEAKER_02]: either way, and they have absolutely no
idea whether or not their soil or their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the important takeaway from
that one, in addition to maybe picking up
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of wonder about what goes on
inside those 30 trillion cells that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: every individual tree that you're looking
at, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teaming with microbes, I think,
is something that the takeaway is that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been doing things wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been feeding the plants instead of
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been concerned about the
fertilizer's impact on the plant instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of thinking about what everything is doing
to the environment that the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in and what is the impact on the
soil and the soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been really just looking at how we
grow things the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can read teaming with
microbes and walk away thinking that that
[SPEAKER_02]: old-fashioned post-World War II throw-on
miracle grow setup makes any sense
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the third book, teaming with fungi,
is really, to me, paving the way to the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no question that when you grow
plants, they need mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're learning about that is
encapsulated in that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just talking before the show about
some of the problems with mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi products, but there's no question as
we move forward, we're going to solve a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of those problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are going to be items that we use
just like the average American uses
[SPEAKER_02]: miracle grow today, as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be applied to every plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: No plants will be sold without them being
added to the soil first.
[SPEAKER_02]: All nurseries will be using them,
etc., etc., etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Monrovia Nursery is one of the
largest wholesale producers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been using it for years now,
isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through mycorrhizal applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more nurseries are, but yeah,
Monrovia has been a real pioneer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single plant they sell has got a
mycorrhizal partner to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it, 96% of all plants have a
mycorrhizal association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's so, then 96% of what
you're growing needs to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal association.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now know that it's not necessarily
there naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years ago, we would have said,
well, these things are ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're cloning a plant,
then there really isn't a chance for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be introduced naturally, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not so much a clone situation,
but even in regular normal soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to think that the spores would
blow all around the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out that the
ectomycorrhizal, which are the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: you might find in a big conifer forest,
yeah, they may blow three or four miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a nursery three or four
miles away, yeah, you don't need to use
[SPEAKER_02]: ectomycorrhizal fungi, but if you're 15
miles away, yeah, maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now know that motor tilling destroys
the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that using fungicides,
certain fungicides, not all of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: creates a situation where you need to add
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that when you're planting seeds,
that it makes sense to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots are infected instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense to put the mycorrhizal
fungi on the seed itself so that you get
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculation immediately rather than have
to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know that if you use too much
phosphorus or too much nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've created a situation where the plant
won't signal for the relationship to
[SPEAKER_02]: begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You begin to get a whole different view
than what we had 15 or 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why I wrote the book,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The progression of knowledge that we've
had with regard to mycorrhizal fungi has
[SPEAKER_02]: been amazing, absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I wrote Peeming with Microbes,
the first edition of Peeming with Microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: had a paragraph on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to revise Peeming with Microbes in
order to add a chapter on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then finally, I think things changed so
much that it just made sense to write the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's an area just like the soil
food web subject matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, even with how plants eat,
we don't learn these things in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learn the names of dinosaurs,
but we don't learn the names of animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a gardener, I believe,
and that's just my opinion, I believe you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to know the science behind what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's back up just a second for people who
may not be as familiar with mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus as you or I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned ectomycorrhizae,
which, as you know, forms a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our gardeners and growers are
going to be wanting endomycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give a quick background on
some of the benefits of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, there are seven or eight
different kinds of mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all defined based upon how they
enter the plant and how they relate inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant root.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, these fungus don't invade the
cells of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are invaginated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little area formed around them,
and then there's a transfer between the
[SPEAKER_02]: two membranes between the fungus and the
plant center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, depending on how they do that,
they get a different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an orchid mycorrhizal fungi,
and then there's the endomycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi, which are invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be stained in order to be
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have relatively large spores,
which can be seen with a magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_02]: quite easily, and you can even sieve them
out of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's the ecto, which have very
small spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all seen those little mushroom spore
prints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ectomycorrhizal fungi are visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see them as they wrap around
roots, and you can generally see their
[SPEAKER_02]: fruiting bodies, which are normally
mushrooms or underground mushroom-like
[SPEAKER_02]: structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the endo, you're right, are generally
for things that we would grow in a garden
row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow crops, cannabis, those would all be
ecto crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecto crops, and there are these two basic
divides, the endo and the ecto.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ecto was the fungus that made plants
able to grow on earth, terrestrial land.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were 400 million years old or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endo are a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about 200 million years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really discovered that even though
there are many, many of them, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: about 350 endomycorrhizal fungi that we're
aware of now, we can only breed about
[SPEAKER_02]: eight to 15 of them in the laboratory
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately for us, the endomycorrhizal
fungi sleep around with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sleep with different plants so that
those same one that will inoculate a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant will also inoculate a
carrot or a potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm right on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should really go look that up before I
say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky that these eight or nine ones
that we're able to produce are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: associate with a bunch of different kinds
of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know the right one to use,
then you're going to be golden.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if we may speak about
cannabis, since it's legal in many states,
[SPEAKER_02]: the endomycorrhizal fungi for cannabis is
readily identifiable and very available.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pick up a package, you can see
whether or not that package contains it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rhizophagus irregularis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the names, unfortunately,
because of the inability to really be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to identify what they are up until the
past year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things have had various different
names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we've been able to do,
because we can now do RNA and DNA testing
[SPEAKER_02]: on them to give them their proper names,
now we know exactly what to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the next five or six years,
people are going to have to change all
[SPEAKER_02]: their labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, if you buy the book,
for example, you'll see certain names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four or five years from now, those names
won't be in use anymore because now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing DNA stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any case, you can look up on the web
and find out what mycorrhizal fungi or
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus your individual plants might need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can see if they have them on the
label and put it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you say put it down,
let's talk about best practice in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd mentioned applying it to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to roll my seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, let's back up a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you read the book, of course,
I'm giving all the great little trade
[SPEAKER_02]: secrets away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the plant that sends the signal out
to make the association.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant won't send that signal out if
it's already getting what the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi will bring back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're giving the plant too much
phosphorus or enough phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to make that signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give the plant too much nitrogen,
it's not going to send out that signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make sure, first of all,
that you're not overdoing the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're already using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you make that determination,
and again, really, you got to test your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, see what's in it, see what kind of
levels you have, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's the take home for the second
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you do that, then there are several
different ways that you can inoculate your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, which is a funny word because
you're really not inoculating your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is calling for the fungus to
come and infect it, but we use the word
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolling the seeds is one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain plants, for example, orchids,
with their particular kind of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi, won't even germinate unless they're
in the presence of that fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so with cannabis and carrots and
tomatoes and that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you roll it on the seeds,
it's right there so that as soon as you
[SPEAKER_02]: get germination, the seed root can send
that signal out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get early, early, early
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you think of this procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I look at mycorrhizal fungus is as
a insurance plan, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my plant isn't getting enough
phosphorus, I'll know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungus is in there as a way to
make sure that that happens and fully
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that mycorrhizal fungus has a lot
more benefit than just phosphorus uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I look at it, it's a one or two
time application when I'm transplanting,
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I roll the roots in them, if I can,
or sprinkle it right on the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we're talking about a high
value crop, like a tomato or a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that this seems like a really great
option and also another reason to use
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little bit less nutrient rich
initial propagation media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we aren't applying too much
phosphorus, potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your attitude is a good attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's your approach to the way you
farm and garden, and that is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: approach, which is, I'm taking care of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a little extra insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people's approach is, I don't really
want to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the plant to do it all itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a slightly different approach,
but I think they both start the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to inoculate the plant,
make sure that it's impacted or infected
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you can do either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge I find is that gardeners and
growers are all alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't leave well enough alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to tinker and they want to feel
like they're in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that whole miracle grow paradigm that
you talk about in your talks and in your
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that just adding it just in
case, and then giving the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, 10 to 14 days for mycorrhizal
colonization before you start doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of phosphorus application is a good
rule or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as long as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it can take up to two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sometimes some of these things
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to do it as early as possible
and you want to wait as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have a tendency to think that
we're in control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of the things that you have
to temper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's one of the reasons why I
wrote the second book, Teaming with
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients, which is a book I wrote for
myself, not necessarily for the general
[SPEAKER_02]: readership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I wrote it is I really
didn't know how plants ate.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they take stuff in?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they use the food that the
mycorrhizal fungi brings back to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens inside those individual
cells?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was dumbfounded by the complexity of
what goes on inside cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dumbfounded by the similarity of
what goes on inside the cell versus what
[SPEAKER_02]: goes on in our universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the old Horton hears a who kind of
thinking pattern is what I come away from
[SPEAKER_02]: after I read that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I'm sort of waxing
about this a little bit is because as you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about your approach to gardening,
as you think about what these mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi are doing and when to put them on
and how you want to use them and what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want them to do, your appreciation for
that can only multiply once you fully
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the internal functionings of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking about botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about learning pistols and
stamens and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about what do they do with the
stuff that you give them?
[SPEAKER_02]: When that mycorrhizal brings that
phosphorus back, what does the plant do
[SPEAKER_02]: with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get that, you get an
appreciation of how the plant operates,
[SPEAKER_02]: then when you decide, gee, I'm going to
give the plant everything it can,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a little bit of insurance or,
gee, I'm going to let the plant just do
[SPEAKER_02]: its own thing, you get a rationale for why
you're doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I find interesting about that is you
and I, when we met decades ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost, on the compost tea side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in fact, I probably changed your
diapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those years ago when we met,
I had no understanding of plant physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: or how a plant uptakes nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so focused on the biological
aspects and nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to hear now that you've
written Team Good Nutrients, it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: you've broadened your approach to
re-encompass some things like soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I both know that you could most
probably get anything to grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you change the biology,
that was our approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbiology was the base, et cetera,
et cetera, and you moved on up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you didn't need to test the soil,
you just needed to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: biology was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do test the soil, you can not
only adjust the biology, you can adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in the soil for the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got on the list were once it was
run by Steve Solomon, who wrote a series
[SPEAKER_02]: of books that basically are Albrecht
oriented, balancing the minerals in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't really read the book and he gave
me a lot of grief because he says,
[SPEAKER_02]: this doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kept beating up on Dr. Elaine
Ingham, who he kept saying he heard on
[SPEAKER_02]: numerous occasions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether she said this or not,
I'm not putting words in her mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying this is what he heard that
you don't need to add any fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grow a plant in any kind of soil
based upon the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I still think it's true,
but I think it's easier if you can also
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust the nutrients in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in other words, I think,
yeah, I don't think you really need to add
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one ever fertilizes the redwoods,
as I always say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, if you get a
redwood and you're growing it and you give
[SPEAKER_02]: it the right biology, but you also give it
a little bit of biology plant food,
[SPEAKER_02]: things do pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've changed my attitude a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's interesting about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a little background,
I actually interviewed Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined his forum a while back after
reading The Intelligent Gardener because I
[SPEAKER_00]: found it fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I too had heard Dr. Ingham's claims
essentially that if you get the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: biology in place, there are sufficient
minerals in all soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you don't necessarily need to be
adding minerals, which was what I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve took a front to, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate that these two camps
take such opposing philosophies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you, in the last year,
I have had Steve using aerated compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas and experimenting with it and
actually really liking the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and he also asked me at one point in
time to come back on the forum because he
[SPEAKER_02]: finally read the book and decided,
see, maybe this isn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, man, maybe you and I just need
to push a little bit more on some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: folks, but there's no reason to be so
dogmatic about these things that you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from the background that we
have, I'm learning more about soil testing
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm definitely a big proponent of it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding that it's very helpful when
we're, especially when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: container soils or reamending potting
soils that don't have everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find in a traditional
garden soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's all manmade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you find that the information is
power?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, if you've got
information, if you don't use it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what's going on in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's power.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, gardeners know that in every
other aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could be a stockbroker and
you're a gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're doing your stock stuff,
you get information when you're doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my mother did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's myth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to study this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you do is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not just buying the bag of tomato
fertilizer because it has a tomato on it
[SPEAKER_00]: or the cannabis bottled nutrient because
it's recommended, but we're actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of research and have a little
more knowledge so that we can make better
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cutting through the marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, I know one of your
practices, same as my practice,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I grow a lot of different kinds of
plants, and again, I'll use cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_02]: example, I don't throw my soil away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't reuse my soil every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't understand why people do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't test and they don't understand
what's going on in their soil for their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why they don't is because
marketing doesn't want them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want you to buy new everything every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, in terms of the
biological aspects of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: since this is an area that you're really
knowledgeable in, can we talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about compost teas and nutrient cycling
while I have you here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, pretty controversial subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooperative Extension Service would say
we're crazy for even talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any number of people would think,
gee, doesn't work, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why do you and I continue to use
compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when we started, it was an aquarium
pump with an air stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everyone did think Dr. Ingham was
crazy and none of this was going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet now there's a ton of companies
selling compost tea brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it at more and more nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no question about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no question that the concept
behind it is catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biological people are coating seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are companies that do nothing
but coat seeds with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I mean, the origins of
that are compost tea, as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compost tea brewers have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to use the ones that used felt
and rung.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've learned an awful lot about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it's because of guys like you
and Tim Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Dr. Elaine continues and,
you know, Carol Ann.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of work continuing in the
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I love compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no question in my mind that it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about some of the
reasonings behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we give people some of the theory
behind why we're making compost tea and
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, well, let's start with
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that compost is a very effective
growing tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either you grow directly in compost or you
amend your soil media with compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know the reasons why.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that compost contains the
fertilizer bags in the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the bacteria and the fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the bottom of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they are eaten by the fertilizer
spreaders, protozoa and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are also plentiful in compost,
the resulting waste products contain
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient nitrogen, in particular,
that feed plants because it's in plant
[SPEAKER_02]: usable form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second part we're beginning to
understand is that when these microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: die, their bodies may, in fact,
and most probably are what create humus,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's one of those things that
people have always been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is humus?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's most probably the dead bodies of
these microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compost tea contains because it's
compost with energy supplied to it that
[SPEAKER_02]: strips out the bacteria and the fungus,
the nematodes and the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some instances, we also feed them at
the same time and multiply them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compost tea contains the fertilizer
spreaders and the fertilizer bags that are
[SPEAKER_02]: in compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about as simple as I can make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're feeding it while we're making
the compost tea, we're getting those to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in numbers and or size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then when we apply the compost tea
to a plant, either as a foliar spray or as
[SPEAKER_02]: a drench, those microbes then have an
opportunity to impact the soil food web
[SPEAKER_02]: that feeds that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That explains it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to clarify one thing that I
think is important for listeners is to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that not all compost is created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that bag of compost at Home Depot
that you may have been sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf for six months is probably not the
same quality as something you may pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your very own worm bin, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a huge difference when
we're making compost tea, because a good
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer can only replicate the beneficial
microorganisms that we put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's probably little question that
what comes out of your worm bin is better
[SPEAKER_02]: than what you buy, you know, at these
other stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll go one step further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us, we like the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not it's not, from my
perspective, something that should be
[SPEAKER_02]: written as a law.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the idea of indigenous microbes
to the extent possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I like to know that the microbes
that are brewing in the tea come from my
[SPEAKER_02]: area because I know that they're going to
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not all of them have to be from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about mycorrhizal fungi,
yeah, we're bringing in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you use Alaska humus, you bring in,
you know, a different set.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by and large, you want to use your own
compost, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I have heard that something like
ninety nine point six percent of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are found pretty much worldwide,
but I assume in different concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things may be more successful in your soil
up in Alaska than my soil here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think even if you're using,
you know, let's say you don't have your
[SPEAKER_00]: own worm castings and you know that you
can source those commercially and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be, you know, microbially active,
there's no reason you couldn't add some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own compost to some of your own soil
into the brew as a way of inoculating your
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I guess what we what
we're saying is if you've got to get
[SPEAKER_02]: compost from the store, you know,
make sure you get the best you possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can make your own boy,
that's the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a good rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that, let's let's let's expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that you have the high quality
compost and you're going to feed that with
[SPEAKER_00]: a food source, whether it be Malawi
glasses, fish, hydrolysate, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever product you add to feed those
microbes that are in the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting it into a brewer as a way to
increase the populations of those microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: and adding oxygen and to strip out these
guys because they stick to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've got to you've got to strip
them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't, you know, what I always
tell people is the stuff that's sticking
[SPEAKER_02]: soil together starts with bacteria,
bacterial slime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same stuff you're brushing off
your teeth in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get up in the morning and just,
you know, whoosh water over your teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get up in the morning and you use
energy to strip that slime away from your
[SPEAKER_02]: teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what those brewers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy to strip that stuff away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to keep the oxygen up.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's here's a question I have for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people see the plant succession
chart in your book and say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I'm growing tomatoes, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want a bacterial dominant
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get focused on making bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your book, you also and when you
talk, you talk about how the plant really
[SPEAKER_00]: controls this process of what it needs
based on the exudates it's putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason not to just make a
balanced tea with good nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: every time and let the plant control that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up for a second, though,
because you picked the wrong example.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out, you know, that you can keep
a tomato growing for years and years and
[SPEAKER_02]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really an annual?
Hmm.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tomatoes are perennials and I
mulch them with brown mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just me.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the plant puts out its own
exudate in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It attracts what it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant has the ability to change its
exudate to attract different things that
[SPEAKER_02]: it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I mean, I love the idea of
first of all, when we talked about reusing
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, a lot of times I'll make my tea out
of a out of a soil that I or compost that
[SPEAKER_02]: I get out of a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grown a plant that I want to use the
tea on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see looking under the microscope at our
different potting soils and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use good compost, your potting soil
can have quite high biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reason you couldn't
increase that in a compost tea brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not only increase it in compost,
but but in theory, again, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell unless you get DNA testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in theory, you're multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you're growing a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use soil from an old tomato plant in
your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory, you've got exudates from the
tomato plant that attracted the microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: that it wanted in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those microbes are in that stuff
you put in the microbe tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in theory, that's what's being
multiplied some of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So giving the plant back again,
the very kinds of microbes that it wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: in the first instance, which makes its job
a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any time you would brew a
fungal dominant tea or a bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I see a lot of these recipes
online on various forums and websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of microscope work to
back a lot of these recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would, you know, if I was trying to
throw something on a tree truck that had
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, a weep on it, you know,
I would try to make it as fungal as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm throwing something on a
tree truck that had a, you know,
a weep on it, you know, I would try to
make it as fungal as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm throwing stuff down around
perennials, I try to make it as fungal as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether I'm achieving the fungalality,
I don't really think I am, but I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least what I think I'm doing is I'm
imparting into the tea the right kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate for fungus to be able to use
once it's down in the soil or on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'm helping it in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always want to try fungal teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get good fungal growth in
teas in general, but overall, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean we're losing any bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to see a tea with good fungus
that didn't also have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively good bacterial levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my thought is the bacterial levels
basically stay the same, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fungus that you increase,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should take that back, but it's sort of
what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, it's a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we put out, you know, a good
diversity and biomass of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, then the plant can really
control what it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to hurt a plant by
putting a fungal tea on an annual crop
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, heck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you say, what's not used will die
and will either turn into humerus or get
[SPEAKER_02]: eaten up by something else in the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of those little microbes,
whether they're used or not by the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least the microbes themselves contain
organic matter, contain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are retained in the soil system right
at the root level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they die, all the goodies that
are in them go to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, it ends up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while we're on the subject of soil
dominance, I want to kind of throw you a
[SPEAKER_00]: curve ball here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just back up one other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think extract is also something people
might want to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, I like compost teas
better, but a lot of people just want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a couple of times a year,
they don't want to make up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to buy a KISS Brewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, so so they take some
cheesecloth and they put compost in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they just need it in water for 15 or 20
minutes and they'll get good microbes in
[SPEAKER_02]: that soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not they won't get the multiple numbers
that you get in a compost tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at least they'll get some of the stuff
out of the compost and they can make sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of an extract that that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they want to just sort of fool
around with a little bit, they can try
[SPEAKER_02]: that instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Wilson on his micro organic site has a
stir method that he lists that he's tested
[SPEAKER_00]: with a microscope that people can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people really need to go to his site.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great site.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, he's he really knows his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on my list for an interview as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about microbial
dominance in soil and we look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant succession chart and I know you're a
big proponent of no till for for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that taking off in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of a lot of cannabis growers are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just recently published a blog post
on the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not completely on board and I'll give
you my reasoning and then you tell me what
[SPEAKER_00]: you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cannabis is an annual
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to prefer a bacterial dominant
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why tilling is effective in a lot
of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunately why they're tilling the
rainforest is to reset that soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy some of that soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the big problem I have with
rototilling is as as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates that compaction zone at the
depth of the tiller and completely
[SPEAKER_00]: destroys, you know, fungal hyphae and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking about indoor
cannabis growers in beds and containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not getting out of rototiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not actually doing we're not
actually tilling the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to dig that soil to allow us to
get more nutrients back into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than just top dressing continually,
I found in side by side tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: we seem to get better results without the
same levels of microbial loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to get your opinion on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, I mean, rototilling,
you're absolutely let's back up for a
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me back for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a bacterially dominated situation
when you're growing cannabis and most of
[SPEAKER_02]: our row crops for that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so what you're saying in theory could
also apply to your carrots and parsley and
[SPEAKER_02]: not parsley because it's a biennial.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I'm saying can apply to
your row crops and things that you're an
[SPEAKER_02]: outside garden as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you're in assess what you're
saying is, gee, is this no till make a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just what it does in terms of
bacterial versus fungal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are other things going on
in the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to balance out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just we're just discussing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying you don't know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, when you when you
rototill, you chop up the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: network and destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has to reestablish itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That impacts the carbon that gets put into
the soil because the endomycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: are coated with globulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where about 30, 35 percent of your
carbon comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from those mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you mess up the system by
rototilling, you know, then you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: then you've got a diminution in in carbon,
for example, when you cut a worm in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I like to say, you don't get two worms,
you know, unless you hit it at the 18th
[SPEAKER_02]: segment, you get two halves of a dead
worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hit it at the 18th segment,
the first half lives, if you believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are other things that you do to
the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're when you're talking about
a a container grown plant or a small bed
[SPEAKER_02]: grown plant, I mean, we're really not
talking about rototilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a shovel and maybe at max
double digging a raised bed is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which is a very different thing than
rototilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're you're not pulverizing the soil,
are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you're doing is you're
opening up the soil and you're adding in
[SPEAKER_02]: some amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, you've got big gigantic
clumps of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it goes under the rule of
the least disturbance possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Least disturbance possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I would I rototill if I was growing
in big beds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But would I would I, you know,
make sure that I had the ability for my
[SPEAKER_02]: roots to be able to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I'd be I'd do a little
bit of disturbance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't disturb the entire bed,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly wouldn't throw the soil
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're both on board for reusing
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I find that it's it's hard to
provide because one of the other issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with indoor cannabis or cannabis grown in
these beds where they're reusing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with no till is that it's very hard to get
in an organic system all the dry nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the rhizosphere with zero
downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reusing that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 24 to 36 hours after you pull a
crop out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the real challenge,
I think, with, you know, strictly not
[SPEAKER_00]: tilling or disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people also don't understand
the full rationale behind the edict of no
[SPEAKER_02]: till.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not necessarily because
you're screwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me correct myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is basically because we're losing our
soil because of rototill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the real reason why the Department
of Agriculture says no till works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why it's so good is because if you
till in the Midwest, that soil ends up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the east, you know, that we have dust bowl
situations and no till is we destroyed our
[SPEAKER_02]: soils by tilling during the during the
dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three, we created the situation which
we lost tremendous amounts of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no till save soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a soil foodware perspective,
no till prevents damage from from
[SPEAKER_02]: happening to the soil food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third thing is there's a general
acknowledgement among organic people who
[SPEAKER_02]: grow things that it is difficult to get
the solid stuff down into the soil food
[SPEAKER_02]: web.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to I like to tell people,
gee, you put the compost on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Elaine says the same thing,
you know, in, you know, 18 months has
[SPEAKER_02]: worked its way down 10, 15 inches because
of the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine if you want to put the stuff
down in the fall and wait till spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're doing, as you say,
a crop every two months, blah,
[SPEAKER_02]: blah, blah, you know, maybe that doesn't
work so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to balance the the concept
of loss of soil, which doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to worry about that from
a rototiller perspective versus that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, balanced off with damage to the
soil food web that you want to maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're doing an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the soil food web that you're
really concerned about is microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biological, you know, and micro arthropod
as opposed to macro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so so again, the concept of
rototilling indoors doesn't quite do the
[SPEAKER_02]: same amount of damage as it would
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not cutting the worm in half,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the the beetles that you want to
make sure that are there making air holes
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know that you don't care about
those on the indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you can disturb the soil,
but I still wouldn't pulverize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's good to get your opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me let me just add one other
thing, and that is when you read teaming
[SPEAKER_02]: with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I hope everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very to me, it's a difficult book to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the the first and the third book,
those are easy books.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but teaming with nutrients required
chemistry and nobody likes chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody nobody likes the idea of chemical
formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you start to get the idea
that not only you're going to have to know
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry, but you're going to have to
know the photosynthetic formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then people back off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to just assure everybody I did
not ever want to write about the Krebs
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle or photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you will not find that in teaming
with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a little bit thicker book to read
than the other two, because it does
[SPEAKER_02]: involve a little bit of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so but I encourage people to read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all three of the books fit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so, you know, hold your nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just take your time and read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget why I was even mentioning that
something important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, in that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I what what I say is that
when you start your systems and if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: planting in the fall and I mean,
you're preparing your soils in the fall
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting ready in the springtime,
you put a band of those nutrients down
[SPEAKER_02]: just below the root system so the roots
can grow into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you anticipate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it down already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then you put the soil on top
and then you don't rototill for four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five years because you've got a nice layer
of good organics and good nutrients down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so there are all sorts of ways to
approach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could you could let's say you're doing
a bit indoors, you could put your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients down at the bottom of the bed
and you're good for three or four grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brought me to another question,
because it got me thinking about teaming
[SPEAKER_00]: with nutrients, because I've read that
book a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest challenge for me is the
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of words that I'm just not
used to hearing or pronouncing or even
[SPEAKER_00]: remembering what goes with what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's and that's you know,
you did what you could with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the words are what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you can change the
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, what a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a shame that we don't know those
words because they're words about what
[SPEAKER_02]: about what happens inside plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not be a vegetarian, you know,
but that cow you're eating is I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's this is what runs our world
from oil, you know, coal, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know the vocabulary because
they didn't teach it to us in school
[SPEAKER_02]: because they didn't think it was
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for our hobby, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's it's it's a challenging book,
like you mentioned, but it's well worth
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, teaming with microbes is sort
of the the the Bible of a lot of gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it only covers one aspect,
like you mentioned, of this whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you've grown and learned and
changed your philosophies even since you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you write that book?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be over 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 2006 is when the first edition came
out and then the revised edition came out
[SPEAKER_02]: 2011, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I what I discovered and I hope
everybody else discovers this as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't want to write any more
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you write a book,
it's like, you know, you go in this little
[SPEAKER_02]: teeny rabbit hole and you're down there
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're down there until you're finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what I got out of it was
enough tools between the three books,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I learned I didn't know any of
this stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got enough tools, I think,
to be able to sit down and be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: piece together things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people ask a question,
for example, and you're the same way now,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see under from a soil food web
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of the answer, you know,
but from a nutrient perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's part of the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's and I've got enough tools
to be able to figure out what I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: what I need to know and where to go when I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, folks, is the best gardening tool
there is, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing for a team of nutrients that
I took away was that there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways that a plant can uptake
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biological aspect is just is just
one of those ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me wondering a little bit more
about humic and fulvic acids, because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of gardeners and growers are using
them and swear by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it, the humic molecule is
a little bit larger in chelates or bonds
[SPEAKER_00]: with these minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fulvic molecule allows to be
taken directly through the cellular wall
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that a little bit better
than I just did?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's well, I think it's broken
down so that it can be taken in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it goes in as fulvic acid
per se, but I could be wrong in that
[SPEAKER_02]: regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first of all, let me let me suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that an awful lot, aren't I?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, let me back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon in your soil is not coming from the
humic acid, the fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 13 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from the globulin that the
mycorrhizal fungi are putting out into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, which is another reason why you
don't necessarily want to disturb the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That globulin is the there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the branches of the fungi die
off, of course, I guess it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: matter that fungi is dead anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so if you wrote a tilling soil that's
already been harvested, it probably
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't make that much difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where your carbon is coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the acids are concerned,
the humic and fulvic acids, they go into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant through the membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess to make it easy, the membrane,
every cell in the plant has a membrane
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the membrane has different little
proteins in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these proteins act like tunnels or
pipes or revolving doors, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of protein they are,
to allow different kinds of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: substances to get into a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each individual protein will only
allow one kind of molecule through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a phosphorus molecule will not be able
to go through the tunnel that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: designed for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so boron, for example, has its own
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of the nutrients has its own
individual way of tunneling into or
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into these individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fulvic acid goes through one of those
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not as fulvic acid,
but probably as broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's constituted as fulvic acid
once it's inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could be wrong in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to look that up or think about
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why before we were talking on
the show, we were talking about the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are 62 different nutrients in
kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your plant takes in 18 different
nutrients into those cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens to the rest of that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the rest of that stuff may be in the
area that is between the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the ability for nutrients to
get into a root, get into the actual cell
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's swimming around in the cytoplasm
in the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can go from one cell in the root
all the way through the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: from cell to cell to cell to cell,
not going through xylem or folam or any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just through the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can go all the way up to the tip of
the plant, through the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's called the symplast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's the apoplast, which is the
system of structure of the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if you got into a cell wall in the
root of the plant, in theory, you could
[SPEAKER_02]: hike from cell wall to cell wall to cell
wall to cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never getting inside the cytoplasm inside
the cell, never going through that
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane and also find yourself all the
way up at the tip of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the things, including folic
acid and other things, may in fact reside
[SPEAKER_02]: in those areas of the plant where they're
useful and helpful for the microbiology
[SPEAKER_02]: that's helping operate the plant and feed
the plant, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trippy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you see a lot of benefits to say
foliar applications using folic acid in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Steve Solomon likes to say,
if you think your plant's deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: boron, then do a foliar application of
boron or copper or manganese or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: particular micronutrient we're discussing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have their purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a big fan of feeding your plants
foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boron, I'm not sure boron even... Some of
the nutrients are mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are not mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all listed in the book,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very complicated... One of the
hardest things I had to do when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: researching the book was which nutrients
are really mobile and which ones aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people think that you can put
any nutrients on the leaves and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: them will travel to where they need to go
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people think none of them travel
foliar other than three or four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: cells away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not a real big proponent of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I got some stuff sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody wants me to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent me a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some kind of foliar nutrient food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why the science would change,
but I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made in Holland, so what the heck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it hurt the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could very well be wrong,
because I usually am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it'll even help the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to discourage people from
trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think people ought to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think testing is important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about that, you mean
setting up an experiment and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: control and making sure that you're
comparing apples to apples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you can, or finding somebody else
who did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can go on Google Scholar and
find...
[SPEAKER_02]: Madness amounts of information and tests
and et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes you can contact
manufacturers and talk to them about how
[SPEAKER_02]: they do their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you find people like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're testing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put your stuff up in blogs and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Wilson, he tests all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people need to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little less of the listserv of people
talking about how big their vegetables are
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little bit more about how they got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that the cannabis industry
has come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, especially because it was
such an underground industry in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really wasn't a lot of research and
testing and just shared knowledge beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on in some of these forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that information was really all
speculation for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to see a lot more
research and testing coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the great things about the
cannabis industry is that it can only go
[SPEAKER_02]: one way and that is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using that, I'll use quotes around that if
you want me to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no state regulator wants their state
cannabis to be full of pesticides and bad
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no grower, I think, wants to be
imbibing their own stuff full of bad
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's wonderful for the soil food
web business, seems to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the more reason why people need to
understand what's going on so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can control, if that's the proper word,
the environment so that they don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to reuse your soil,
it's important that you're not putting a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of mineral salts onto it that would
require a ton of leaching to remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, I don't even think about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've always reused my soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't understand why people would
throw away good organic soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the thought process is the
nutrients have been sucked out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: A, and B, so what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is one of the lessons out
of the second book.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many lessons in that second
book, even though God's not my favorite of
[SPEAKER_02]: the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the normal rule is called the law
of return.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law of return is what operates in
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why nobody feed the redwoods
is because when their needles drop,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go through the soil food web process.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're recycled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nutrients that are in those leaves,
you know, are recycled and go back into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing is lost between the lip and the
cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're growing a crop, you're
breaking the law of return by removing the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that normally would go back into the
soil and put the nutrients back in again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you understand that you're breaking the
law of return, then you put yourself on
[SPEAKER_02]: parole and you put this stuff back in some
form or fashion, either by using a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical fertilizer, if you're a chemical
head, or by putting in a substitute
[SPEAKER_02]: organic material, if you're a soil food
webby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the law of return.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the law of return.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've broken it, you know,
then nothing's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter whether you're a chemical
head or whether you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so your soil, of course, is great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just got that little teeny missing
piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we harvest the plant,
we're pulling out organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pulling out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replace those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage is, if I understand you
correctly, of replacing these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients and reusing the soil is
that we get, we get soil structure in our,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our old reuse soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also get a nutrient cycling and all
these beneficial microbes working together
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess there's two other things I
would add.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can remember the second one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is, of course, is that you've
got the microbes there in that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dormant perhaps, but you've got
the makings of what the plant was using
[SPEAKER_02]: while it was alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're planting the same kind of
plant in that soil again, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't have to try to attract,
you know, the French microbe that it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way from France, because it's
already in the pot or in that soil bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second thing, of course,
is that soil is, if you do it right,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's not only structurally mature,
but it's got a setup designed or a
[SPEAKER_02]: condominium already built for new roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if I was growing a tomato
or cannabis in a pot, when I harvest it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut the plant at the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pull the roots out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the organic matter that's in that root
is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the nutrients and all of that have
flown towards that root system as a result
[SPEAKER_02]: of mass flow, one of the ways that
nutrients get to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the microbes in the rhizosphere are
still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I plant, the roots of the new
plant will follow into the tunnels and
[SPEAKER_02]: byways and pathways of the old plant,
because it's easier for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore it expends less energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a lot, you get a lot of
benefits by reusing that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the least of which is you're saving
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, on top of everything else,
you're being sustainable, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately what we all need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to take up too much more
of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last question would just be what's,
what, what's probably the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: question you ask with, with all the talks
that you're giving around the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the all three books out now,
what, what are growers asking you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get the book on Amazon or do I have
to buy it more expensive from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the question they ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they get, Oh, it's not fair,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course they could buy it from
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And should, what do I, I don't care who,
but where you get it, you should just buy
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the number one question I,
I get from growers, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you, you know, in a way you
sort of alluded to it and that is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: awfully hard to be organic because you're
using, you're using solids versus liquids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that makes any sense,
but the, there is a perception that using
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemicals, cause they're in liquid
form, they go right to the root system
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier and it's quicker and it's less
muss and fuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's better for your plant
cause they get this stuff right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus gee, you know, God, if I'm putting
stuff down in my soil, it takes so long
[SPEAKER_02]: for it to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, unless it's bat guano,
the nitrogen is not going to be available
[SPEAKER_02]: for six months and all that, you know,
I think people are concerned about the
[SPEAKER_02]: timing aspect of organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always tell them, tell them just
calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so there are a lot, a lot of growers
are making various types of nutrient teas
[SPEAKER_00]: now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain things like fish hydrolysate,
like you mentioned bat guanos,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are, there are other organic liquid
nutrients that are, are a little faster
[SPEAKER_00]: acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the big difference for me is
ionic versus non-ionic forms of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you alluded to, is that nutrient
immediately available in organic growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, we may be waiting seven to
14 days for that plant to respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even biologically that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it takes, it takes 10 to 14 days
for those parameciums, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to start eating those bacteria down there
and going crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, it's a, there's no
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a place for tea nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: No question in my mind, but if you,
you know, you should be starting with
[SPEAKER_02]: great composted mixed soil or pure compost
with good drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start with great stuff that's got
great nutrients in it to start with,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause you've tested it, you've fed it,
you've given it what it needs,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, either, either directly or,
or, you know, through the compost system,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you should be good to go as long as
you understand the law of return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other thing where growers
get stuck is they think that they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: with that chemical paradigm of giant plant
in a tiny pot, which just doesn't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to give the plant enough soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow it organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a big challenge,
I think for a lot of growers that try and
[SPEAKER_00]: do a full cycle plant in a one or two
gallon container and want to know why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're used to hydroponics,
you know, where they can, it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: different when you're using soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you have to understand how the
plant operates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't understand how the plant
operates unless you read about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they didn't ever teach us this stuff
in botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the down, that's the downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I never really took formal botany
courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked at botany books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously they just didn't teach us this
stuff, how to think about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more and more people are
growing and coming back to growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about cannabis is it's,
it's, it's the new tomato, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant is becoming, we were having
a little blip now with Jeff sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but as the plant becomes legalized in
all 50 states, which it certainly will,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea growing these plants won't just
be for medicine or for the high,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're interesting plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different colors, different leaf
shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're an ornamental plant and
they're bringing people back to growing
[SPEAKER_02]: things again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't help, but start to grow
some, you know, basil, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you, Hey, what the heck,
you know, and it's a wonderful thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening with this cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the best thing from my perspective is
it's, I think it's altering how people are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to include the roots as Dr. Lane
would like to say, I think it's got to
[SPEAKER_02]: include the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and now that I've written a
trilogy of books and I can call myself
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord of the roots, I so speaketh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, again, I really appreciate your
time today, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just even just catching up with you and
I'm glad we got to talk about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, well, you know, we don't,
we don't get to see each other enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but I got to tell you all my
slides have a little kiss in it here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, I'm always thinking of
you.
