[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Anna Paltseva.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an international urban soil scientist
and assistant professor, Dr. Paltseva's
[SPEAKER_00]: mission is to educate communities about
the critical importance of soil health in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing nutritious food, supporting
healthy ecosystems, and helping to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her expertise is in helping people
identify and remediate soil contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: in urban gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a passion to help others to
understand the impact of heavy metals on
[SPEAKER_00]: the health of soils and the best way to
improve soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to her appointment at the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette,
[SPEAKER_00]: she has taught at New York University,
CUNY Brooklyn College, and the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanical and Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has led to her creating the Delta
Urban Soils Laboratory at ULL that
[SPEAKER_00]: provides soil testing services and
informal education to communities and
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Anna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad to be here and share what I
know about soils and hopefully get people
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to test the soils and learn more
what's in their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found out about you through Bryant
Mason of Soil Doctor Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had mentioned you to me in regards to
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you just give listeners a little
bit of background into who you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am Dr. Anna Paltseva.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also known by Anya, which is a Russian
nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Russia, in the south of
Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my parents' garden, I used to play with
dirt when I was a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this childhood game became my career
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of my parents are agronomists,
and they taught me how to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, our land, and grow our own
vegetables and fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought my family trade to the next
level by conducting research in urban
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, in urban agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got my doctorate degree in earth and
environmental sciences at the City
[SPEAKER_01]: University of New York Graduate Center a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically since then, well,
for the last seven years, since I started
[SPEAKER_01]: my PhD, I focused on urban agriculture,
urban soil contamination, and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, which also led me to open up
recently my very own Delta Urban Soils
[SPEAKER_01]: Laboratory at the University of Louisiana
at Lafayette, where I'm currently an
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant professor in environmental
sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think your area of research is just
really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about urban soils,
trying to grow food in the city is really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big issue is soil contamination
related to things that we're dumping into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils, things that are leaching into
the soils, and these heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about some of the research
that you did around heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the starting, well, yeah, started like
2015 when my PhD advisor offered me to do
[SPEAKER_01]: a test on studying bioaccessibility of
lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then I didn't know what
bioaccessibility was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically now I can easily define it
as a fraction of harmful contaminants or
[SPEAKER_01]: metals like lead that we determine in soil
in order to understand how that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction can affect human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what we find is that not all
metals are harmful, and not all total
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations are harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take lead, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we find with the standard method that
there is like 1,000 parts per million of
[SPEAKER_01]: lead in soil, it's a very high number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it mean that all of this 1,000
parts per million is going to be harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: for humans or plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what form this lead
exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this form will determine the
bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be low or it can be high,
depending on the chemical state of this
[SPEAKER_01]: metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, let's say, lead combined with
organic matter, with phosphates,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bioaccessibility will be low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lead will be present still in the soil,
but it's not going to be harmful or
harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least at much lower level, harmful to
plants or humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it exists in the form of lead
carbonates, it may be more soluble in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, thus more harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my research started with assessing
different methods specifically on
[SPEAKER_01]: bioaccessibility of lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it led me to develop two different
methods in collaboration with Columbia
[SPEAKER_01]: University Research Group and the
University of Wallasee in Italy Research
[SPEAKER_01]: Group on how we use instruments to
determine bioaccessibility of lead in soil
[SPEAKER_01]: using X-ray fluorescence analyzer machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one was visible near-infrared
spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These methods allow us to quicker assess
the harmful fractions of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just total concentrations,
and be able to test more soil samples at a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're saying is it's really
important to look at bioaccessibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: that how easily can the plant uptake that
particular heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the factors that you mentioned
is the form that that heavy metal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual chemical form of that heavy
metal in terms of what it's bonded to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the other factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just off the top of my head here,
I'm thinking that plant selection would
[SPEAKER_00]: play a big role, pH, the hydrology or the
amount of moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do all of these come together in terms
of determining if you can grow a safe crop
[SPEAKER_00]: in a given soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those factors indeed have a
huge role in the availability of metals in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that plant type is actually
more important than the amendment type
[SPEAKER_01]: that we tried to use to remediate soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants would react differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants would take up more lead and
arsenic that we studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them would not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it would be more susceptible to get
contaminants on the leaf surfaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, like leafy greens,
spinach or lettuce from splashes from
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding areas or dusty positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really plant selection plays a huge
role, which also means that we can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some vegetables in moderately contaminated
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those, like we grow tomatoes or
eggplants or squash, sometimes it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing further from the surface of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants have physiological barriers
inside of them, like food vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they grow further from the soil,
then it will not have splashes from
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then leafy greens and then root
vegetables will be, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible to this level of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another factor like pH that you mentioned,
which is really huge, is that most of
[SPEAKER_01]: metals will be least available at pH close
to neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like slightly acidic to neutral pH,
metals will be least available while
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients will be mostly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nature is smart, as I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes nutrients available and metals
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it drops, pH drops to very acidic
levels, it can make lead and arsenic,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, more available for plant
uptake or human impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to keep pH close
to neutral as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic metal is another one that's really
important to mention because it binds lead
[SPEAKER_01]: or some other metals and forms
organo-mineral complexes, which are more
[SPEAKER_01]: or less stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will take time for organic metal to
degrade to release those metals again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found it to be an effective way to
remediate soils by adding compost to
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, it also has a dilution
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we add the extra volume of compost or
any other organic amendments to the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it dilutes the overall concentration of
metal in that soil, plus vegetables that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in that soil will typically have a
high yield and will be larger in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also creates a second dilution
effect in, let's say, tomato, fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: or an eggplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compost is a really great way to
remediate contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another factor is also you mentioned
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, it's good to have moisture in
soil, especially if it's summer and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very windy or it's an area that's
susceptible to erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moisture helps to reduce dust and
redistribute contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really good to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another factor is soil composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sand or clay soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clay soils may hold more contaminants as
much as they hold nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: While sand soil is more permeable and that
consists of pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pores doesn't really hold down much of
nutrients or contaminants on their
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be more leaching happening
in sandy soils compared to clay soils that
[SPEAKER_01]: will act like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're referencing the CEC or cation
exchange capacity of a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher the CEC, the higher the
ability to retain heavy metals in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the cations, the positive metals.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what about the anions though?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a higher CEC soil, would you still see
more anion retention?
[SPEAKER_01]: The possibilities will be leached out
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like arsenic is more leachable,
for example, than lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lead will stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very mobile, but arsenic is
typically in a negative form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arsenate or arsenide will be
susceptible to leaching and moving down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think of compost as a source of
soil contamination in terms of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals as well, depending on where that
compost is sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, frankly, locally,
a lot of the municipal composts aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing good testing and they're
composting some, I think, somewhat mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: material where people are throwing stuff
into their yardways that they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does one evaluate compost to know
if what they're adding is actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be decreasing their heavy metal load or
potentially increasing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also found that some compost that
we were buying for our research contain
[SPEAKER_01]: elevated concentrations of metals that
shouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we didn't use them for our
research, but it was a really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer your question, basically testing
is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should periodically test samples or
bags of compost or any other amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: that you buy in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really good investment if you
want to make sure you're not adding
[SPEAKER_01]: additional heavy metal concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will still get some of the metals
because metals, you know, they present in
[SPEAKER_01]: plain tissues, but they should be at a low
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless those composts are made from
contaminated manure or from trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves from the trees that grow next to
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other type of compost, if it's like you
make your homemade compost, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have very minimal metal concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing is really important to
understand what levels you add into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil so you don't create accumulation of
these metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either make your compost yourself and
you know what you put in the compost or
[SPEAKER_01]: you test what you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so for one of the things I
want to talk about with you is the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that I agree testing is so important,
but it's been it's been not a affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been way too cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I first got my soil mix
tested, a potting soil to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were meeting the requirements of a
fertilizer because of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients we're putting on, it's a much
higher requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were just going to sell potting
soil, I wouldn't have to test it for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what ninety nine point nine
percent of the industry does right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't really know what heavy
metals are in our potting soils because no
[SPEAKER_00]: one's testing them and no one's testing
the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you register as a fertilizer,
it's a higher requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, long story short, the cost to do
that was a few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get a guaranteed analysis and
then I can put this gets publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a homeowner, I also wanted to test
my soil in my backyard because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being that it was a suburban area,
you know, I didn't know what construction
[SPEAKER_00]: had been done on the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I before I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I didn't know if things had
been dumped here by a previous homeowner
[SPEAKER_00]: or things had leached.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to me about this, this lab testing
that you're doing and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pricing and just how amazing this is
now as a way for people to test their
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you brought up really great points.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to know land use history,
land management history of your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's possible to find those
documents or maybe look up on some EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: websites, they always have really great
tactic maps or information on the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get an idea what potentially
could be in your soil and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: proximity to highways or form industrial
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least get an idea what could be found
in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of testing in the labs,
of course, commercial laboratories they
[SPEAKER_01]: would charge certain amounts of dollars
for their testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically university labs are much more
affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my experiences working at New York
and Brooklyn College and here at
[SPEAKER_01]: Lafayette, we are not doing it for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for private organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really we use this lab expenses or costs
to cover the benefits of materials we use
[SPEAKER_01]: to test the soil and really support
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the method we're using, for example,
to test heavy metals is an express
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually called portable x-ray
fluorescent analyzer instrument that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use a lot in New York and we have here in
Lafayette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reduces the cost because the
machine itself is much less expensive than
[SPEAKER_01]: mass spectrometers that commercial labs
typically use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those mass spectrometers, of course,
provide high accuracy and precision,
[SPEAKER_01]: but modern XRF machines, they have
actually good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very reliable if samples are
properly prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we achieve this relative
accuracy is by, let's say you send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil sample, we'll analyze it by first
drying in the oven, reducing the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: condition, get rid of the moisture,
then sieve it to two millimeter size to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the homogeneity of the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then measure this soil in a special
cup with a special film that does not have
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this XRF machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a result that give us close,
you know, proximities to the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this reduces the cost because the
instrument is much less expensive than
[SPEAKER_01]: mass spectrometers and it requires less
time to prepare and analyze soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you do a mass spectrometer
analysis, it takes a few days and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to prepare the sample, like dry it,
sieve it through, then you have to weigh
[SPEAKER_01]: it in very small numbers, like 0.2 or 0.3
grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to add different assets
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to put it in a microwave or in
a hot plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to run it on mass
spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will take several hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to process the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this will require more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it becomes more expensive
when you have to pay for the time of the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of technician, assets for machine,
SPMS maintenance is quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have been using here is this
XRF portable machine that allows much
[SPEAKER_01]: faster results and less time to process
the soil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be also fertilizers, it can be
different amendments, compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of solids that we can analyze in
those XRF cups that they call the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic cups that we use for the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need typically at least like one
centimeter depth of the material to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I understand you correctly,
you're saying that the methodology that
[SPEAKER_00]: you use is maybe not quite as accurate as
a mass spectrometer, but it correlates
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll give you within a fairly good
standard deviation of what you would get
[SPEAKER_00]: from a mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the method itself is dramatically less
expensive and much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a huge savings in both time
and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been using your labs now for a
few months, testing formulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as our potting soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tested any actual soils with you
yet, but that's something I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to in the future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have the ability to test all of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the good point to notice that
this procedure is like having it slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: less precise and accurate than mass
spectrometers, but you can test more
[SPEAKER_01]: samples with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the same amount of money, you could
test more samples and it will resemble
[SPEAKER_01]: variability of your soil or potting mix or
whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because soil typically or soil mix is very
heterogeneous and soil in general is super
[SPEAKER_01]: heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: At your property, your soil on the lawn
versus soil next to foundation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house or under a tree or in your vegetable
garden may be very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to test more samples as a
slightly lower accuracy, but get a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: number of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the better understanding of
what's actually happening in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you're doing analytical
chemistry, it doesn't matter if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, if you've got like 25 parts
per million of lead versus 20 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million of lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to detect the
hotspots of contaminants and compare them
[SPEAKER_01]: to guidelines to see if they're higher or
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for an average gardener,
that's more important to test more samples
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand what's happening in the
entire property than just test one
[SPEAKER_01]: representative sample on a expensive
machine versus have multiple samples
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a statistical perspective,
by increasing your end value, the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of samples that you're taking,
I could probably take eight or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: samples for the price of what it would
have cost me to go with the mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can graph those and plot them and then
come up with a more consistent value
[SPEAKER_00]: across all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably be as accurate or even
more accurate of what's actually going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in my soil or in my fertilizer than one
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good point you brought
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this is something that the labs,
university labs, I have noticed reading
[SPEAKER_01]: research, not just in the United States,
but in some other countries as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: start using more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an XRF method.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are EPA or USDA methods,
how to use, I think it's EPA protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it developed to just follow the
procedure, how to prepare a sample and
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze it, which also, this machine also
allows to test soil in a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, like outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the result may be less accurate
because it's moist or it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: heterogeneous, but still if you go around
the city or even a garden, we can detect
[SPEAKER_01]: the hotspots of high levels of metals and
collect those specific samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really good to understand the
variability in the garden or in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is what I'm aiming to do in my
research is to analyze soil in Lafayette
[SPEAKER_01]: and see how metals are distributed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this instrument allows us to do it in
a real time setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we go around, we analyze it,
we get the data within 90 seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can collect samples from
highly contaminated areas and bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: to the lab for further more accurate
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in your research, how are you finding
soil depth or compaction influences heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are the heavy metals more at the
surface of the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you're talking about dust
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you finding them further down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, could I grow a crop that's a deep
rooting crop as a way of potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: helping remediate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I less likely to have contamination
growing something like a lettuce that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very low rooting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's typically closer to topsoil
or on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't add compost to your soil,
just say it's normal soil, you will see
[SPEAKER_01]: it's closer to the surface or really like
topsoil that's mostly contaminated from
[SPEAKER_01]: all these deposits over the last,
I don't know, let's say 100 years that
[SPEAKER_01]: lead has been used or other metals been
used and deposited from industrial sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: from highways, from lead paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add something like your compost
over and over every year, then of course
[SPEAKER_01]: you're burying your contaminants under,
which is another remediation technique by
[SPEAKER_01]: the way, with burying contamination on the
compost layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, topsoil is most likely going to be
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you don't plan on growing
vegetables, if you live in an urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, this would be a very simple
way to just make sure that your yard is
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your kids to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's even more important than for
vegetables because vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I said, like they pick it, they can,
some of them can grow well and safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them like carrots should not be
grown in contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for children, it's imperative to test
soil, the backyard to make sure the kids
[SPEAKER_01]: are not exposed because the primary
pathway of heavy metal exposure for people
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually ingestion and house dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So children who are playing in the
backyard on the bare soil, they would
[SPEAKER_01]: touch fingers and then lick their fingers,
ingesting potentially contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this should be avoided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, first test the soil,
see what the levels you're getting and
[SPEAKER_01]: then plant some lawn on top or put some,
some sort of fabric, some protection
[SPEAKER_01]: layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So children are not exposed to bare soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely parents who have small
children should test their soil just to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent potential exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as a new parent to a two year old,
I am always thinking about this as someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who thinks about soil a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're living with my in-laws
and they live on a golf course and I watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical applications that are
happening onto the grass on the golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want my daughter to play
anywhere near that grass for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think as parents,
that's something we definitely want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I've seen research that shows
that children uptake these chemicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming these heavy metals quite
readily, even sometimes more so than
[SPEAKER_00]: adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a wonderful point for
people that live in cities or in areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of Oklahoma just because I do
a lot of work in Oklahoma and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of contamination sites
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, parents, please do consider
getting your soil tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll list all the ways to,
or the method to go about getting a hold
[SPEAKER_00]: of Anna and submitting samples to her lab
on, on the podcast page so people can get
[SPEAKER_00]: that information and absolutely get a hold
of you for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I send in my sample to you
and whether I'm growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, I just want to protect my
child and know the ground safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back with high levels of arsenic
or high levels of lead or cadmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will depend on how high those levels
are, but and where the, how big the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the whole garden or just a vegetable
plot?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the basic techniques to
remediation is adding compost or some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of organic metal like mulch or something
else that will help to dilute the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: bind metals with this organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another option is to put lawn on top of
some sort of grasses to cover bare soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no erosion happening, reducing the
potential runoff of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, so planting vegetation,
adding compost or some sorts of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try and change chemistry of this
metals by adding your phosphate amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: or phosphate fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we found it would be tricky for
an average person to figure out how much
[SPEAKER_01]: to add and how long it will take to break
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some studies that did successful
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the change in your chemistry of lead
and converting it to paramorphic with the
[SPEAKER_01]: stable lead phosphate mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for an average person, it can be
tricky to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some, sometimes if it's possible,
you can bring a new soil, a new clean
[SPEAKER_01]: sediment from if it's some organic matter
in it, of course, for nutrient content
[SPEAKER_01]: from another area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people take it from maybe like a
farmland and they know it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in New York, for example, there's a
program that's called the Clean Soil Bank
[SPEAKER_01]: when actually distribute the glacier
sediment to community organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly sand, but it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pristine because it was collected
from deep layers when the foundation of a
[SPEAKER_01]: new building is being constructed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that glacier sediment in the community
garden, let's say, can be mixed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost to provide nutrition value and
successful plants can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's much safer for
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is a way to bring a new soil,
it's a possibility using raised bed soil
[SPEAKER_01]: or build a raised bed on top of
contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't worry about children,
if you don't have children, you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: small kids and you only want to grow
vegetables and you don't want to do any
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments or any compost additions,
then grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found to be grown well in the
moderately contaminated soils because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have physiological barriers inside of them
that prevent metals to be uptaken to food
[SPEAKER_01]: and further from the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tall plants and they don't really
have plashes from surrounding areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will be very simple techniques,
probably least expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can excavate it and bring
absolutely new soil, but it will be more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking about soil as the
primary source of contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can we talk a little bit about where
this is all coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that soil started out
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this contamination coming from
and how do we limit that in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just our gardens, but also our homes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing to know that the metals
naturally occur in soil from parent
[SPEAKER_01]: material such as rocks and minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those levels are typically very low
and they're not harmful to people because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're natural sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, we do have anthropogenic sources of
metals, which in most cases is industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's roads, cars, vehicles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaded paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it has been banned since 1978,
but lead paint is still on some old
[SPEAKER_01]: houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important for people to know what
kind of paint they have on houses if they
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in them and they know they're
before 1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they most likely will have some lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to know that part
and then do testing of surrounding areas
[SPEAKER_01]: if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even test paint chips these days
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to reduce the house
dust, especially if there are children in
[SPEAKER_01]: the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: By doing a cleaning just like,
you know, with some wet napkin or
[SPEAKER_01]: something to bring down the dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust is one of the main sources inside of
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dust can come from, you know,
from windows, from open doors,
[SPEAKER_01]: from shoes that people work outside or
walk outside and bring this dust and dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: into the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to avoid this, leave shoes outside or
change shoes when you walk inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring dirty instruments from the
garden into the house and do wet cleaning,
[SPEAKER_01]: like wash floors and wash window ceilings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, those are basic recommendations
to reduce contamination inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot change land use history of
locations where we live because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they had some industrial sites
in the past, but we can control our
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of our homes by just doing good
cleaning periodically and testing what's
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding our houses and knowing the
history of the house or at least when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing people I want people
to consider when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: edible crops and food crops is everything
that those roots or that soil is coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to build a garden,
think about the material that you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: to build with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with fabric pots, I've saw some
research, some pots coming out of China
[SPEAKER_00]: that showed high levels of lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when those roots hit that edge of
fabric, that fabric pot, they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to that lead and they can
potentially be taking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really think like a scientist
or like a detective when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read labels, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of change directions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about heavy metals
related to gardening and urban soils since
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a cannabis cultivation podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know your experience is not with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk a little bit about heavy
metals, though, you know, some of how that
[SPEAKER_00]: might relate to cannabis and get your
thoughts on some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things is in certain states
now they're testing the flower for
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic, cadmium and lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at fairly aggressive thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis appears to be a fairly good
at uptaking not just nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing some failures in certain
states based on the methodology that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already talked about ways to sort
of reduce heavy metal exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not testing vegetables
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that down the road policies
might change in terms of how how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, like maybe cannabis might be sort
of an example for how we may eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: test vegetables?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the answer here would be
to understand that cannabis is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hyper accumulated plant and that
plant basically is capable of uptaking
[SPEAKER_01]: metals from soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is why policy is really
forcing on measuring cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all vegetables are taking up metals at
the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each vegetable, fruit or berry or tree
versus grass, they have their own
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities, how much they can or willing
even to uptake metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did some of them can be tolerated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some can be more susceptible than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants may be affected by even low
toxicity levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others can be much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them may prevent contaminants
going into their tissues like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no need as much as cannabis to
test tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to understand
what type of plant that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to hyper accumulated
plants or plants that we know can take
[SPEAKER_01]: more metals than the average plant,
then it needs to be more vigorously
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a policy person, but from a
science point of view, that's how I see
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go to the grocery store
and eventually have there be
[SPEAKER_00]: conventionally grown, organically grown,
heavy metal free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some of these new labels that would
allow me to make choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would pay a little bit more to
know that what I'm buying is free of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain contaminants beyond just the
organic certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to the question,
but I think it's definitely more
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting and it comes back to testing
and pricing for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have to test everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then every batch, it will be lots of data,
lots of processing, lots of labs and lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of delays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think having more vigorous food
testing is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know FAO recently was bringing it up
that they were collecting data from
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists around the world on I think it
was mercury and fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to see more data on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it is moving towards food
safety testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And metals and perhaps other contaminants
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes some time to be able to test
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I share with you some of what I've
found in cannabis related to heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And please just correct me if anything I
find seems odd or wrong or inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we've been diving more and more
into this heavy metal thing, because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had a few growers fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who manufactures soil in
addition to this podcast and the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do organic soil and organic amendments,
there is always going to be some heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal load in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're always looking at how to
reduce this because we use things like
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust, which as you know, contains
levels of heavy metals and soft rock
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any mined product or in my experience
contains some level of heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about heavy metal management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't reduce it to zero, but we want to
make sure that we're not overloading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beyond that, keeping our pH a
little more alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to run my pH higher than
traditional agronomic recommendations,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably closer six, eight to seven range
rather than, you know, six, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, five, like I see like I see in a lot
of places is sort of the sweet spot for me
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of in terms of reducing heavy
metal risk, but still allowing for good
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient availability in terms of
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I just want to throw out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's failed just using our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always found other sources of
contamination that were more significant
[SPEAKER_00]: and really contributing to a fail rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these were water sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought they had clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were from a well and they
actually were bringing up ground water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another one in a facility that was
an old building in Oklahoma City and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing a lot of construction and they
were kicking up dust and that dust was
[SPEAKER_00]: falling onto the leaves and causing
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a little bit of a tricky one
to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even things like sump pumps or metals that
are in contact with water for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in a reservoir or through an
irrigation system we found can increase a
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metal load too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's it's a challenge and you're
always trying to figure out what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess one thing you brought up
was phosphates, which I thought was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and how they might bind up
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that we find
with I've been trying to find a good
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus source that was vegan or not
animal based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ones I find are also bringing in
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent one sample to you of a soft rock
phosphate and it came back with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lead levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how one do you know of any great
phosphate sources that are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lower in heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can you talk a little bit more
about this phosphate binding Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's a good question on sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that came to my mind is the fish
bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not I mean, you said you want it
to be vegan or like not animal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, yeah, it's appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a traditional rock mining,
you know, mineral, which is running out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need looking for other phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, fish bones would be non vegan
source, which might not have as much heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals as anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to think about this one and get
back to you if I find the resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, fungi would help to release
phosphorus that's in the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: making it more accessible for plant
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there will be some mixes with
fungi that could be developed more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Allison Justice actually sent me a
paper a couple of years ago out of Italy
[SPEAKER_00]: that showed with hemp increased heavy
metal uptake into the hemp biomass with
[SPEAKER_00]: the addition of mycorrhizal fungus,
which makes sense to me because
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungus increases the nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most notably phosphorus, but other
nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they saw higher levels of arsenic
with uptake with it, which I just thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was interesting research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess maybe my question arsenic
becomes more arsenic becomes more
[SPEAKER_01]: available with phosphorus addition,
while lead becomes less available with
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a paradox when both lead and
arsenic are present in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus may not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus may not be the best solution
if soil is contaminated with both lead and
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did the tests for heavy metals in
our research in New Jersey, we tested the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that was contaminated with lead and
arsenic, and we added different phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and we added different
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw that arsenic was more
available, was not fixed by phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously because they start competing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arsenic becomes more mobilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But compost was a better result for us and
showed the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was more successful as a
remediation technique compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing you mentioned was that
arsenic is more leachable than lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: How realistic is it for someone to flush
their soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or their media as a way of reducing
arsenic levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to make a significant
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting question that I'm
not capable to answer fully because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: there is such thing as an industrial
washing when they do it on a large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can wash soil with water or maybe
some other solvents that help to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if it's efficient for a
person to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not something I've seen in
literature because I've never was curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about it until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think it's not very super
leachable just because we still see it in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that have fairly significant
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was a precipitation in nature,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they maybe needed some technologies to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to make it more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was like nitrates, for example,
then we would we would know pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disappear into our water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's a microbe down the
road that someone will discover that will
[SPEAKER_00]: allow us to tie up these heavy metals more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a really cool invention or
discovery, I guess we would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there are research studies
related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was promising to find some microbe
that are converting metals into less
[SPEAKER_01]: available forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also fungi help to convert lead to
paramorphous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you asked me earlier about this
conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what basically happens is when lead is
exposed to available phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: it combines into paramorphous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would need lots of phosphorus in
the environment to combine with lead
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will take some time, sometimes
maybe a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the climate and the zone
where the site is located.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea here is that just lead
becomes lead phosphate mineral and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very stable and it's not or not
bioaccessible or has very low
[SPEAKER_01]: bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really harmful to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets to human body, like,
let's say a child consumes it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will just go through the system and,
you know, just the child poops it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: not being dissolved in a bloodstream
compared to other source or other forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So paramorphous is really good mineral to
have, but it takes time, naturally,
[SPEAKER_01]: to form it or artificially to form it if
you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just play around in your garden
and try to make this conversion yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get a lab test back,
that's not going to tell us the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: form of the arsenic or the lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't know how available this is to
our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just know that it's present in some
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different methods how it's
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metals can be measured in total
concentrations and phytoavailable
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations for plants and in
bioaccessible concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total concentrations is just gives us
total numbers of how much in total lead or
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic or cadmium in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytoavailable, those methods are using
extractions to see how much potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: can be uptaken by plants or how much it's
available at least for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be lower than total
concentration, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of it is going to be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be found in labs, a lot of labs
testing for phytoavailable nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another question is
bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen only few labs around the country
who test for that for public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more effort to do that method and
do sample preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the method is still, there are
different methods how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an EPA method, there's a European
method, different authors came up with
[SPEAKER_01]: different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to say which one is the best
and it's still tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some ways to assess the
bioaccessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we do the extractions,
we try to mimic gastric solution in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really difficult to predict what
the human gastric system is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our chemistry of gastric solution
changes if before we eat, after we eat,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will respond differently potentially on
the metals we would consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult to mimic this in
the lab conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's so methods that exist
out there and the labs don't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: not many labs offer those tests to public.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the chance to find the lab that
test for bioaccessibility, you should do
[SPEAKER_01]: at least several samples for you to get an
idea what numbers you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's not very cost effective
necessarily or realistic for the average
[SPEAKER_00]: person or grower to find that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know the prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know what are the prices for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not as publicly available
test as I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not every laboratory offers that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you were talking about that,
it got me thinking about one other
[SPEAKER_00]: variable that I meant to mention that
we've kind of touched on is not just crop
[SPEAKER_00]: selection in terms of variety or species,
but also cultivar selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of genetic diversity we see
in cannabis is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much larger than any other ornament
or vegetable crop that anyone would grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that certain genetics will
uptake heavy metals much more efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because one genetic failure
doesn't mean that other ones will fail in
[SPEAKER_00]: that same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one other factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many variables here
when it comes to heavy metal uptake that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've touched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complicated talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's more to learn in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything else that you would
like to share before we sign off in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to your research or upcoming
research that you're really excited about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, currently I am working on soil
survey for heavy metals in Louisiana,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I always welcome samples from around
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to see what people
are getting in their soils or amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: or fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lab is open to other people from across
the country to send the samples to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue studying heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a different form and shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my current research also involves
using magnetism, so magnetism to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how that may correlate with
heavy metals and also find a way to make
[SPEAKER_01]: methods even less time consuming,
even more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still working on developing the
best methodology possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully in the future we'll be able
to offer the bioaccessibility test with
[SPEAKER_01]: XRF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are still working on that to make it
through portable technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, basically if people want to send
their soils to the lab, feel free to send
[SPEAKER_01]: them to our website or just Google Delta
Urban Soils Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will find information on how to
collect the samples and where to mail them
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to look at my research,
I also have my website, it's AnnaPelceva
[SPEAKER_01]: .com and my Instagram,
SoilUnderschoolExpert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love chatting with different people and
I'm always responding to my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be pleased to hear what
people experiences in their gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: homes around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought those up because I
was going to list all of those things and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have them in the introduction as well
and on the podcast page because it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little tricky to spell your last name
for people unfamiliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I highly suggest people do check out
your social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're quite active on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just recently posted, I saw a
story where you were showing exactly how
[SPEAKER_00]: you do the testing on the heavy metal
analysis, which I thought was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to actually see what's
happening in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're a very interesting mix of
fashion and soil science, which you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: typically put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a lot of fun and people
should definitely check you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that you reached out to me
and invited to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to collaborate more on
different projects, test more of your
[SPEAKER_01]: samples and being engaged with the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely will be sending you a
lot more samples as we try to discover not
[SPEAKER_00]: just we're testing, we're in the process
of testing all of our soil amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers right now to make sure that we
know the heavy metal levels and know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we're working on formulating all
the time, trying to come up with new
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations that are going to lower heavy
metal risk for growers on the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're doing is a huge resource
and we're very grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Dr. Anna Paltseva and you are
listening to the Cannabis Cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post pertinent links on the podcast
page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the learn tab and then
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
I'll see you next time.
