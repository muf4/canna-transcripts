[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this episode is a bit different than
previous ones for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate to be able to attend a
conference focused on the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements in photobiology and equipment
for commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about some of the largest
commercial cultivators of cannabis in all
[SPEAKER_00]: of North America, as well as some of the
big ornamental and vegetable producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be there, made some great
contacts, and learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even met a few people who were familiar
with the podcast, which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya Palmer was also able to attend,
and in this episode, we discussed some of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we learned as well as how these
topics relate to the future of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listened to the most recent
podcast, then you're already familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a biological horticulture consultant
with a long history in both cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable production and a proponent of
regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a good friend and colleague.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following is just our unedited
conversation discussing our notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways from what we learned this past
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get caught in a rabbit hole
here in Washington State and on our farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not able to stay up to date with
all the exciting new advancements and
[SPEAKER_00]: products and changes in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great chance to get perspective
on where the industry appears to be headed
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that will affect growers in the
coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about this
conference we attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any initial thoughts before we dive into
some of the speakers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was just great to be in a room full
of people who are all leading the field in
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had university professors, financiers,
master growers, some equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers from HVAC, and lighting,
and high-density storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much all the people you'd need to
design a cutting-edge facility were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me some ideas on where I think the
future of cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: production is now that I've got a little
more insight as to what some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale commercial facilities and
large-scale horticultural facilities are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into those thoughts,
I wanted to talk a little bit about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the specific speakers that we got to
hear from, one of them being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic impact of light intensity on
yield and secondary metabolites,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was Allison Justice with Outco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison is someone that I've talked about
in my talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you had sent me an article on her
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a PhD in horticulture,
I believe, and she came in and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: using Heavy 16 at this facility in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was able to formulate over the next
seven or eight months her own mineral salt
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen that dropped their cost 27 times
by what they were spending before on
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe there was a single
cannabis facility in the room that was
[SPEAKER_00]: using bottled nutrients because it just
didn't make practical sense at the scale
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking about huge,
huge facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit about Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the actual study that she was doing
was looking on how much light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cannabis is a high-light
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a pretty high level of
intensity, but we didn't know the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of that in terms of its impact on
plant physiology and yield and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at my notes here,
and it looks like they took 90 cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa variety was hazy OG, an average
temperature of 23.7 degrees Celsius with a
[SPEAKER_00]: variance of 1.7 degrees Celsius,
an average relative humidity of 52.5%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and CO2 around 1,500 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ran fluent LEDs at 400 PPFD,
600 PPFD, double ended HPS at 700 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then more fluent LEDs at 800 and 1,200
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed a daily light integral,
which is the amount of light that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: gets over the course of the day,
ranging from 7.3 micromoles up to 51.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like going back and looking at
the data, they collected fresh weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight, and trim weight, and they saw
a 26% increase in shoot fresh weight from
[SPEAKER_00]: going from 400 to 600 as the average PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there on up, you get a
slight increase, like from 800 to 1,200
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD, you only saw an increase of about 5%
on the dry weight that corresponded to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 6% between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not statistically significant according
to the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flower and trim weight,
they saw the same thing, an increase as
[SPEAKER_00]: you increase the light intensity from 400
to 1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from 400 PPFD to 600 PPFD,
you had a 51% increase in trimmed flower
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the interesting thing, the total THC
and total active cannabinoids stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same with the exception of
that 700 average PPFD, which was that
[SPEAKER_00]: double-ended HPS light, had lower total
THC and active cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the total terpene concentrations
were the same across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of the light intensity,
including that double-ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting that terpene
concentration will stay the same
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of light technology or light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we go from HPS to LED, then we see
an increase in cannabinoid percentage from
[SPEAKER_02]: 19% cannabinoids with HPS to around 21 or
21.5 with LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then I know the next slide that
she showed was one of your favorites from
[SPEAKER_00]: the poll conference, looking at the grams
per watt and grams per square foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gave us the amount of money
generated per light, and then the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of money generated minus your power
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the LEDs really shined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like at 1200 PPFD, you were at
1.2 grams per watt, but 72 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the most efficient light was the 400
PPFD LED light at 1.7 grams per watt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we're only getting 34.2 grams per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Square foot is just such an important
aspect when we're talking about commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production, so getting in that extra cost,
even though your grams per watt drops,
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to make it well worth it,
going with the more powerful light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and according to them, the grams per
watt change, they considered it
[SPEAKER_02]: statistically significant, but as we go
from 400 PPFD to 600 PPFD to 800 PPFD with
[SPEAKER_02]: LED, the grams per watt go from 1.7 to 1.5
to 1.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grams per watt doesn't change that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's statistically significant,
but still the changes are really small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the sweet spot, according to
this data set, the sweet spot seems to be
[SPEAKER_02]: 800 PPFD to achieve 66 grams per square
foot, because if we have the PPFD from 800
[SPEAKER_02]: to 400, we almost exactly have the grams
per square foot, so very similar
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: 800 PPFD seems to be the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going up to 1200 PPFD, the efficiency goes
down from 1.6 grams per watt to 1.2 grams
[SPEAKER_02]: per watt, so it's a pretty big drop in
efficiency, but the grams per square foot
[SPEAKER_02]: goes from 66 to 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're getting an extra 0.2 pounds
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: By increasing that and an extra 400 PPFD,
which in the case of cannabis being such a
[SPEAKER_00]: high yield crop, that seems well worth it
in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their income minus the cost of power shows
that running at this exceptionally high
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFD of 1200 is more profitable if the
pound price is based off of 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we change that pound price to 1600,
which might be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable, then we might not see a
benefit from going up to these higher
[SPEAKER_02]: light intensities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels best to run the lighting at an
intensity which will give us a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still feel like 800 or maybe 1000 PPFD
is our target, but this is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of one strain, this hazy OG,
and we're going to see cultivars react
[SPEAKER_02]: very differently to light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a really preliminary study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been peer reviewed or
replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a lot more research,
but it is interesting that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to look at this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go to the next slide,
which looks at cost recovery, when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about LED versus HPS, and they compared
that 700 PPFD, double ended HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: at $400 for that fixture versus say the
Fluence fixture at 800 PPFD, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cost you almost $1,300,
to outfit a room, it's a difference of
[SPEAKER_00]: $46,000 per room for that Fluence light
versus $14,500 for that HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes down to your power
usage per room, at 21 cents a watt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at $3,500 to run that
Fluence light versus $5,300 to run that
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your power plus fixture, they have the
calculations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up, over time,
saving money by reducing your energy
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, but it is an initial
investment that's going to be a lot higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you stuck with that double ended
HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whether you're running the lights,
running LED lighting at 800 PPFD or 1200
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFD versus the average of 700 PPFD with
DEHPS, it's going to be a wash in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The profitability of using LEDs versus
HPS, it's going to be a wash from that
[SPEAKER_02]: first crop, but in subsequent harvests,
we're looking at this 25 to $38,000
[SPEAKER_02]: increase, if we're looking at the same
chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be cumulative over five
to six turns per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The LEDs get much more profitable to run
whether we decide the 1200 PPFD is worth
[SPEAKER_02]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slightly increasing the light
intensity in PPFD with the LEDs is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't come up a number right now,
but it's looking like 10%, 10% more
[SPEAKER_02]: profitable to use LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other thing I found interesting
about this is with the LEDs, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using organic methods, if you're going
with this multi-tiered LED, hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, you can double stack the lights,
which allows you to effectively double the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of square footage in a given room
if the facility has a decent height
[SPEAKER_00]: because the LEDs don't generate the same
level of heat that you're getting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: double-ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be as far away from the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're definitely more efficient
and they definitely create less heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat they generate isn't being
projected out from the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: DEHPS are going to project that heat,
that infrared from the light onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy when the majority of the heat from
the LED is coming off the heat sink on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fixture itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs really make double stacking possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Racking is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs aren't so cheap either, but
regardless of your cost of real estate,
[SPEAKER_02]: just building out a facility with the
proper HVAC and air movement, double
[SPEAKER_02]: stacking just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely shows a return within a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green organic Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was David Bernard Perron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm butchering his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: David Bernard Perron.
[SPEAKER_00]: His talk was on the future of organic
cannabis production at a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to highlight a little bit that
we learned from that talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to David, it looks like the green
organic Dutchman has chosen to go with a
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% organic program because David's
coming from Whistler Medical Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Company, which is the first certified
organic cannabis farm in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that bringing David on
with his experience and skillset gave them
[SPEAKER_02]: the confidence to commit to doing a 100%
organic facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really interesting about this place
is they're creating a planting density and
[SPEAKER_02]: a, how do I say this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creating the most technologically
advanced organic production facility that
[SPEAKER_02]: I know of.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using concepts that draw from
synthetic nutrients, draw from
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional agriculture in that they look
at soil mineralization and look at mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: balance and mineral ratios, but they're
also committed to using all organic
[SPEAKER_02]: approved inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really biologically driven farm
and they're looking at how they can make
[SPEAKER_02]: this most efficient using technology,
whether they're looking at mineral
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis, like leaf tissue analysis,
or looking at how they can automate the
[SPEAKER_02]: processes of transplanting or irrigation,
fertigation, recycling, runoff of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really taking, I think what's
interesting about what a lot of people we
[SPEAKER_02]: like are into is this merging of soil
chemistry and soil biology or biointensive
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to take that to scale, they know
that they will periodically have runoff
[SPEAKER_02]: and that runoff is going to be captured
and aerated and tested and amended and
[SPEAKER_02]: added back into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are they not wasting water or
wasting nutrients, they're conserving all
[SPEAKER_02]: those, they're keeping those all within
the facility, but they're using all the
[SPEAKER_02]: technology available to do it as
efficiently and as intelligently as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible to maintain these narrow ratios
that we've developed in soil minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this merging of technology that's
really interesting and this idea of using
[SPEAKER_00]: living soils in controlled horticulture
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a proof of concept based off
of Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation
[SPEAKER_00]: where David was one of the head growers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to throw some numbers at listeners,
I pulled this off of the Green Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutchman website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at 150,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've raised over 41 and a half million
dollars for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over a hundred acres and they're
looking to have the capacity to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: 14,000 kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's crazy what these numbers
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's staggering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys are shaping up to be the
largest organic cannabis producer in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I feel pretty confident they're
going to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need them to be successful
because one of the other speakers there
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving on Kronos is got an even larger
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they had a, I think they
said it was a $200 million investment and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were, they're really taking over this
space up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to them speak, just hearing the,
just how intelligent they were and how
[SPEAKER_00]: business focused they were was really
interesting and scary kind of all at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about how they've
actually figured out how to, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical level, export the cannabis
that they're growing to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's opened up a whole nother market
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sitting on stage with some PhDs
and people with really, really smart guys
[SPEAKER_00]: with really strong horticulture
backgrounds and looking at everything as
[SPEAKER_00]: automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, it's all about lean
manufacturing and operational
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not interested in being organic,
but rather a pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to be sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, and they're looking at as
how do we reduce the number of touches on
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, it becomes a unit of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really this, it's really not so
much about the plant at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, about just, it sounds like
making a ton of money is really what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm pulling for David and
hoping that these guys can produce a model
[SPEAKER_00]: that shows that organics can compete on
the same level as hydroponics in
[SPEAKER_00]: production on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will just have to wait and see how
that all pans out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what's exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The level of automation and the budget
they have to do this at scale with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Organic Dutch Men, it's hard to wrap
your mind around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's exciting to me is that the
Green Organic Dutch Men system is based on
[SPEAKER_02]: an organic reusable substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a strictly bottom line
mentality, you're not concerned with
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not you discard the substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that matters is what is the cost to
discard the substrate and how much money
[SPEAKER_02]: does that make us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you live your life or if you run
your business just by the numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: that of course works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plenty of examples of that in
commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the majority of examples we have in
commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're trying to find an agricultural
paradigm which is truly sustainable and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing, perceiving substrate as disposable
to me is, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I consider it unintelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier just to throw stuff away and
then bring in a new substrate and treat it
[SPEAKER_02]: how you want, knowing that it'll be
discarded to actually develop a program
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're mindful enough of the
mineralization and your pesticide program,
[SPEAKER_02]: your IPM program, such that you can reuse
the soil indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're using coco coir or peat
moss, it doesn't matter because this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: single one-time purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Green Organic Dutch Men intends to
do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: At scale and use automation to compete
with these guys who have even more money
[SPEAKER_02]: and even more scale that don't really care
about the ecological impact or the carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint or the impact on species that
this sort of extractive approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture has.
[SPEAKER_02]: For T.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, the Green Organic Dutch Men,
to take this on, they're using Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: tables, which are like rolling benches,
which typically roll side to side,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really space efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch tables roll side to side and front
to back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take this four-by-four area,
which has plants in it, in a bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and move it to wherever you want in the
facility automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can rotate your crop through,
do perpetual harvesting, do efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting or efficient training or
pruning because the machinery can move the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that need to be worked on towards
the head house or towards the centralized
[SPEAKER_02]: area where the most hands-on work has to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to do that with an irrigation system
and with an organic IPM program is much
[SPEAKER_02]: more difficult than with a synthetic
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really are innovating hard in a lot
of aspects, but I think they're up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they even said that some of the
technology that they're going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be successful, it doesn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to have to create some of
it, especially around harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty staggering when you think
about the numbers that these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with in terms of their harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sounds like an investor meeting
with Elon Musk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, we don't know how we're going
to do it, but we're going to do it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be done in 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did kind of feel like I was at a Ted
talk for most of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will play a devil's advocate a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I am encouraged by with
people like Alice and Justice over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Outco and with Kronos is they're not going
to be excessively applying phosphates and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates and other mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not cost efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we'll see is less environmental
contamination of specifically phosphates
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with Alison about this that
evening and she was saying that their
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff in terms of the nutrient levels is
minimal, which to me is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be a chem grower,
if you're going to grow with mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, let's at least do it responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one good thing I think coming
out of all of this as we move to scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an excess amount of mineral
salts or if there's an excess amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that are coming out of organic
beds, it doesn't matter what your approach
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a runoff, if you have a waste
stream, it's a waste stream made out of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and water, which is what we're
trying to apply to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're a synthetic grower or an
organic grower, you should capture this
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff, test this runoff, amend it
appropriately and fertigate it back into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just funny that these synthetic
farmers assume there is a waste stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once there's runoff, they consider
that waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the organic minded people see that
runoff as a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving along here and not to be
outdone, the next speaker was Village
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hadn't heard of them, but they are
one of the largest greenhouse production
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in all of North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have greenhouses in the United
States, in Canada, in Mexico, and their
[SPEAKER_00]: offices are in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have over 200 acres of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember he put he put this slide up and
we're talking about beautiful glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally controlled greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking to do 25 acres of that
in cannabis as their sort of their first
[SPEAKER_00]: step into the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decide on Canada based on all the
politics and restrictions and laws
[SPEAKER_00]: currently going on between within North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the United States versus
Canada, they decided on Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's three huge players all in the
same room, growing massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the effect of these
sorts of farming farms are going to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller growing operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was my very first concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, man, I am so glad I'm not
trying to run a legal facility up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how would you even compete with
these these other guys in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really I don't know if you can compete
as a small scale cultivator or distributor
[SPEAKER_02]: or processor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's so I want to say it's it's
so WTO, you know, it's so big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The economy of scale of these producers
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just weeds out the small farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but we're in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, how are these mega
Canadian producers going to affect U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: rec producers?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you in Oregon, there's
already been the first major acquisition
[SPEAKER_02]: of Chalice Farms earlier this year,
I think for 10 million dollars,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were required by a Canadian
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the influence of Canadian scaled
producers aren't going to influence U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: producers because they're just not here
producing, but they are going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: way they're going to influence the market
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: is through acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's I guess it's something to be
mindful of that eventually it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get very big and consolidated,
just like most aspects, just like pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much every other sector of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something to make a plan for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do we how do producers find a
niche which makes it so they don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: scale to these unbelievable, these
unbelievable sizes just to compete?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these guys like, you know,
this tomato guy, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Village Farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Salina was the he was the VP of
Applied Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paul Salina from Village Farms,
they're going to convert a 25 acre
[SPEAKER_02]: glasshouse to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which seems like it could be disruptive
because he has the infrastructure already
[SPEAKER_02]: built.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has experience with the scale,
but he's growing tomatoes and tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's not that cannabis is so much
harder than tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that a lot of these people
assume that cannabis is just another crop
[SPEAKER_02]: like tomatoes or cucumbers or peppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way the cannabis has been bred
over the generations it hasn't been bred
[SPEAKER_02]: for disease resistance or pest resistance
or fungal pathogen resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been bred for yield and potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have these tender cultivars that
when we pack them into this massive
[SPEAKER_02]: facility where you really it's not
feasible to have someone scouting and
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling open each bud looking for
podritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These huge scaled facilities are going to
see enormous crop loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they're going to be doing
everything highly automated, highly
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanized when it comes to harvesting,
de-leafing, trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to see a lower quality
of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the real question is how much better is
craft cannabis than industrial cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And will the market support that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way I took it was we're kind
of moving in a few directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is going to be cultivated in a
very limited amount of ways moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have these huge suppliers
doing hydroponics and multi-tiered,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely multi-tiered LED setups
indoors or using greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have organic people cultivating like
what we're seeing with David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that'll be the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll have outdoor people like
Eddie down at Phantom Farms that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating large scale giant trees,
you know, like an outdoor crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like a farmer would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we'll have, you know,
probably that black market home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll really be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that these craft guys will be
able to survive unless the market demands
[SPEAKER_00]: it, unless we get enough public outcry
that says that we really want to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to preserve these jobs and we'll
buy based on a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I know that I like Gold
Leaf Gardens flower because of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it's grown and they've created this
reputation in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I think it's going to be
really, really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the price of cannabis is going to
drop dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have, it'll just be like when you
walk in the grocery store, you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Costco, you can get, you know,
bananas for like $2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane how cheap things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what your thoughts are on
that, but that's kind of the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my takeaway from this conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the most important thing
to be mindful of for producers is that
[SPEAKER_02]: margins are going to steadily increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to slowly shrink.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, I heard mentioned numerous times
that margins, like profit margins are
[SPEAKER_02]: typically one to 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And profit margins, farm to farm,
and cannabis vary so much because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: all learning how to balance nutrients and
provide the appropriate biology to use
[SPEAKER_02]: automation or use mechanical equipment to
do processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The profit margin is what's really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Producers have to keep their profit
margins as tight as possible, but my
[SPEAKER_02]: concern is that it's going to lower
quality and by quality, I don't just mean
[SPEAKER_02]: how it looks, I mean how it tastes and the
actual cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's more attention to detail,
we get a better cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like your attention to a garden
as a garden, you know, 100 square feet of
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes versus 100,000 square feet of
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to grow more tasty
tomatoes in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that taste is so important,
there's, I wish I could cite it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's research showing that tomato
breeding done with open pollination has
[SPEAKER_02]: bred these tomatoes that are the best
tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, that's what drove the
breeding was taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we got the technology to put
these tomatoes into whatever machine to
[SPEAKER_02]: analyze their nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that by breeding by taste,
we bred the most nutritious tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bred the most medicinal tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's important to me about
cannabis is that we maximize or optimize
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoid-interpreted profile
because that is why we use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we embrace it because it is
medicinal or it is psychotropic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, I've seen some small tomato
startups that are like two to 10 acres or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe five to 20 acres, typically under
plastic or under glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are scales that are affordable
to, you know, to, I don't know how you say
[SPEAKER_02]: it, like normal people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that if you produce a tomato that just
tastes better than everyone else's tomato,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can create a market niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sell directly to restaurants or
you can have a presence in the farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: markets and people will seek you out and
you'll develop a name for yourself just
[SPEAKER_02]: because your tomatoes taste better than
any other tomato you've come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Kraft Cannabis is right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people who do business and run their
farm the way they do because they love it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have a passion for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really shows in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hate to see a lot of these smaller
companies go away that are doing really
[SPEAKER_00]: good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because the cost to stay
technologically competitive becomes too
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, worst case scenario is that
cannabis producers are forced to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: at a very narrow margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the upside of that is that the most
economical way to grow is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: ecological way to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we find ourselves in a commodity
cannabis economy, we'll find full season
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor becoming the most relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those growers to enjoy an economy
of scale, they simply have to create a
[SPEAKER_02]: co-op or create a distribution entity
where they can pool their product and sell
[SPEAKER_02]: it in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the producers don't have to be
concerned or don't have to deal with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cost of marketing or processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just focus on doing their job or they
focus on running their production with the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest ecological and economical impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is another reason that we need some
sort of certification in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: organics so that we have another way of
differentiating out plants that were grown
[SPEAKER_00]: organically for consumers to feel
confident in the quality and safety of
[SPEAKER_00]: their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now there's a lot in the
Washington rec market that I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: trust simply because I know the
regulations aren't able to control,
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't able to do effective regulation on
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there's companies out
there that are taking advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've seen a million recalls or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen dozens of recalls or upwards of
a hundred recalls across the nation from
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide tainted cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we enter this economy where the
margins are really tight, like a one to
[SPEAKER_02]: five percent profit margin, we're going to
see a lot of producers that are tempted or
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling forced to do certain agricultural
or utilize certain agricultural practices
[SPEAKER_02]: to push that yield up X percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so rather than waiting for the
government to regulate us, if the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: regulates itself, like Certified Kind or
the Renewable Innovation Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we use these regulatory protocols
bodies that have grown out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, then we can assure that
producers that stick to their ethics can
[SPEAKER_02]: be compensated appropriately and maintain
their margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, you know, if Farm X and Farm Y both
have a five percent margin, but Farm X has
[SPEAKER_02]: a higher cost of production because they
stick to organic methods, then they should
[SPEAKER_02]: be compensated for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't mean that the organic
cannabis would be twice as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll only be 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: More expensive or 15 percent more
expensive, which will ultimately be a
[SPEAKER_02]: nominal increase in in a retail price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's a you pay a premium
for organic products already on the
[SPEAKER_00]: produce side because you believe in that
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I well, you and I have the fortunate
circumstance of being good friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Black, who owns Certified Kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the standards to which he's
holding growers that are using his
[SPEAKER_00]: certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would happily pay 20 percent more in
a rec store for that certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being that the certification
would pay for itself for that grower in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that the public would recognize
that and say, hey, it's important to me to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that someone is looking out over this
farm and actually, I guess, double
[SPEAKER_00]: checking and reassuring me that what
they're claiming is accurate and they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't using any inputs that aren't
organic and they're not spraying any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that they're known carcinogens
and only approved for use on ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing the testing that right now that
the states just can't keep up with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I'm friends with Andrew Black
and he's an amazing man, very high
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, he wants he wants to
certify more farms so he can get his
[SPEAKER_02]: annual certification fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he won't certify a farm if it doesn't
meet the organic standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole point of this, like the the
industry that he's supporting or the
[SPEAKER_02]: market that he's supporting is people who
do the work, which is a lot of it's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of intellectual work to assure that you
can create an organic product to the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic standard and make it competitive
in this in this free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the game really is to stick to your
ethics and lower cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we're on the subject,
I actually did interview Andrew,
[SPEAKER_00]: but both of us agreed that the
conversation just didn't flow all that
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exciting topic for a lot of
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about it, I wouldn't
mind touching on it briefly, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you were looking into setting
up a certification a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you talk about some of the
challenges around certification just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for a minute or two and give
people a background onto it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had I had no idea what went into
a certification at all for setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: company like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I when I set out to develop my own
certification for cannabis, I thought that
[SPEAKER_02]: I could simplify the standard and be clear
about no synthetic inputs and just make it
[SPEAKER_02]: very easy to understand the standards and
to condense the hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: pages that must be digested or referenced
to run an organic program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I condensed that into a page or
a sheet or a paragraph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I realize is that it's an ideal
and it can happen like you can use no
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can practice regenerative model with
no synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use onsite or local resources to
provide for your fertility and your pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is the exception, not the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most important thing, which I said
before, is that organic agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative, sustainable, however you say
it, this must become the norm and this
[SPEAKER_02]: must compete and displace synthetic
unsustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to be a bit pragmatic in
that minute amounts of synthetic nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: can be utilized so we can have crop yields
and crop quality in an organic program
[SPEAKER_02]: that can compete and displace the
synthetic paradigm that we're living in
[SPEAKER_02]: now, which is, you know, destroying
topsoil and creating large amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff and poisoning farm workers,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't disagree with anything you're
saying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get back to the topic of this
conference and I want to save my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker for last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to jump out of order here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the last panels I heard from was
Michael Williams, director of operations
[SPEAKER_00]: at Flourish and Harborside Health Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Culberson, director of cultivation at
Columbia Care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jeremy Plum, who's out of
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's co-founder and director of
cultivation at Pharma and Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three of them were up there
talking about genetics, chemotype
[SPEAKER_00]: expression, and some of the medicinal
value and research that's being done
[SPEAKER_00]: around these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
what your takeaways were from their panel?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the topic of conversation after
their presentation was genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is genetic drift an issue with clonal
propagation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And should we be really motivated to move
from normal clonal propagation to micro
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation, tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: And even those guys on stage, they had,
I feel like they each touched on the issue
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of them seemed to backpedal
around this genetic drift term because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just not an accurate term for why
we're attracted to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really happening here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that the major problem is not
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, because we're not growing
cannabis from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow true to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that term genetic drift is not accurate
in terms of the mutations that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing from just a terminology
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really do need a new word for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that they were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what seems to be really happening is
that people are cloning from unhealthy
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're seeing the
degradation in quality over time or in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth and health and cannabinoid
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to encourage people to
make sure that they have really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy mother plants prior to
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I've seen in a
lot of the facilities I visit is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother room is not the best looking room
in the facility and it really needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeremy, I believe, was the one talking
about how he likes to even have a
[SPEAKER_00]: redundant mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's willing to dedicate a whole
nother space just to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving genetics and keeping up the
quality of the genetics because clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation is still the standard in the
industry as tissue culture is slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are doing more research around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing they talked about that
was interesting, I hadn't heard the term
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but chain cloning, the idea of
cloning your next crop off of your
[SPEAKER_00]: previous crop before you put them into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the danger with that is really the
idea of all the disease you're spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to keep one or a handful
of mother plants really, really healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and bug free than it is to try and
maintain that across the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be just perpetuating your
disease problems that way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look into tissue culture,
you understand what the benefits are of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and the potential of it to lower cost
production and to increase how many crops
[SPEAKER_02]: per year a producer can produce,
whether it is indoors or in a light
[SPEAKER_02]: deprivation greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the technology is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Implementing it at a small scale is really
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Implementing it at a large scale is,
I'm not saying it's easy, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that tissue culture is efficient
is at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that every farm or any like
one acre farmers and have a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: production facility, I think is really,
it's really idealistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not naive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is idealistic because there's a long
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes with TC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we see TC become part of the
industry, it's not going to be in a
[SPEAKER_02]: decentralized way at first because of the
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason people are so attracted
to it is because a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they're new or advanced or very
experienced, have this sort of like knee
[SPEAKER_02]: jerk reaction to taking a clone of a clone
of a clone of a clone, because they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're going to experience genetic
degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a clone of a clone of a clone does
not degrade genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will maintain genetics just fine over
enormous amounts of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if your cloning process is not
consistent and you're experiencing or
[SPEAKER_02]: you're creating stressed out plants and
numerous of these generations,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that could damage the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the issue here is not that we need to
move away from consecutive cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to move to TC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue really is that we need to get
better at propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other concern too is that as we get
these larger scale facilities and fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer companies in the cannabis industry,
we may lose some of that genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: because right now in history probably
exists the largest amount of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity around cannabis that has ever
existed in the world since the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hope is that we can maintain and
grow a little bit more on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have people like the people on
this panel, like Jeremy and Michael,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are growing out hundreds of
chemotypes and selecting for cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to be higher in CBG or
contain different medicinal properties as
[SPEAKER_00]: we learn more and more about the effects
of these different cannabinoids on humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and on different diseases that we're
facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hope is that we continue to grow
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems to me, and not being a
medical patient who relies on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say a hundred percent,
but I've heard this story where people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are patients will say, you know,
I really only get good results from this
[SPEAKER_00]: one cultivar grown by this one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I stay with this brand because it
really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps my treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I hope we can
maintain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard good research presented around
what cannabinoids ratio gives relief to
[SPEAKER_02]: certain medical symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you need a one to one CBD to THC
ratio, or maybe a two to one or a one to
[SPEAKER_02]: two, or maybe it's a 10 to one or a one to
10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this really is based on people's
endogenous endocannabinoid system and what
[SPEAKER_02]: symptom they're trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do need this diversity of cultivars
or chemotypes because that is what solves
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't just about like this strain
tastes so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to maintain this, like the skunky
pineapple flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really it's that we found this cultivar
that has this cannabinoid ratio or this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid terpenoid profile that will
relieve the symptoms of X illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just so valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never, I don't feel like we've ever
come across a plant that has this
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity of chemotypes and that the
chemotypes are so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: To specific illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that being said, in the interest of
not letting this podcast go too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have saved the best for last in my
opinion, the one that I'm most excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still working to get her on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Suzanne Wainwright Evans, also known
as the bug lady, that's not an insult.
[SPEAKER_00]: She refers to herself that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: She, I had never heard her speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaya, you've obviously had conversations
with her and I remember you telling me how
[SPEAKER_00]: excited you were the first time you heard
her speak at CannaCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave a really good talk and I kind of
wanted to go through that one in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more depth than we did with some of the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and start off with some of
my notes because I took pretty extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: notes on this one and feel free to jump in
where you feel appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she started talking about some of the
reasons for using beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things she talked
about was worker safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're reducing pesticide sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to help protect the human
workers in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to reduce the amount of
pesticide resistance that we're already
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, if you spray the same thing
for your spider mites, cycle after cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will build up resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also will help with
limitations that we're seeing both on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory level, but also from public
outcry or public opinion in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide residues on our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that she said in getting
started with beneficial insects was to
[SPEAKER_00]: form a relationship with someone who knows
what they're doing and what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me seems like the most
important, the most important tip that she
[SPEAKER_00]: gave right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she said, commit to scouting your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to look really close to
your plants and keep an eye on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on so you can get an accurate
identification of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interesting enough, she was saying
how, you know, depending on if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with a dirt floor or a concrete
floor or a gravel floor can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: affect what her recommendations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as simple as saying this bug
eats this bug or this bug survives in this
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental condition or lighting or
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you actually have to really have a
pretty high level of knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: entomology to successfully implement these
bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these systems that you have to
be cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing production, like if
you're growing in pots versus in beds,
[SPEAKER_02]: then the ability for those bio controls to
cover the space is much different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only only so many bio controls can
move from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a contiguous soil
underneath your canopy, then these bio
[SPEAKER_02]: controls can move across the landscape and
colonize the space much more effectively
[SPEAKER_02]: than if you have individual pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea it depends on the bio
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some bio controls, you're assuming they
will not create a breeding population and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to use an inundated release
program to assure that you have proper
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other bio controls will naturalize in the
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the space is such that they can
navigate the square footage, like in a bed
[SPEAKER_02]: or in long rows, certain bio controls like
soil dwelling, soil dwelling predators
[SPEAKER_02]: will be able to move across that space and
you can develop a breeding population
[SPEAKER_02]: which becomes naturalized in that
greenhouse or in that site if the floor
[SPEAKER_02]: plan is conducive to that predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she talked about how we need to also
improve our practices as growers and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading all of these bugs around,
especially with our cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hemp russet mite doesn't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's being spread so rapidly is
because people keep bringing it into their
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with new cuts and new clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things she talked about
with that is we need to do a better job of
[SPEAKER_00]: bio control with our management strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had talked about dipping cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally she had some photos of a
colander with the plant tissue or your
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting inside of it and dipping that into
the industry standard apparently is
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanigard with Root Shield, which is a
trichoderma product.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also mentioned Sufoil X is another one
that you could potentially use as a dip,
[SPEAKER_00]: though they're currently not certified for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keeping your tools clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had a great photo of some clippers
and there were three different stages on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was the sanitizer and
then the second one was the second
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitizer to remove the larger plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one was a clean wash so
that you could move from room to room or
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to plant without spreading any of
these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she also mentions pulling dying
foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having dying leaves there that
could be potential habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly being really selective on
who enters your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she talked about how she goes to a lot
of facilities and they never even ask her
[SPEAKER_00]: where she's been or what she's wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ever put on coveralls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always very careful when I go out on a
consult to make sure that my clothes are
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been in any other cannabis
plants or any other vector plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know over at Goldleaf they have a
floor mat with a sanitizing solution in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that you step into before you walk
into a room and they also limit room to
[SPEAKER_00]: room movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the potential that you may have
picked something up, you're not carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: it into that next room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your workflow doesn't involve going into
multiple rooms in a given day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether you're running a facility
which has really strict biosecurity
[SPEAKER_02]: protocols where all employees must shower
and put on their bunny suit, their shoe
[SPEAKER_02]: covers and head covers, whether you have a
highly clean facility or a pretty loose
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, either way your flow,
your workflow throughout the day should
[SPEAKER_02]: start in the sections of your facility
which are cleanest and move throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: day towards the least clean space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not bringing, you could have
spider mites and veg which are easily
[SPEAKER_02]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have spider mites to flower,
it could ruin your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to think about how you
move through the facility throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: day and that you're not taking a minor
problem and tracking it into a space where
[SPEAKER_02]: it will become a major problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And scouting is the, I think it's the
foundation of IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of how sustainable or not
sustainable your IPM program is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to scout and get and create an
SOP around what is light pressure of this
[SPEAKER_02]: pest and what is medium pressure of this
pest and find out a way to quantify that
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly and easily and keep track of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever is in charge of running this
facility can look at this data and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: plan around your insecticide or IPM or
biosecurity protocol that keeps them below
[SPEAKER_02]: an economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the idea is not to have no pests,
it's to maintain pests below an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she talks about how it's really
important to keep records so you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: when your pest pressures are occurring,
how heavy they are, what you're seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things she mentioned is
that you don't have to know every pest out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to know the pest that you
end up having to deal with in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility consistently over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to know the
different life stages of not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: pests but also the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she uses the example of, let's see,
what was it here?
[SPEAKER_02]: On that tip of you only need to know so
many pests to do proper scouting,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel that at this point in my
life, if I am sent a photo of an insect
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've never seen before, I assume it's
not a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it was a pest, I would have
heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hard line on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I see a new insect, I will seek out the
information to find out if it's a pest or
[SPEAKER_02]: a predator.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's only so many cannabis pests
that we generally have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to come back to scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the example she gave was aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a little about aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that aphids can be color morphs,
which means that they can actually change
[SPEAKER_00]: the color that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something like a green peach aphid
isn't necessarily green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be red and isn't necessarily
going to be on a peach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to look at the
morphology, the characteristics of that
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid to determine what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing with aphids is they actually
suck the sugars out of the plant and exude
[SPEAKER_00]: this honeydew, which is the sugar that
then the ants come along and then wasps
[SPEAKER_00]: will eat that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get the sooty mold that will
develop on the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we have major insecticide
resistance on whiteflies and western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was saying a lot of the
conferences she's going to on entomology,
[SPEAKER_00]: they think aphids will be the next wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interesting enough, aphids give live
birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the mom is resistant to insecticide,
these kids that are an exact clone of her
[SPEAKER_00]: will be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had a video of a green lacewing
sucking the inside, and it's an immature,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's juvenile stage, sorry,
juvenile stage, sucking the inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, leaving these dead bodies behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important to know if something
is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on what bio control your agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know you're applying lacewings,
then you should be seeing these leftover
[SPEAKER_00]: skins or shriveled versions of aphids that
are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really have to get down in
there and start identifying these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also showed a video of a predatory
mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if it was californicus or
persimilis or philassus, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding on a red mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what kind of spider mite it
was, but it was red in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it fed on the red mite,
it took on, as a predatory mite fed on the
[SPEAKER_02]: red mite, it took on the color of the red
mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these mites are the same size,
same shape, and then they can periodically
[SPEAKER_02]: be the same color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes scouting a much more complex
task, because you really have to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the eggs and see if there are exclusively
spider mite eggs on the leaf or if there
[SPEAKER_02]: are predatory mites there also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that I think is really much
less intellectual and more applied is
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at how spider mites move across a
canopy, because many people have seen
[SPEAKER_02]: spider mites sweep across a canopy very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a proper inundative biocontrol
release program, you can observe or you
[SPEAKER_02]: can scout and monitor spider mite hotspots
that don't seem to spread, because there
[SPEAKER_02]: are predators in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you take that leaf off and you see
those pests on the leaf, you really have
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at it, and you're not just looking
for how many pests there are, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to see if there's a predator
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scouting is not just about scouting for
pests, it's about scouting for predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she did talk more about some of the
tools with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll want to have a hand lens,
which is a bang board, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like the top of a white cooler
for lack of a better definition that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: visually describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says it's much better to knock the
bugs off the plants onto the board where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see them screwing around than
trying to lift up the undersides of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to take photos with,
whether it's a camera or your cell phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're writing this stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she did recommend a handheld
microscope that hooks up to USB that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote down somewhere in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know off the top of
your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dino light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, there's a lot of USB
microscopes on the market, but Dino light
[SPEAKER_02]: sells scopes ranging from $50 to $1,400,
depending on the resolution and depth of
[SPEAKER_02]: field that you desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she recommended a $150 Dino light and
sound horticulture also has a Dino light
[SPEAKER_02]: in their website that I think is around
150 or $250.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sufficient to take really nice,
really high resolution photos of pests or
[SPEAKER_02]: predators so that you can document them,
track them and submit the photos to
[SPEAKER_02]: entomologists or insectaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, so everyone can be sure of
what the pest problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads us back to identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, do not guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it makes a big deference what you're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she used thrips as an example there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that Echinothrips require a
different mode of action than Western
[SPEAKER_00]: flower thrips and beneficial nematodes
don't work on Echinothrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go in dealing with thrips and
you just, you call up a company and they
[SPEAKER_00]: say, you tell them you have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't ask you what kind of thrips
that they are, then you shouldn't be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: business with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was very adamant about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is also knowing this
plant pest life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the Western flower thrip,
everyone targets the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you spray the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that, but they have other life
stages that are actually in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was something I wasn't aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to treat all stages if we
really want to manage this pest over time
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identification, she said, don't guess
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask people on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like a no brainer, but I can't tell
you how many times I've seen that in
[SPEAKER_00]: forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll put up one bug and they'll get
20 answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are confident too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the craziest part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like, they know what it is,
but take photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get one of those dinolite
magnifiers and you can put the insects in
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and mail them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you need to get an ID or take
them to an expert, you don't have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a leaf if it's cannabis that's illegal or
you can't ship it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to get an
identification too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was, when I was, when I was deep in
the broad mite research, the, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: the university research I found on it was
to soak or to dip a leaf into alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all the broad mites we washed off
into it and they would die and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll follow the suspension relatively
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can, if you're dipping a,
you know, say you dip four leaves into the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol solution and then you can count
the broad mites that come out of it or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever your pest is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can count those and figure,
Oh, okay, I have this many pests per leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whatever you're sampling or
monitoring protocol, as long as you do it
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently, you've got a constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your only variable is the actual
quantity of pests that you're finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that she talked about too
was pesticide compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says there is a lot of
compatibility between many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and beneficial, uh,
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put the list up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's AgriBio, BASF, BioBest,
BioLine, uh, Copert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these companies have, um, mobile apps
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put in the generic name or
even the brand in some cases of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the effects on a
given species of insect like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: scimitus or California kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll say, you know, whether it's
going to kill all of them, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 75% or less than 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a different, if you're doing
a foliar application versus an irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: application of that pesticide,
it's a great way to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll tell you how long you need to
wait before you can reintroduce those
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, which is really
important because you don't want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and then bring in these beneficial
insects and there's going to be lingering
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of that spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may not get, you know,
you may just be killing off whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: just spent money on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, yeah, the databases that they've
built for this pesticide compatibility
[SPEAKER_02]: with biocontrols are really great,
but the majority of the data is centered
[SPEAKER_02]: around chemical insecticides, much of
which are not permitted to be used on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's still use for,
it's definitely worth digging into those
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, and getting as much information
as you can from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really want to see in the,
in the next few years is not just
[SPEAKER_02]: compatibility as in what will create pest
mortality, but what insecticides could be
[SPEAKER_02]: a deterrent because there's, there's,
you know, there's products like Neem,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a fantastic insecticide and
anti-feedant, but Neem has a residual
[SPEAKER_02]: effect that is not insecticidal per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a deterrent or an anti-feedant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could spray Neem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you spray a soap product or an
oil product the following day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be safe to apply predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but if you were to spray Neem the
following day, you could apply predators
[SPEAKER_02]: and it wouldn't kill them, but it might
make them all walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really up to, up to cannabis
producers to apply these biocontrols and
[SPEAKER_02]: observe their habits afterwards because we
really are on the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of what, what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly enough, we talked about
Neem and she said that Neem oil is not her
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite because it will actually prevent
a large majority of the eggs and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these beneficial predatory mites from
hatching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she much prefers light paraffin based
sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in particular, stuff oil X I'm working
with them, trying to get set up as a
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor with them right now,
but they're small size containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're really designed for
large scale commercial greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking for solutions for smaller
growers is something that we're currently
[SPEAKER_00]: working on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping to have Suzanne give more
feedback onto how these different sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: affect, you know, various predatory mites,
but that's something you can do yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: too at home and we can, we can all learn
together, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, and that, that bang board that
she recommended, like she was her example
[SPEAKER_02]: was the lid of the styrofoam cooler that
the predators arrive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got edges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that it's white is crucial
because I've experienced, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: receiving biocontrols in the mail,
seeing them all walk around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as I put it on the leaves of
the plant, I can't see them with the naked
[SPEAKER_02]: eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see them when they're on the,
when they're in a container or on a white
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once they're on the green leaf,
they're, they're microscopic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need a hand lens to see them at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bang board is this really,
it's so simple, but it's just an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: tool to, to, uh, properly scout or
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings up another point.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says she gives a whole hour long talk
just on insect suppliers, because if you,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you buy it,
it may go from one person to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the insects get to you,
they may already be dead or they may be so
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out that they're not going to
want to eat or really do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you as the consumer needs to learn how
to, how to identify healthy, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy insects as they arrive at your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really a lot of knowledge that
goes into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite amazing how much you have to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's never ending.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, um, with, with,
with, uh, you get a, you get a package of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of predatory mites in the mail and you're
trying to count them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are there a thousand in this
container?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I, and I use this similar,
the similar technique that I learned from
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at compost tea, where I'm looking
at a, looking at a viewing area and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, all right, how many bacteria in this
viewing area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, is it 50?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 500?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a thousand?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you learn to look at a corner,
like a quarter of that viewing area and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, okay, well there's 250 in that
viewing and a quarter of the viewing area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of a thousand in this,
in this total viewing area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so developing these little,
these little tricks to quickly count.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like if you need to count how
many leaves on a plant, you count a small,
[SPEAKER_02]: a representative section and multiply it
across the square footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, so you can do this sort of
observation really quickly and come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with pretty accurate estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it so important to identify how many
there are just to know that they're alive
[SPEAKER_00]: and active and healthy upon arrival?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say you want to be, if,
if, if you ordered 5,000 predatory mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you should be able to count up close
to 5,000 quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're only counting about a thousand,
it's like, well, you know, I paid,
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid for 5,000, I only got 1,000 and you
know, 1,000 might be still be plenty,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those predators, if, if, if a fifth of
them know it, which I say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: if a fifth of them have already died,
then the ones that are left are starving
[SPEAKER_02]: and they probably don't have very much
longer to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're doing these biocontrol
releases, we're not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not necessarily desiring the
predators to naturalize because these
[SPEAKER_02]: really short crop cycles are really high
value crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our, our, our approach is to
release predators every week or two,
[SPEAKER_02]: or at least every four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're not counting on them and
developing a breeding population.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just counting on them having the
energy and the reserves, the food reserves
[SPEAKER_02]: to walk around for a week or two before
they starve to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're, you know, three days away from
starving to death, then we're not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: our money's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's something she talked about
that I hadn't really thought about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she said, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to build ecology for
these beneficial mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to starve to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gives an example of persimilis
needs higher humidity for their eggs to
[SPEAKER_00]: hatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're introducing them every week
or every two weeks, and it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: if their eggs are hatching, the adults can
still do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just look at that,
you know, the, the general charts that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there on persimilis and say,
this isn't going to work in my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where having that expert is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, her knowledge was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get back to what she had to
say about compost tea at the very end of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but I want to finish up on the notes
that I do have that from her talk during
[SPEAKER_00]: the, during the conference itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she said there was very limited
research on how lighting affects these
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research still needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to be a big difference
though, between HBS and LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said in natural light, like in a
greenhouse, you want your sticky cards
[SPEAKER_00]: facing south to get optimal collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what that is in an indoor
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said the research isn't there yet,
but I had never thought about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that you're supposed to have
your, your sticky cards facing south?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it never even occurred to me,
but it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the most light from the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in North America, I should
probably specify that if you're in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're very, uh, what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern hemisphere.
Topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Centric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern hemisphere centric, but in the
sticky cards, the sticky cards do trap a
[SPEAKER_02]: fair amount of pests, but they're not
really, they're not, they're not created
[SPEAKER_02]: or marketed as a bio control to market it
as a monitoring tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why there's a grid on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day or every three days or every
week, however, whatever program you
[SPEAKER_02]: develop, you count and the squares are
useful as you don't have to count every
[SPEAKER_02]: single bug on the card.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just count a few squares or a
representative amount of squares and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can monitor what your pest pressure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to catch pests with
sticky, with a sticky product,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you should be using a sticky banner,
which is, you know, like a three inch wide
[SPEAKER_02]: by thousand foot long roll, which is
really cost effective and easy to string
[SPEAKER_02]: up between stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really, it's really easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me touch on the last few points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to talk a little bit about
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of her notes that she had was
Aureus, which is the pirate bug,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe she was talking about how they
have pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banker plants with pollen because they
need the pollen to survive and you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen now, but really you can grow
the plants that they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go out there and eat,
then they'll come back to the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you keep them, keep them
alive in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best plant she said is a pepper
variety called purple flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to grow the highest
amounts of Aureus using that, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing was that she loves
the slow release sachets.
[SPEAKER_00]: She thinks they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love time release sachets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that we were saying that you want
your bugs to be fresh and not about to
[SPEAKER_02]: starve to death because they can be
fasting for, I don't know exactly how
[SPEAKER_02]: much, but I know two to four weeks they
can be without a food source and still
[SPEAKER_02]: stay alive and keep on looking for looking
for prey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, the, the pepper plant as a pollen
source for your predators is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because pepper plants are,
you know, broad mites love pepper plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my observation, I've seen broad,
you know, typically broad mites are found
[SPEAKER_02]: on the lower side of the leaf,
but on pepper plants, I find them in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in relatively similar levels on the top
side and the bottom side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's when you're putting a pepper leaf
under the microscope, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much easier to look at a pepper leaf
than it is to look at a cannabis leaf and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're scouting and the broad mites are
attracted to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the top of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a great indicator plant also
for certain pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, I learned so much from her
in that one hour talk and I also learned
[SPEAKER_00]: how much I don't know, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a side note, I've sort of been
wooing her to try and come on this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully, hopefully we'll still get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't said no or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm hoping to follow up and maybe
get her on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things she said,
she went to our website and she started
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at compost tea and her initial
thought there was, uh, which is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say is that compost tea,
there isn't enough peer reviewed science
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she doesn't promote it with growers
and she doesn't like them to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't know everything that all
the effects of compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she brought up some really valid
points from a scientific perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, we're trying to be
science-based in what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to use research and data to
drive the decisions that we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not out here to try and sell and
promote snake oil or things that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary or don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all, there's plenty of research
out there supporting the use of compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's plenty of research supporting,
uh, the role of microorganisms in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there aren't a lot of good peer
reviewed studies or really anything out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that I've seen that's definitive
regarding compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some thoughts on this,
but is there anything you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: before I comment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know, I know the problem with
people's problem with compost tea is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is people's problem with biochar and that
there's not, there's not a good science to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the use of compost tea or biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is not that compost tea and
biochar don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that how the compost tea or the
biochar is created and that's so variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's why we don't have good
science on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to disagree with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was just talking with Renell
Anderson over at Black Owl biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they actually are coming out with some
really good research, research from
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell and some of these ag universities
that she's hopefully be able to share,
[SPEAKER_00]: share with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I think biochar is a
little further along because they can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it more consistently if you know,
in her case where they're, they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: something called virgin forest slash,
which is the leftover debris after they
[SPEAKER_00]: log an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff is, oh, it's a potential
danger because it could catch fire and
[SPEAKER_00]: create a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to sequester the carbon
and create a usable product by burning it
[SPEAKER_00]: in these, you know, pyrolyzing it in these
kilns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll talk more about biochar with
her, but the big issue I see with compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea is, is something you touched on there
that it's inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting the same batch of tea
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we're not even getting the same
batch depending on how long we brew for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brewing cycle, can determine if we
have an excess of bacteria, if we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: excess of ciliates or protozoa,
flagellates, it's just not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any real research on that, it's going
to be hard to have good controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones I've seen really haven't done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her other concern was also pathogens in
compost tea, things like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, salmonella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been some research in that
regard, but again, you can make compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea wrong and the potential is there for
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potential is there for,
you know, something that may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful in terms of increasing your
nutrient cycling and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was an interesting point that
she brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that she was just very honest
and frank with me about her opinions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I can totally respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do see a lot of benefit to compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are cases where it's,
it's definitely worthwhile, but we do need
[SPEAKER_00]: more trials and studies on things like
this for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like your approach to compost
tea is assuring that the compost tea is
[SPEAKER_02]: aerobic and that excludes pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's all these different people
using different compost sources and
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea brewers, what do you think
determines whether a compost tea is safe
[SPEAKER_02]: or not safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few steps there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is yes, maintaining that
oxygen levels high enough, but things like
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli are facultative anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to choose a compost soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, that means something that's not
manure-based, though you could in theory
[SPEAKER_00]: use manure-based compost if they were
fully composted, but it's a little riskier
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're talking about a compost pile
that's massive and trying to eliminate a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria is really, really pretty
challenging, but it has to all generate a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a temperature of a heat above
131 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's a matter of having clean
inputs and controlling that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling our oxygen levels and make
sure we're not overwhelming our compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea brewer with too many food sources so
that the microorganisms are reproducing at
[SPEAKER_00]: a rate that we can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some science involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her other thing was when we were
talking about this, she's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the growers I work with,
you know, they're not, they're not that
[SPEAKER_00]: science-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to do all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a safe technology for her to
recommend based on the fact that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these other variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an interesting point and not one
that I had thought about as a perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a long time, because it's, I've been,
you know, so narrowly focused in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and seen compost tea as a
beneficial technology for so long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she brought up a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to
touch on regarding this conference that
[SPEAKER_00]: really sparked your interest or got you
excited?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the, the, the part that is
most, most like a, how do I say it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The most exciting to me and the most
affirming to me is that all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different technological advancements are
interdependent that we have to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to utilize high-tech lighting and
high-tech HVAC and, and, and use the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the latest utilized latest science
and bio controls and put all these things
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to have a sustainable
agricultural paradigm, especially if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love indoor agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love controlled environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the inspiring thing about this
conference was realizing that this,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it is affirmed to me that this truly
is the future of agriculture where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: increase yields a great amount and create
food and medicine for ourselves in a much
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller amount of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to continually or
continue to cut down the forest and
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy or degrade more lands in order to
provide for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it, it, it, it, it kind of
confirmed with me that this technological
[SPEAKER_02]: approach to agriculture will be a large
part of the solution to sustainable human
[SPEAKER_02]: settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a really good point for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I was most excited about was
just the amount of smart people in one
[SPEAKER_00]: room that were all, all focused on
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the amount of growing knowledge in
that room was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that so many of the people
there were open-minded to hearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, different points of view and all the
different styles of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had organic guys, we had hydro
guys, we had HVAC guys, and everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: really a specialist and, uh, an expert in
their own little part of the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly successful at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really exciting to me to see
because there was no, uh, as they talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, there was no secret sauce there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no one selling, you know,
particular bottled nutrient brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they wouldn't survive in a room like
that because those growers just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the, have the time or energy to,
to deal with those kinds of, those kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't afford to use those kinds of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, you know, frankly,
they're smart enough that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can figure it out for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see, uh, it's great to see
that level of involvement and energy all
[SPEAKER_00]: in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, I've never been around so many
people who are leaders in their field who
[SPEAKER_02]: are so unassuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was amazing that there was just
a lack of ego in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were so open-minded and
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love being able to go up and ask a
question and not, uh, not feel stupid for
[SPEAKER_00]: not knowing the answer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were like, you know,
people with PhDs, people who had been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were running million dollar
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing I want to ask you,
if you want to touch on it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I know you were doing a trial,
uh, recently that you were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overseeing, uh, using the led lighting,
the Fluence lights and beds, sort of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, proof of concept that we saw from
David with living soils under led lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what some
of your preliminary results were and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you were comparing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, uh, the Kisswell was one of the,
was one of the three beds you were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data is still coming in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to, I don't want to be too
firm on the numbers, but, um, we're,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we're getting data, uh, like 16 square
foot section by 16 square foot section,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is commonly referred to as a light,
even though, you know, 16 square feet is a
[SPEAKER_02]: light typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, even though we're using more,
um, led fixtures than that per square
[SPEAKER_02]: foot, but we're, uh, the comparison was
between Kiss soil and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_02]: water only soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing anywhere from a 37 to 75 gram
per square foot, which is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, depending on cultivar,
37 to 75 grams per square foot and 70 gra
[SPEAKER_02]: 75 grams per square foot under these led
lighting, uh, led lights is about 1.75
[SPEAKER_02]: grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it's just amazing yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the yields are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the efficiency is, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't seen the, the final
product myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, you know, the, the, I haven't,
you know, I haven't got any, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid turpenoid tests done yet,
but the look of it, the tricum density is
[SPEAKER_02]: superb and the nose on it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm more than pleased
with the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm kind of blown away by it and I
don't even want to, I feel, I feel weird
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it's all in, because I want to be
really clear about like what strain
[SPEAKER_02]: yielded what per square foot, but the
numbers coming in so far are, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the best I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just tease that then for a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't give it all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really fun time hanging out with
you this last weekend and I look forward
[SPEAKER_00]: to seeing you here again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fun, man.
