[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Dr. Jordan Zager.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan is an expert in natural product
biosynthesis and chemical analysis of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis resin compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Zager earned his PhD from Washington
State University, where his research set
[SPEAKER_02]: the stage for studying the regulatory
events governing gene expression in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and their effect on the
biosynthesis of trichome-bound
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early in his career, Jordan set his sights
on aggressively applying modern scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: methods to the medicinal and recreational
cannabis industry and to bring cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: the tools to become exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Zager is now the CEO and co-founder of
Dewey Scientific in Pullman, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Jordan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off talking a little bit about
your background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you share a little bit about how you
got into this type of research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my formal educational background,
I'm a biochemist who chose to study plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bachelor's of biochemistry and
molecular biology from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was there, I worked in a plant
biofuels lab where we were looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential crop for biodiesel production,
specifically looking at the oil quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds produced by this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was during that time, you know,
it was my college years, I found this love
[SPEAKER_00]: for biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a college student smoking weed and
sort of had this idea of let's merge these
[SPEAKER_00]: two things, let's do some biotech in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led me up to Washington State
University in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational cannabis had just become
legalized and they had a market at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a lab that studied terpene
biosynthesis in glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, I knew enough about
cannabis to know that that was very
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to sort of back up, right,
glandular trichomes are these little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular chemical factories that stand on
the leaf of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found on about 30% of all plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lab I entered for my doctorate
studied the metabolism in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically these structures,
these trichomes, they make essential oil
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which for the most part are
mono and sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those are famous in cannabis
because they provide each variety or
[SPEAKER_00]: strain with their own unique aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's gaining traction that
it's also these terpene compounds sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the user experience from strain
to strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's how I got into all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eventually was able to work with
cannabis genomics as part of my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And upon graduating with my doctorate in
plant biochemistry, went off and started
[SPEAKER_00]: Dewey Scientific, a cannabis focused
biotechnology company where we are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make cannabis better through credible
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what you're doing now with
Dewey Scientific?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, at Dewey Scientific, we are
implementing modern methods in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, leveraging the genome as much as
we can to identify markers that associate
[SPEAKER_00]: with certain traits and then make sure
these traits get into the varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: we develop and ultimately put onto the
market, both for other farmers to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a commercial brand,
Dewey Cannabis Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're located in Washington state where we
get a sort of market test, the varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that come out of our breeding program and
get consumer feedback directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing at Dewey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can you just touch briefly on,
so what you're doing is breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not necessarily doing any GMO stuff
at this point, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not directly putting genes from
other organisms into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not using various viral or
bacterial constructs to sort of manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we are doing is sequencing the
varieties we like, sequencing the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: of the varieties we like to sort of better
understand what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we know what we have,
we can start to make targeted and
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent breeding decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of the way that cannabis has
been bred and treated over the last 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 years through prohibition, breeders
have been very limited in their access to
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, their access to facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's sort of fallen behind other
horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at blueberry, there's a
thousand papers on blueberry resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: various pathogens, fungus, insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the prohibitory nature of
cannabis, no one's really quite gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really what we're
focused on, is just catching it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: these other horticultural species from an
understanding and then putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding into practice through smart
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a really good analogy
that you're using there, comparing it with
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable crops that we're more familiar
with, because I know when I go out to buy,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, an apple tree, I'm going to look for
what diseases are most prevalent in my
[SPEAKER_02]: area and then look for a particular
variety that I know is going to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: some resistance to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have a lot of issues with
rust around here, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: with pears.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that there's varieties I can
choose that are going to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant, that I'm going to have a better
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what you're getting in terms
of a flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just identifying what particular
markers may be most useful for someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by identifying, you can then
breed plants that have these traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that sort of what you're what you're
getting out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, without the genetic marker
component of this, the breeder is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: left to uncovering things visually as the
plant matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, cannabis is a relatively
quickly maturing plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to, say, an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the time burden there in
eight week flower cycle is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so much ground that we have to
make up in cannabis that we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: making decisions a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what genetic markers enable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have a genetic marker for,
say, powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that this gets
into all of our commercial variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the seedling stage, we can just take
a small little leaf sample, run a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR assay, and then we know which in this
population is powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can we can get rid of
everything that doesn't have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're, you know, at ease that all
these varieties that we're growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing are will be protected against
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just another tool of
essentially utilizing technology to speed
[SPEAKER_02]: up the process, because normally,
as traditionally as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd have to grow out all these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to evaluate them,
you know, qualitatively in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and the effects of, you know,
whatever, whatever effects that may
[SPEAKER_02]: synergistically occur with that particular
plant, how resistant it is to different
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases that may have been exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you may choose to clone or
reproduce it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this just gives you a lot more
information earlier on if you can identify
[SPEAKER_02]: these markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're saying is that we haven't
we don't we haven't identified all these
[SPEAKER_02]: markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know where on the genome,
you know, powdery mildew resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what we're going to talk about
today, is particular was located.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that sort of what you're what you're
saying there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing the the tools rooted in
molecular biology to accelerate plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, let's let's dive into the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to admit, you know,
breeding is not it's not my strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an area that I have a lot of
knowledge in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm probably going to be asking the
types of questions to help other listeners
[SPEAKER_02]: like myself that just haven't don't have
anywhere near your academic background on
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the paper itself, I will have a link
to directly in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Discovery and Genetic Mapping
of PM1, a powdery mildew resistance gene
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a paper produced by Dewey
Scientific in conjunction with Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have links directly to the
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there anything else you want to say
on that before we dive into the paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I just want to sort of
make clear, you know, I'm not an author on
[SPEAKER_00]: this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was work performed by my company,
Dewey Scientific, in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD, like you had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really just want to give a shout out
to Paul Mahalov and Andrea Garfinkel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this was something that was a
side project in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: publishing a public access research paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think most companies,
if they come across a market like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seal their lips and it's only theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for for us to advance the
cannabis industry, we really want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: developing tools that anybody can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Paul and Andrea just really took the
initiative on getting this work out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in the public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, the cannabis industry
is only going to advance if everybody can
[SPEAKER_00]: advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're holding this, you know,
close to our chest, we're the only ones
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're just not at that
stage in cannabis where there should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant market player.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to praise Paul and Andrea,
because this is really their brainchild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did a tremendous work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't confident in pronouncing their
last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for giving them a shout out
for this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you are sharing this,
I think that is important and something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I hope more companies will do so we
can further our overall knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's definitely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, let's let's dive into this
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is open access,
so you can read the paper yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a link on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just start off talking a little
bit about powdery mildew in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what what is powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, powdery mildew is a common term for a
lot of I shouldn't say a lot, but of many
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, you know, fungus that attack
the plant as a pathogen, meaning it will,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe act as a parasite,
maybe just wants to take advantage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to spread its spores so that the
fungus can live another generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But powdery mildew is one of these
pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been found on all sorts of
different crops, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, of course, it's cousin hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem in the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem anywhere where you have
fluctuating humidity during the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of any crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, you know, at least in
terms of our research on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are referring to the specific fungus
Golovinomyces ambrosiae, which is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found on our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some genetic sequencing and
found that it matches the general term of
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew found in Kentucky and Ohio
and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is just a general fungus that
attacks crops as they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to clarify, too,
that when you when you see PM on different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, that's not necessarily able to
cross all plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to necessarily see the
powdery mildew that we may find on our
[SPEAKER_02]: squash is the same species that's going to
be infecting our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something I wanted to point out for
listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it is a catch all, we know that
there's multiple species that infect
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it necessary, really, from a grower
perspective to actually identify the
[SPEAKER_02]: species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we treat these all fairly
synonymously in terms of our our approach
[SPEAKER_02]: to treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a particularly solid answer
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think some more research needs to go
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we do know that the species we
identified here in Washington is
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in Oregon, Kentucky and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that that there are
others in those locales that other species
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew that might be inhibiting
crop growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't done these sort of
artificial inoculations of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew species, mostly because of
sort of the biohazard that that poses
[SPEAKER_00]: bring that into a cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you touched a little bit on humidity
fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What conditions lead to higher spore
pressure and actual infection of the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that the fungus likes to produce
more spores and sort of rapidly take over
[SPEAKER_00]: a population are where you have,
you know, larger fluctuations in humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter if it's, you know,
through the day period or through the
[SPEAKER_00]: night period or in between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's generally when there's this
swing, you know, say you're getting up
[SPEAKER_00]: above 60 to 70% relative humidity and then
dropping down to, you know, say below 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that allows is for the spores to
be spread when the humidity is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that humidity comes back up,
the fungus can then begin to grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever those spores landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some simple ways for people to get
around this is just to have a stable
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in their grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what we've seen, you know,
this is a sample size of one, but at our
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, when we kept things,
you know, in the between 50 and 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw rather large reduction in powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really that swing that allows the
spores to spread and then the increase
[SPEAKER_00]: that then allows the fungus to flourish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I will comment just anecdotally
whenever growing giant pumpkins for years,
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed whenever I had a, you know,
a really heavy rainy day followed by a
[SPEAKER_02]: super sunny day, that was sort of that
trigger, those big swings was when I would
[SPEAKER_02]: see powdery mildew start to appear in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoors and obviously it's something we
can't control outdoors, but indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a big thing to control in terms of
the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that leads into genetics then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was your experimental design and
how did you discover what genetics to
[SPEAKER_02]: really start your project with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was sort of a circumstance of
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Dewey, we have a very nice plant
research facility and we have these really
[SPEAKER_00]: old growth chambers that they sort of look
like commercial refrigerators from like
[SPEAKER_00]: the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see big monster units.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a good job of regulating light and
temperature, but they sort of suck with
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't exchange a lot of air with the
external environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were just housing some of the
genetics that we were working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some, I don't know, a couple dozen
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in our early days, we were
leaving these chamber doors closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity was getting well up into the 80s
when the lights were off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the lights turned on,
it dried out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed one of our varieties,
this PMW 39, which commercially we call
[SPEAKER_00]: rain dance, was powdery mildew was not
growing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our breeder, Paul, sort of said,
hey, I think we might have a resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he did was he took this PMW 39,
very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it with the jumping jack
variety that was very susceptible or on
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher end of susceptibility and made
a breeding cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other background on PMW 39 and
jumping jack, PMW 39, while it was
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible, is a very low yielder
commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its THC content is generally sub 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really a commercially
appealing variety for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, jumping jack is a very
high yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regularly produces flour that tests
above 28% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of the farmer's dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it succumbed to powdery mildew
whenever it came into contact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Paul did was he crossed these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: He raised, I think it was just shy of 100
of those progeny, those children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took those children and put
them into that swampy, humid growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started scoring for powdery mildew
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw, and this is sort of
jumping back into high school biology with
[SPEAKER_00]: Gregor Mendel, was a segregation pattern
of one to two to one, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: classic Mendelian segregation,
as it's called, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think back to Punnett squares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you elaborate on that for those of us
that may not have taken these courses or
[SPEAKER_02]: really remember all of the stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I took a little bit on Mendel,
but I've promptly forgotten most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gregor Mendel was, I believe, a Belgian
monk in the late 1800s who was breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he saw was, you know,
I crossed the green with the yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of those kids are green,
some of those kids are yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it with color and with wrinkle
peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it pretty much breaks down to,
for every gene in a genome, there are two
[SPEAKER_00]: copies of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, the genes are dominant,
and in some cases, they're recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's possible for any two copies to
one be dominant and one be recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when you make a cross,
let's say you have a parent that is
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant-dominant with something that is
recessive-recessive, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those progeny are going to be what
we call heterozygous, meaning it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant allele and also has the recessive
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you're dealing with things
that are heterozygous, when you go to make
[SPEAKER_00]: additional crosses, say with something
that's completely recessive or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's completely dominant, you start to
get different ratios of those children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we witnessed was just sort of a
classic example of a gene segregating in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant recessive fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of clarifies things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that brings back some memories
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, things played out the way
you would expect them to from your
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so you took those crosses,
and what did that research show you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that showed us was that,
well, just because the pattern of the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny just gave us, there is a single
dominant R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of confers what we call
vertical resistance to the pathogen that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that's been found
in, it's pretty common in domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that you find this single dominant
resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sort of, Paul looked at the
data and said, okay, we should do some
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing here because we can find a
marker that will associate with this
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant pattern mildew resistant gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, what you're saying is this
gave you the confidence that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually find a particular marker based on
the cross that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that essentially what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you discovered this marker,
which is essentially what the paper is
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the research show you?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you guys use the word resistance,
for example, in the paper, what does that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say visually, and then how do
you, I know you talk about this in the
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, but how do you show that this plant
is indeed resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so to identify powdery mildew on a
crop, it has these white little hairs that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow all over the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of looks like you took a powdered
sugar shaker and just put it all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can identify it once it's
already started to colonize the toast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, visually, we just had this set of
children from our breeding cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every other one had powdery
mildew growing on it or had no powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was none of that powdered sugar on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we took some of that
powdery mildew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We examined it under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of the classic way of
identifying a pathogen is to look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back and reference various
textbooks or resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you identify the spores and you
identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the convium is sort of the scientific
word, but sort of the legs growing off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the spores, which is sort of how the
fungus grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then took a next step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took this isolated powdery mildew at
this point, and we did a quick PCR test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was able to confirm that it was the
specific species of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically all of the plants that
weren't showing any powdery mildew all
[SPEAKER_02]: contained that marker, and the ones that
did have PM did not contain that marker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we went and did a test
called a SNP probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: SNP, FNP, short, sorry, single nucleotide
polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever taken a 23andMe or Ancestry
DNA test, your DNA was run on a SNP chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this does is it identifies
single mutations throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are cannabis-specific SNP chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked with Lighthouse Genomics out
of Canada for this specific project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ran DNA samples from all of
these children, in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, and just looked for mutations
throughout the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we saw with, I think there was
40,000 markers that were run, but on one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the markers we saw, okay, in the
parent, in PNW-39, the resistant parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was this mutation at this specific
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Jumping Jack, the resistant,
I'm sorry, the susceptible parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a different mutation at that
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw that the children split
into three groups, where they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that matched the resistant parent,
the profile that matched the susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, and then things in between that
had, and this goes back to those alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: each copy, where they had one of each of
the mutation at that genetic marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we took that data,
we looked back at sort of our phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: data, what we saw with our eyes,
and we were able to determine that,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is a dominant trait,
meaning that it's either dominant or
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dominant, it's going to show in
the presence of the recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we saw this pattern where some of
the progeny clustered with the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: parent that had the same mutation profile
at that SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw things that had, in the middle,
and then things that went with the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was this a spectrum of resistance that
you saw based on how much of that original
[SPEAKER_02]: PNW marker was there?
[SPEAKER_00]: With this particular population,
we did not see a range of resistance just
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of indicating that this particular
marker infers strong resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say that's going to be
the case for every powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance marker that might be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just PM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our geneticists believe there's probably
five or six in cannabis, and those remain
[SPEAKER_00]: to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with PM1, if you have the correct
mutation in that spot, what we saw is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have full resistance to this strain of
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're saying is there could be,
down the road, other species or strains of
[SPEAKER_02]: PM that could still potentially infect a
plant with this marker, but what you saw
[SPEAKER_02]: in your experiment was essentially full
immunity in your growth chambers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very likely that there are
other powdery mildew strains out there or
[SPEAKER_00]: species that could infect a plant that is
resistant to the powdery mildew species
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of conclusions can we draw?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next logical step in regards to
this research advancement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, for you guys, I would assume
now you're doing breeding projects where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to check for that marker as
you breed more of progeny from this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: line, creating varietals then that I
assume you would then take to market or
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially sell down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the game plan there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how can other growers outside of
your company use this research or
[SPEAKER_02]: companies to further advance our overall
knowledge in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, some of the steps that we've taken,
the next steps we've taken with this
[SPEAKER_00]: project is, of course, we want this in all
of our varieties that we put into our
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial brand that we then sell to
other farmers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, I believe we have just
about a dozen varieties that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced the powdery mildew resistant
into, and those are available for
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other step that we're taking is we
want to find these other PM genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a dream that we would start
PM resistance genes, PM two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, five, if there's that many,
and start to stack these resistance genes
[SPEAKER_00]: into a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you mentioned earlier,
is it possible for a farmer to have one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these varieties and grow them and still
have powdery mildew resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get multiple resistance genes
stacked into a single variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just lowers the chance that powdery
mildew can infect the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where it's grown, no matter what
species of powdery mildew it's subject to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just gets me thinking,
do you have in line to do any research
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding botrytis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's another major one that a lot
of cannabis growers battle, even more so
[SPEAKER_02]: than PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a potential there, I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely not a focus of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, unfortunately, it is definitely,
we are fortunate to be in this situation
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, but for the sake of botrytis,
where we are, we're in Eastern Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis isn't as big of a threat to
cannabis out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit drier than say the Willamette
Valley of Oregon, or anywhere in Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, or even the Emerald Triangle
in California, as they get fall rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That increases the pressure of botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us in Eastern Washington,
it's not as big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other side of that,
we don't want to intentionally bring
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis into our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working with a few folks that
may or may not have botrytis resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with folks on sort of trying to
find this marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of jumping back to your
question on how can other farmers make use
[SPEAKER_00]: of botrytis today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was develop a PCR assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we provide the primers for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, you might need a molecular
biologist on your team to sort of run this
[SPEAKER_00]: assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did provide the framework for
anybody to be testing for this at their
[SPEAKER_00]: facility if they have the right tools and
staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realize there's some limitations with
state boundaries and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were a Washington farmer,
for example, could they send a sample to
[SPEAKER_02]: you to test for that marker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a service that you guys offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a service that we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if there's any interested
listeners out there, we are very happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with folks on ensuring that consumers
are getting a safer product in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you also, and again, this is
something I haven't looked at yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you guys offer actual plants then for
sale that contain that marker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only work within the confines of
Washington State at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are very happy to work with folks
on licensing our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This past growth season, we worked with a
large group in central Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them some of our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We license plant varieties to those who
are interested in farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of just brings me to a
couple more PM questions, if that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One that comes to mind is, have you seen
any research that actually shows any
[SPEAKER_02]: health risks associated with consuming or
combusting cannabis leaf that has some
[SPEAKER_02]: level of powdery mildew on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't able to find anything online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just curious if you had anything on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm unaware of any research that
shows that powdery mildew consumption or
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalation is dangerous to one's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a medical doctor, but I think it's
reasonable to think that it could elicit
[SPEAKER_00]: an immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that could be in the form of
asthma or it could be an allergic reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: to the respiratory tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what's more important here is
that when powdery mildew is on plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: it reduces the vigor of the plant,
ultimately impacting yields and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: case of cannabis, impacting potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not something that farmers want
to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes they will treat their plants
with damaging fungicides and spray that on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my primary concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that poses a huge risk to the health
and safety of cannabis consumers is are
[SPEAKER_00]: they inhaling combusted fungicides and
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really our goal with this is to
just reduce dependence on fungicides that
[SPEAKER_00]: are damaging to human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make clear,
I'm not condoning the use of the sale or
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking or consumption of plants that have
PM on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume that any mold spores in
general are probably things we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep out of our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just curious if you'd actually
found any research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in regards to the fungicides,
it's an unfortunate reality that some
[SPEAKER_02]: people are still using things like Eagle
20, systemic fungicides and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a wonderful point that
you bring up there in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I understand it, any oil based or even
water itself will kill PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't keep it from coming back and
reinfecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've already elicited the stress
response at that point from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assume it's more susceptible even
than it was before you killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something you're going to be
continually fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I think that's that's
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are there are other strategies out
there other than, you know, innate plant
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity to to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it just sort of goes back
to, you know, maybe it is an organic oil
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're spraying on your plants that,
you know, is keeping the powdery mildew at
[SPEAKER_00]: bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I mean, you're still when you're
doing that, you are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterating the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe, you know, say you're
using neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty widely used in the cannabis
industry as a safe pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody reacts well to neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is a mixture of essential oils
and sometimes essential oils can elicit a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative immune response in people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is much, much better than
using something as dangerous as Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's it's not going to remove
your problem and it does adulterate your
[SPEAKER_00]: end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I would just add that,
you know, realistically, we're not we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to spray anything once the
plant starts producing tricum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we get a couple of weeks into
flower, you're pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you are able to spray on a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My preference, I'll just throw this out
here, would probably be something like Suf
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil X or mineral mineral oil based,
even though it's petroleum based.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more research to support
that these products are safer and they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't leave a residue on the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: More so even the neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The less we have to spray, not only is
that a labor savings, it's it's keeping us
[SPEAKER_02]: from having to adulterate the plant at all
or potentially risk anything being on the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf surface come harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people ask me,
is powdery mildew systemic?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's something you
want to address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can kind of share my thoughts,
but I was kind of curious, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you would how you would describe the
life cycle of this of these set of fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry, your question is, is it
systemic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the general life cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's sort of what what a lot
of people are asking regarding this this
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only systemic if the environment
which you're maintaining clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is is sort of inundated with the
powdery mildew spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what what is the life cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's this is a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, fungi fungi have two phases of
their life, they have their their spore
[SPEAKER_00]: producing phase, and they have their sort
of fruiting body production phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, what what how this works is,
you know, spores are introduced to an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll start producing, it sort of
looks like plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these hyphae, as they're called
through whatever that that medium is,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's soil, sometimes it's
something that's particularly carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, like say a rotting apple,
or an apple, it's rotting because the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus is eating all the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it gets to a point where the
hyphae or this, you know, the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to roots is strong enough,
it will start to produce its fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of mushrooms, right,
it's the mushroom that comes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hyphae has this fruiting head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that fruiting head is actually
what then produces the spores for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know, you'll see that sort of
as, as, you know, mushrooms that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gills underneath, right, sort of your
typical cremini or you know, various
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, they'll drop those spores out
of those gills, and then they get spread
[SPEAKER_00]: by the wind or by animals or insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the life cycle continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of cannabis and powdery
mildew, yeah, those spores can can be
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the conditions are ripe,
they can take over a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say it's systemic,
right, if you take a clone, and bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a clean environment, you know,
there's a moderate risk that that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: could then become inundated with powdery
mildew, but only in the right condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, having a clean
facility, especially where you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning is very important in not passing
powdery mildew on from generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just gonna I mean,
you essentially better explain my thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: on it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not systemic, but it can act in ways
that are similar to something that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be systemic in the sense that the spores
are dormant, they may not be visually
[SPEAKER_02]: present to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you are cloning, you can,
while it's not living inside the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue, the fungus itself does penetrate
the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just want to be very careful
when you are cloning, if you are cloning a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that's had PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: To really do a good job of spraying or
treating it prior to cloning, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: even after cloning, just to make sure that
you're not, you know, creating a situation
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're going to have spore pressure
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I really appreciate you taking the
time today to explain this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything else that you wanted to
share regarding this paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we scientific?
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that you guys have going on down
the road?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or future research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, future research,
and I did mention that we're on the press
[SPEAKER_00]: or we're looking for other powdery mildew
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do think we have a couple other in hand
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're awaiting sequencing confirmation to
see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I think my big takeaway here
is, and I didn't even really touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but none of this would have been
possible if it weren't for sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative framework that we had with
organ CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think because of cannabis and
history, people are a little hesitant to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of this would have been possible
without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had the germplasm,
we had some of the key competencies to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting here, and then organ CBD was able
to complement us in ways that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is just a testament to
what's possible when folks in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can achieve great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge proponent of collaboration and
sort of helping other people improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, and hopefully that leads to some
more really cool discoveries like what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found with organ CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, yeah, I really appreciate both
your companies doing this work and
[SPEAKER_02]: furthering, you know, advancing our
knowledge on the subject and then sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: that publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you taking the time today to come on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
