[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My podcast this week is with Virginia
Emery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia is the founder and CEO of Beta
Hatch, a pioneering insect farming company
[SPEAKER_01]: that is industrializing insects for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta Hatch is fueled by a passion to see
insects reach their true potential in our
[SPEAKER_01]: food systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company has grown to be
internationally recognized for its
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific approach to scaling insect
production and operates North America's
[SPEAKER_01]: largest mealworm farm for animal feed
production in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia is the country's most innovative
insect entrepreneur, recently recognized
[SPEAKER_01]: as a visionary grist 50 fixer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia has a PhD in entomology from the
University of California, Berkeley and has
[SPEAKER_01]: been awarded over 20 grants and honors and
has published on subjects ranging from
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical communication to genetics to
insect behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her life's mission is to breed a bug that
tastes like bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some highlights of frass use in relation
to cannabis production are the following.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a clean product ideal for indoor
growing because their insects are grown
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors in climate-controlled conditions
on organic feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no risk of pests, heavy metals,
pesticides, herbicides or fungicides
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a highly soluble source of nitrogen
immediately available to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their studies have shown increased
increases in leafing and fruiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike conventional mineral fertilizer,
frass contains small concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients like copper, zinc and
manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Studies suggest the addition of frass
stimulates soil microbial activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it is mixed with mineral
fertilizer, suggesting a synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect between both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taken together, results indicate that
frass has a great potential to be used as
[SPEAKER_01]: a partial or complete substitute for
mineral NPK fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their frass is produced locally in
Washington state in a zero waste system
[SPEAKER_01]: and is OMRI and USDA certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm excited to learn more about
insect frass and insect rearing and
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we start off, though, by telling
listeners a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_01]: background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am an entomologist by training,
so I'm a bug expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me the bug lady in Seattle,
where I've been sharing my business for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My company is Beta Hatch and we farm
insects as a sustainable protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the great co-products of our
process is frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frass is the word of the day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the technical term for insect poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a saying at Beta Hatch that
frass happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company has been a couple of years
under development since I started working
[SPEAKER_00]: on this in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been operating commercially for
about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got started with the business because as
an entomologist, about 99% of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: work on is how to kill bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have this very antagonistic
relationship with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really leaving a lot on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, bugs do incredible things as far
as ecosystem services for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's very familiar with
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But organic waste recycling and nutrition
is an area that we see a lot of missed
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what Beta Hatch has been
working on, is just making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: insects can be part of that circular and
regenerative food system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you started Beta Hatch,
is there a reason that you chose mealworms
[SPEAKER_01]: as your main, I guess, insect source of
frass or for breaking down material versus
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the other options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there like black soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I guess there's the technical
reasons that I could quote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our bugs are dry adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of genome diversity,
which is useful for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can eat all kinds of feedstocks,
break down mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of things like that I
could quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sort of the initial start,
which was probably more fun for your
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners, is that I started off growing
bugs in a little shed at my house in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ballard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the Ballard Bug Barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically a little climate
controlled shed that I grew a couple dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: species of bugs in while I was
experimenting at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big things that was a first
sign that the mealworm was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good species to work with happened over
the summer when I went away and had
[SPEAKER_00]: neglected some of my insect colonies
because I had been out on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back, most of the bugs
were in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the case of some flies had
literally flown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mealworms were just happy and
contented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few months later, I found a box that
I had neglected for even longer and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stuffed away sort of back on a
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were also doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really hardy insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the first, you know,
I guess indications that the mealworm was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a really great insect that
could handle all kinds of the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've run into as we were to scale up
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just really hardy bugs that can,
you know, basically withstand very cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hot temperatures, all kinds of
humidity levels and can eat almost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really nice insect to work with
from a, you know, if you're a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: producer just looking to get started
producing bugs, one of the easiest ones to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with, but then also from an
industrial standpoint where we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with beta hatch, they're super amenable to
automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of reasons that it's
actually a lot cheaper to produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, I'd encourage anyone
who's interested in trying out raising
[SPEAKER_00]: some bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mealworms are a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to hear from you about
what or I guess how a home user may be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to start incorporating mealworms into
their, you know, their goals for
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability with composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do, can you talk a little
bit when you said that mealworms are
[SPEAKER_01]: really good eating a wide variety of food
sources, what sorts of things do you feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your mealworms and what are they best
known for in terms of consuming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're pretty focused on ensuring
that what we're doing is as sustainable as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been looking at industrial
coproducts and byproducts, mostly from
[SPEAKER_00]: food processing at our facility in
Cashmere, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually one of the ingredients we
use is a apple byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the Wenatchee Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the apple capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an apple processor just down
the road from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably less than a mile to go and
get that feedstock, which is incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: short supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can eat actually a huge range of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at over a hundred different
ingredients and there's nothing we found
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can't eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually even eat plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we've been from an
industrial and the sort of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective focused on feedstocks that
make sense for us economically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also from a sustainability standpoint,
trying to make sure that as we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at inputs, we're trying to find the ones
that have both the lowest cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the lowest environmental
footprints and making sure we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: diverting food from other sources,
such as other animal feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mealworms are stored grain pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been living for millennia with
us in our stored grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the common things people
think about are oats and wheats and those
[SPEAKER_00]: grains that you might have found a stray
insect in before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we've done a really good job
of eliminating them as a stored grain
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's sort of their history of how
they've evolved for eating, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been these scavengers in many
ways, they have incredible digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like little bioreactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gut microbes and all the things
living in their guts allow them to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, even plastic, the only
known way to biodegrade polystyrene or
[SPEAKER_00]: styrofoam is in the gut of a mealworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty incredible set of things
that they can be eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is there any risk of pests or
pathogens with mealworm production or
[SPEAKER_01]: rearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very much farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a typical sense, we've got a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worry about, you know, the pests and
disease that can impact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get sick just like anything else,
viruses and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in our case, pest control
of just making sure that we don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: other insects coming in is a big concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've basically made paradise for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be really careful about
ensuring we don't have any pests
[SPEAKER_00]: established in our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also very different than a lot of
traditional farming because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We control every aspect of production from
the inputs, you know, the growing process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the sort of manufacturing pieces
that just allow us to separate out the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more like a factory kind of
setting, almost like a clean room setting
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is a farm with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an interesting place to,
you know, we kind of straddle that divide
[SPEAKER_00]: between being a farmer and being a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the beauty of that indoor production
is that because we have total control over
[SPEAKER_00]: the process and the inputs, there's very
minimal risk in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means both from a pathogen
standpoint, the microbial components,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, you know, there's no,
you know, residues of soils or risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like heavy metals in the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across the board, because we have such
a great control over how we're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: these mealworms, we can actually ensure a
much safer product for both our feed
[SPEAKER_00]: products, where the mealworms themselves
are being used as feed, we can ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been no bioaccumulation of any
kind of toxins, we can make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, everything we're doing is
organically produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we source organic ingredients for
our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything is certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the fertilizer side,
the frass side of the equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can also ensure there's no pests or
pathogens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically a micro manure where
you're not going to have any kind of risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of any kind of insects or other microbial
issues that might be of concern to anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's using the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I probably we probably should back
up and talk about what the end products
[SPEAKER_01]: are from your mealworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also what the life cycle of a
mealworm is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, there's so much to talk about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mealworms, I'll start with the life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mealworm, as it's commonly known,
is not a worm at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an insect and the adult is a beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, similar to how a
butterfly will go through this
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation of being a caterpillar to a
cocoon or a pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pupal stage into the adult,
which is a butterfly that lays an egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a beetle that lays eggs,
those hatch into the larva, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: the mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main product we harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a subset of our system,
we are breeding these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we allow them to go through
pupation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of look like little aliens in
the pupal stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those guys will turn into adults
and the cycle continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that whole process can take as long
as a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as short as a few weeks, depending on
how we handle them and treat them and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're looking at around two
months from egg to product in our case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as we're growing them,
the main product is the mealworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larva themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we harvest those mealworms as a
nutritious, high-protein, high-fat feed
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient for animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really focused right now on backyard
birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who's got a flock at home,
this is a fantastic way to give a big
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional boost to your birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certified organic, made right here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the larva are the feed ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for poultry, but also great
for fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increasingly, we're exploring a lot of
options in pet food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even cats and dogs love mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the bug piece of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, as they're growing,
they're producing frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as any other animal that's
growing, they'll produce some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: manure type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of, you know, we call it waste,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this vocabulary around waste,
which in my opinion, I think is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually be eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we think of is waste now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasingly finding uses for all of
our wastes because we see anywhere there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that's coming out of some sort
of system, and there's an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's also where Betahatch has
been really looking at the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say, hey, where can we find a
waste byproduct and take that,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it to our insects, and create
something of real value?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those products are the mealworms as
a feed and the frass as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, you know, having been a
former feed store owner up until last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, we sold a ton of dried mealworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, and, you know, we call it
chicken crack is what a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard chicken owners call it because
chickens will go crazy for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very high in protein, which is good for
egg production as a supplement to their
[SPEAKER_01]: diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I didn't realize was a lot of the
ones that we were ordering in our supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain were coming out of China,
which potentially from what I was reading,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not an expert on this,
but there's a lot more risks of toxins,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals from the production methods
that are being used over there because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot less oversight versus say
something here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's pretty unknown,
but every single dried mealworm that's on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market today, except for the products
with our customer, Chubby Mealworm,
[SPEAKER_00]: is from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the dried mealworms that you
see, even if they say they might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged in the US, they were grown in
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the only domestic producer of
mealworms for backyard birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have been really trying to try
to bring awareness to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that, you know, this treat that a
lot of backyard bird owners are super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to give to their flock because
yeah, it is chicken crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's coming from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some responsible producers
for sure, but there's also just a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually have been in China and
visited some of these operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's just a kind of different
approach and standard to production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to give you a case in point,
even the interpretation of the rules can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little, I guess, lost in translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we visited a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, oh, yeah, we're only giving
pre-consumer grocery waste to our insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as I'm touring the
operation, it was pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like they were just eating
garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bits of glass and plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept reassuring me like,
no, no, it's all pre-consumer grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: waste, which is what they're rules are for
responsible production, according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that was lost in translation
here is they weren't actually de-packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that grocery waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were just grinding up,
you know, plastic containers and glass
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles with whatever that organic
material was and giving that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the insects are actively
digesting, eating plastic, that's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what other kinds of,
you know, contaminants or things could be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's definitely some concerns
with, you know, relying on that foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain for something that people are
putting in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we're super excited to
get to market with our American grown
[SPEAKER_00]: mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're organically produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we're giving our insects
is certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have insured from the inputs to the
end products that we're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is food grade, certified
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grown right here in Washington state
from waste ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only domestically produced,
but complete transparency and trust of
[SPEAKER_00]: just knowledge of what's going into our
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we think is
really important for anyone who's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: birds that, you know, if you're going to
harvest eggs and, you know, enjoy having
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard birds, you want them to be as
healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we've seen such great
opportunities with our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually can't grow fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great problem to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons we're scaling up
our production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize you were the only
domestic producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I met you, oh,
probably five, four or five years ago now
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Flower and Garden Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were still kind of, you know,
getting production established and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad we were able to circle back on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you touched on just now was how
the feedstock will affect the final
[SPEAKER_01]: product, whether it's the mealworm itself
or it's frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more information about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, has there been any research done or
have you seen that NPK values,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, will vary based on what you
feed the mealworms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, you know, this is one of those
challenges with marketing any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have sort of a guaranteed minimum on
your label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we often are exceeding
those numbers as far as our NPKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We guarantee a 232, but we've measured
close to 555 with some feedstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, what you put in really changes
what you get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get a firm number set for
our new facility so that we can hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust some of those numbers accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But effectively, yeah, what you're feeding
the insects is going to change the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that does not change,
though, about the frass, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the NPK value looks like,
is that it's a product rich in chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of benefits to sort
of the non, those macronutrients that get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of attention, but there's
micronutrients and other components that
[SPEAKER_00]: can have these other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of known benefits on
controlling nematodes because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: activate chitin feeding microbes in the
soil when you are providing a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: chitin as you get in frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then that can help lead to
biocontrol of things like nematodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other pests that can affect
different types of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, magnesium is another nutrient that
we certify in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the frass has at least a half
percentage of magnesium, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the fruiting of tomatoes and
other nightshades and plenty of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not just the NPK, but a lot of
other I guess interesting interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: between frass and the soil when you use it
as a fertilizer and as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one question I had, do you know
anything about the microbial content of
[SPEAKER_01]: the final frass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys looked at that at all from a
biological perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've started to dig in there a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a microbiologist on staff
and so she's been really digging into just
[SPEAKER_00]: all the microbial interactions with their
bugs and in the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that we certify each batch,
making sure that there's no pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli that are going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know there is a rich community
of microbes there and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn as much as we can about how that
impacts the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some testing with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly know that as a stimulator for
compost, frass can really help enrich and
[SPEAKER_00]: feed a compost that's to get it started
and producing a healthy microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: consortia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I'm sure you know, with microbes,
it's just this small world we're barely
[SPEAKER_00]: scratching the surface of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just starting to learn the
importance and value of microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're part of that revolution of
trying to really think about fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil amendments and soil in a more,
I guess, community focused way,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're looking at the community of
microbes and trying to think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is an area we're really
excited in the next growing season to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more field tests on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always looking for testing
partners to help get some independent
[SPEAKER_00]: third party testing of the products then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the questions that I wanted to
go back to was also how do people,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they want to say rear mealworms
themselves, how would you go about doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any recommendations for, I don't know,
websites or books or even just a quick how
[SPEAKER_01]: to right now or the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's tons of great
resources online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen lots of really interesting
YouTube channels, people getting really
[SPEAKER_00]: elaborate in their home setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mealworms are really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow them in a shoe box,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I wouldn't recommend a cardboard
shoe box because they can eat through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the two resources I would point people
to, one is a group, Katerina Ungers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a great entrepreneur who's done a lot of
work on insects, more of the food focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But absolutely, there's an opportunity for
those insects to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been really interested in helping
people get in their diet directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just you're not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting it into your bird's diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so her company OnFarm has actually a
little desktop version.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the Hive, which is a little
ready made kit for growing mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great place for people to get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a project called Open Bug
Farm that the current folks that were
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that project have moved on to
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that's still an active
resource with a lot of online different
[SPEAKER_00]: forums with questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had an active community of people
who were, you know, on this sort of small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, looking to grow bugs, contributing
their know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another resource that I
would recommend people check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Internet is full of great and
wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly the wealth of knowledge
around farming bugs at home has really
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd recommend YouTube's got plenty of
interesting, great explainers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, like an average,
you know, residential family for could
[SPEAKER_01]: create a small little mealworm setup and
recycle some of their waste into
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially more useful product,
I guess, for their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, you know, one of the
challenges and this is true of any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: home compost kind of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, any setup you're trying to
do to recycle your waste is a question of
[SPEAKER_00]: volume and just sort of time and ability
to, you know, take care of whatever it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that's helping you break down any kind of
organic waste you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say mealworms are they
can eat almost anything, but they still
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be fed in a particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need they need care on a fairly
frequent basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so absolutely would encourage anyone
who's interested in trying this out to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also just buy our mealworms if
it's something that you're finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: little intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as, you know, thinking about how to
get a little home setup going,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually suggest, you know,
if you're looking composting is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to I think be looking at recycling
some of your organic waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some interesting there's
some interesting stuff going on with black
[SPEAKER_00]: soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which handles a much more wet waste,
which is typically what most people's
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen waste is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another, you know, the black
soldier fly is a type of fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they produce a larva that, as I said,
lives more of this kind of wet feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is, of course, that they're
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, getting a reliable
breeding system going for black soldier
[SPEAKER_00]: fly on a home basis can be a little
challenging, especially in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's plenty of different suppliers
that you can buy animals from,
[SPEAKER_00]: both the black soldier fly or mealworm or
any other type of bug that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty active live market that's
actually seen a lot of growth through the
[SPEAKER_00]: last year because there's been this huge
surge in interest in backyard birds and
[SPEAKER_00]: homesteading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited to see that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it continues into 2021 and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to tour a facility up in
Vancouver that grows black soldier fly and
[SPEAKER_01]: produces an insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, when I first started
looking into this, I didn't realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: black soldier fly adults, when they're in
the fly form, they don't eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't transmit the same diseases
that your traditional house fly gets
[SPEAKER_01]: attributed to, which is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually I tried raising black
soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought one of those protopod larva
things, and I had no luck getting any
[SPEAKER_01]: naturalization here in the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently some people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried for a couple of seasons and
finally gave up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know some people in certain areas
are like, oh, black soldier flies are
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They contaminate my compost pile is how
some people look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they are pretty amazing
creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to mention, so we do,
you know, through through Kiss Organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do have a black soldier fly frass that
we offer, as well as we're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: offering your the beta hatch mealworm
product as well, which I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about, too, after looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's interesting because the the
word frass is just, you know, it's a term
[SPEAKER_00]: for bug poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, slightly different process
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mealworm frass is actually pure
frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sift it out in a way that we're
basically getting little tiny tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: granules of bug poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: People used to ask, like, how do you
collect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we just have lots of tiny little
doggie bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it looks kind of like sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't really seeing what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of just imagine, you know,
probably people are imagining,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when they've looked at their
compost pile and what that looks like with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of maggots in there and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very clean operation inside and
controlled the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so that everyone, again,
can sort of imagine what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mealworms, you know, it just looks
like a little about an inch long,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little larva, very kind of like a little
half half, you know, crescent moon,
[SPEAKER_00]: inch long, little dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like a snack,
like a text mix sort of ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the frass, the frass,
the mealworm frass is basically like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really easy to apply because it's
that pure frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really good and consistent
nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black soldier fly frass, you know,
sometimes has a mix of other inputs in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because the diet is harder to separate
from the frass, but it's also a great
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient for any kind of soil amendment
or fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, I would definitely hope
that your listeners are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it out in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely a larger,
larger sized and more varied amendment in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the way it looks compared to the
insect frass that we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_01]: the mealworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your product is much finer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very obvious when you look at them
side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have slightly different NPK
levels as well, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume a different consortia of
microbes when we.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say I haven't seen any work
on it yet comparing these two kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two products, but there's some really
interesting work coming out of Europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of Asia as well, where there's been
a lot of good independent science and data
[SPEAKER_00]: on frass, both mealworm frass and black
soldier fly frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you're asking about the microbes
is kind of like all the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see that are in there having these
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they've been finding some
really interesting, compelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, value to frass that's beyond just
the NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the studies was published
actually in Nature as part of their group
[SPEAKER_00]: of journals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at mealworm frass and
found when you take a control group where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just, you know, exactly the same NPK
profile and you take the frass group,
[SPEAKER_00]: the frass group outperforms the NPK group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we look at a nutritionally
equivalent control that's not derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in that sort of
inexplicable something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely that question of,
is this a microbe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the chitin?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening that's, you know,
basically creating this bio-stimulant
[SPEAKER_00]: effect in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that mechanistically
is still being looked into, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's pretty clear from all the
growth trials that there's something there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's causing better plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that in our tests too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a bunch of field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites, I grew a bunch of
jalapenos at my house this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have way more than I know what to do
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you have any good salsa
recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm flushed with jalapenos now because of
this growth test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the surprising results is that
we actually got twice as many fruits that
[SPEAKER_00]: were twice as large with our frass
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran, you know, a negative control
and also positive control against a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: other just commercial products that are
and did a, you know, made sure everything
[SPEAKER_00]: was nutrient similar as far as NPK goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got this extra fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of, again, hard to
pinpoint why, but we know that that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: real effect that we're seeing with the use
of frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting
point when we talk about the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I'd like to touch on is that
you mentioned at the end is that you do
[SPEAKER_01]: need to take into account the NPK value
when, you know, formulating or adding it
[SPEAKER_01]: into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But assuming you're doing that,
I think you guys are recommending around a
[SPEAKER_01]: cup per cubic foot is a safe rate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, as far as yeah, as far as
the safe rate, because it's got this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pretty mellow nutrient
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a fertilizer that's going to
burn your your plants or cause any issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with over application in the same way that
you would see with, say, like a synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, typically about a cup per cubic
foot is a great application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even a teaspoon or a tablespoon in a
cubic foot can have an impact based on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the work that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, again, that that intangible,
I mean, oh, man, I'd love to do a follow
[SPEAKER_00]: up next year after we've done a little
more research and and started to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the microbial component,
because, yeah, there's a lot to look into
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of the tests where I'm going to
be doing this coming fall is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at frass in Martian soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really interested in the
application of what we do to space travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about closed loop and enclosed
food production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've ordered some simulated
Martian soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's developed by the Jet Propulsion Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be using our frass to
fertilize it and get a sense of how it
[SPEAKER_00]: performs as a basically as a source of
nutrition in an otherwise sterile kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should have some updates on that
trial in a couple of months for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I look forward to hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that from working with some
researchers in a lab up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: they looked at black soldier fly frass and
found in this particular producer good
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of calcium solubilizing and
phosphorus solubilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there is a lot to be said for
the, you know, the the microbes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being excreted or the gut microbes from
these insects as as like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of intangible benefit that we're
still I don't know that we'll ever learn
[SPEAKER_01]: all the mechanisms of soil science or
insects for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there is something to it
beyond just the NPK values of of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product itself, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're definitely really interested in
nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we know like basically we've done
some genomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know each of these players are there
and present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that question of how abundant
are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing with the frass in the
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kind of questions we're
trying to dig into a bit more and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out if we can boost those
beneficial microbes a little bit more in
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, lots to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a really exciting time to be
involved in insect agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people are using it with their
plants, are they just you said teaspoon,
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoon or even a cup per cubic foot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they mixing it in prior to planting or
are people using it as a top dress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any like best practices that
you've seen with this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I definitely recommend if you can
blend it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work as a top dress as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a fraction of the nutrients,
of course, that are soluble and will sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see, of course, some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't dissolve completely,
so it'll stay on the surface as you water
[SPEAKER_00]: it in over a few, a few days or a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nutrition from the frass is still
getting into the soil, even with a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fairly flexible product in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've done trials even at larger
scale with traditional field farm
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for dispensing fertilizer,
and that's a top dress application and
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten really good results that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know both blending and mixing if you
can at the beginning of the season is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to make sure that those nutrients
are near the roots where you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a top dress also just sort of as a
midseason addition is also a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: use frass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also say we've used it
indoors fairly often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have really any kind of odor,
and you can be using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it on my indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of broad ranges of
applications for the frass that we
[SPEAKER_00]: produce, and we're really excited to be
able to start making more in the next year
[SPEAKER_00]: as our new big bug factory gets opened up
in Cashmere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next season's going to be lots of frass
out there, hopefully growing lots of great
[SPEAKER_00]: food for people here in Washington and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to next season as well for a
variety of reasons with everything going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the world these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year will definitely be a better
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I wanted to ask you,
do you see with these top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, due to the biology in the
frass, are you seeing like mycelial growth
[SPEAKER_01]: or mold over time growing from the frass?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've never seen that in the tests
that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's a possible effect because
you just never know what's in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that might get activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the frass itself, there's never
been any growth like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not typically been something
that we've noticed in any of the trials
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the microbiology that you're seeing in
the frass, is it strictly bacteria or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe archaea in the frass?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fungal microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, I wish microbiologist Ola was
able to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's done a lot of work on everything
from what's inside the mealworms to then,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, what ends up outside in the
frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we've seen all kinds of fungal
microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spans the whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what you might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have at this time any
particular treatment for the frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to maintain as much of that
natural microbiota as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not doing any kind of heat
treatment or sterilization because we do
[SPEAKER_00]: know that there's some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it's something we can do for a
customer if they're concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we see a lot of value in maintaining
that natural, good microbial consortia
[SPEAKER_00]: that is valuable for soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think one of the main,
the biggest benefit is probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to hear that it is microbially
active and you're not sterilizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think that the chitin
component as well is something that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: very interested in continuing to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not necessarily, it's not
something live in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it nourishes naturally existent
microbes in the soil to help defend
[SPEAKER_00]: against some of these pathogens that can
impact different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another area that we're
going to be working on doing some future
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have ways in our process of kind of
increasing how much chitin content there
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that as an interesting
opportunity down the road as we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more and more about the products
that we have, which we know are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just finding ways to make them even better
is something that I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, now I think that was most of my
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you'd like to share
regarding your company or mealworm frass
[SPEAKER_01]: or mealworm production before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would just remind everyone they
can always check out our website,
[SPEAKER_00]: datahatch.com, if they have a query or
want to find out more about getting some
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, Chubby Mealworms is our key
customer on the mealworm side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're carrying our American-grown
mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the best place if you want to
buy some mealworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also be carrying frass in the next
few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a great place to buy our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're very excited for next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a facility we're building over
in the Wenatchee area that should come
[SPEAKER_00]: online early next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully by next summer, we'll be
producing close to a ton a day of
[SPEAKER_00]: mealworms and several tons a day of frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there'll be a lot more of that
product available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to be getting this
out to folks to be growing some great food
[SPEAKER_00]: next year and getting their gardens and
their compost piles started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've received some of the frass in
as well for our inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to getting it out to
some of our customers and listeners as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a really exciting
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love what you guys are doing from a
sustainability perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that we were able to connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Virginia Emery with Betahatch,
and you are listening to the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now offering Betahatch frass on our
website if you want to try it out in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
