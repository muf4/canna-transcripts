[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Tab with Kiss Organics and I'm
here with my wife Robin and my daughter
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we started Kiss over a
decade ago with the idea of offering
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller amounts of amendments and soils
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know if we were gonna make it
and we've had a lot of ups and downs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm grateful to say that we're here
today and really appreciate all your
[SPEAKER_01]: support over all the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, throughout all of this,
some of the things that have been really
[SPEAKER_01]: important to us are to give back to the
community and to help the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we started Rose,
which was a trail, a nonprofit associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with teaching children about native
ecology in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked with EnviroStars and we've
donated in the past to HopeLink and last
[SPEAKER_01]: year we donated to the Flint Unity
Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year, we've been thinking a lot
about this and want to do something a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would like to do is to help
five families or individuals with products
[SPEAKER_00]: and services from Kiss that we can help
you either grow your own medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own food, but really just in the
spirit of giving back to those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community who are really in need right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you or anyone you know could benefit
from this, please don't hesitate to reach
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a link on the profile page as
well as on kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very basic submission and all
entries will be anonymous and we hope to
[SPEAKER_01]: help some families out in this upcoming
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again for all your support and
we wish everyone a happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
