[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of KISS
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bryant is a certified crop advisor who
specializes in organic cannabis nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has spent the last four years working
to combine precision laboratory techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: with data science in an effort to unravel
the complexities of cannabis soil and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with his work on soilless media,
he also helps outdoor cultivators around
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States with nutrient management
and cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to do soil testing,
help with interpreting a soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are interested in an online course on
these subjects, his website is www
[SPEAKER_00]: .soiledoctorconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Bryant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been on the show multiple
times here, and listeners are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with who you are and what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just go ahead and dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had talked before the show about one of
my recent podcasts with Paul Coxon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Veazey talking about phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a topic that kind of sparked
some interest in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to share some of your feedback
or some of your thoughts from that
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off, I just want to say that
whenever I see any research related to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis nutrient management, I'm thrilled
because it's just so many decades behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many questions and so few
answers scientifically, at least in the
[SPEAKER_01]: research literature that I just love
seeing that kind of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did listen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my dominant takeaway is,
and I'm sure you show this, is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of disappointment in the fact that all
the nutrient research in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production that I've seen is non-organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that changes things so dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The target nutrient levels that those
researchers were talking about were so
[SPEAKER_01]: much higher than anything that I ever see
in organic living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was tough for me to use their target
numbers to ascertain any information about
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're seeing in organic soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the research that I've been
reading is mostly in hydro solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense from a research standpoint
because they're able to control more
[SPEAKER_01]: variables using soilless media and ionic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a little tough to pull numbers
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were applying hundreds of PPM of
soluble phosphorus in one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting thing I remember
hearing was that they weren't seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative yield from huge whopping amounts
of phosphorus, which I've sort of observed
[SPEAKER_01]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend super high phosphorus
levels, but I haven't seen really elevated
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or tissue phosphorus levels create
any zinc, iron, or manganese deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not very clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that did add up to what I've seen
working with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you look on Mulder's chart,
for example, which shows sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonisms and such associated with
various nutrients, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus does have an antagonistic
relationship, I believe, with iron and
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc, I think, and a couple other
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet I've heard you talk about how it's
it's sort of a luxury nutrient in that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not seeing those sorts of issues
with high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of expand on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, Mulder's chart has always
been a source of fascination for me
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've always wondered how it was
developed, what crops they were using,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are certain antagonisms that
show up very quickly and very aggressively
[SPEAKER_01]: in different crops and not in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for whatever reason, cannabis doesn't
seem to exhibit these types of antagonisms
[SPEAKER_01]: as quickly and as easily as something like
maybe a corn or soybean crop would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that probably explains the
difference with the Mulder's chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on how it was created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, and I've seen this in other crop
types, I've seen zinc deficiencies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are from excess phosphorus application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I just haven't
necessarily seen that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are other reactions,
too, that may happen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with calcium, calcium phosphate is a
classic insoluble precipitate that can
[SPEAKER_01]: happen with really elevated levels of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in organic systems, most of that
phosphorus that we're applying is either
[SPEAKER_01]: through compost, soft rock phosphate,
or bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not in these highly soluble forms
that are going to precipitate out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil as easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why on a standard soil test,
you might see a pretty large amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate, but you're not going to see as
much in the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I see very elevated soluble
phosphorus numbers is when people are
[SPEAKER_01]: using phosphoric acid to usually to pH
down their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I just want to add on that,
if they're using fish hydrolysate or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's stabilized with
phosphoric acid, I've also seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last time I've seen it is in
soil mixes that have a lot of bat guano,
[SPEAKER_00]: high phosphorus bat guano, which you and I
were talking about prior to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can see in organics what's
causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me always really stands out
when you have a really high available
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus number on your saturated paste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that note, I consistently have
growers with quite low available P,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 0.5, for example, on the saturated
paste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we're not seeing P deficiencies
necessarily in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yields seem to be quite good still.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a fascinating one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always found that phosphorus is one
of the least accurate nutrients to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: based on soil test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps to have the standard test and the
paste test in the case of phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put a little bit more weight on
the standard test when it comes to looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at phosphorus because of phosphorus
dynamics are very biologically driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general theory that I work off of
is if you can have a large enough
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir of phosphorus in your soil,
microorganisms are mineralizing phosphate
[SPEAKER_01]: and delivering them to the plant root
pretty efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very rare in natural
ecosystems and in agro ecosystems for
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble phosphorus levels to accumulate to
very high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other issue is in a new soil,
it's been sitting in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that phosphorus is mineralized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might see three or four parts
per million on the paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you water it and as soon as
those plants start growing, it usually
[SPEAKER_01]: drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without supplemental feeds,
yeah, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 is usually what you
[SPEAKER_01]: see on the paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen very little correlation to
what ultimately matters, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as levels are sufficient on
the tissue test, that's all I care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, I have a range of phosphorus on
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as it's in that range,
and ideally on the high end of that range,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no concerns whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that there is a correlation
between sufficient tissue levels and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's seen on that standard test in
pounds per acre of phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like to slowly build
phosphorus levels in soil until that
[SPEAKER_01]: number is sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my next podcast that I'm actually
recording later this week is with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kerry Peters over at Jack's Fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the chemist over there talking about
tissue testing specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll definitely dive into that more
for listeners here really soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk to you about the
phosphorus number on the standard test,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the maleic-3 test.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that tied, or is it tied to the
exchange capacity of the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to kind of dive into CEC,
TCC, and sort of what those challenges are
[SPEAKER_00]: with what we're calling living soils,
soilless media versus actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most phosphorus in a peat-based media
is not on any soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any exchange sites, a lot of it's tied up
in compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as microbes slowly decompose that
compost, it's released.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also tied up in rock phosphate
minerals and different animal-based meals,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, fish bone meal or just
standard bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually agronomically, the traditional
CEC definition is more focused on the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil's ability to hold cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phosphate is actually a negatively
charged anion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not usually very related to the
CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CEC, cation exchange capacity,
is the interesting thing about CEC on a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test, especially on peat-based media,
is it's actually a calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a direct measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that is usually if a
soil test comes back, they're directly
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring how much calcium and sodium and
nitrogen and zinc are in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using a machine called an ICP,
and they're directly measuring the parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million of that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with TEC or CEC, they're sort of
synonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a calculation that's adding
calcium, magnesium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sodium together, the cationic
macronutrients, and making some small
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments for other bases and hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a calculation that's summing all
of those cations extracted in the maleic-3
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the maleic-3 has a pH of 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dissolving those into solution,
and the lab just adds them all up based on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the numbers of nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that this is a problem is
because usually in traditional agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: calculations, you apply more nutrients to
a higher CEC soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a peat-based media, you're gonna see
higher CEC when you have more cationic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you will apply more nutrients,
and you keep applying more and more,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden you've over-applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of a positive feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I look at the CEC measurement is
more of a, almost like an EC measurement,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just for the cations, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually, CEC was developed for
mineral topsoils, and especially acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: topsoils without any excess mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these cations are essentially binding
to clay particles, the negatively charged
[SPEAKER_01]: sites on clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you add all of those together,
it gives you a pretty good sense of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those sites in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soil-less media, or in peat-based
media, that's not really how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those cations exist in compost or
minerals, or just floating around in the
[SPEAKER_01]: media matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I have some questions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anecdotally, when I see a high exchange
capacity, I'll see higher levels of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cations, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also tend to see higher phosphate
and sulfur levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just because, on average,
when growers are, when we're seeing those
[SPEAKER_00]: high cation levels, it's just growers are
probably over-applying P and S too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not actually tied in any way
mathematically to that calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when you apply to get high
calcium, or to get high magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: or potassium, they're usually applied in
the form of, you know, gypsum,
[SPEAKER_01]: or potassium sulfate, or even just
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings in all the nutrients in a
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nutrient levels tend to be correlated,
because in organic production,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're sort of applying them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's just gypsum, it's still
calcium and sulfur together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see both of those levels climb
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The math is not connected.
Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the way I've always thought of
CEC is like a giant sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like what's the soil, like when we're
talking about actual soil here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sand, silt, clay's ability to retain
nutrients, cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the higher the CEC, the more clay
in there, the more nutrients it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take for that soil to be saturated and
have a lot of like plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's pros and cons to high C soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low C soil, let's say like sandy soils in
Florida, for example, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly applying low levels of
nutrients because it doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to retain those nutrients for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if your CEC in actual soil is
quite high, you may have to apply a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients just to move the needle a little
bit and maintain fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an okay way of describing anything
you would change or tweak in that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: layman's definition?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty good way to think
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sponge is a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also often seen like a dinner plate,
you know, and you can like only hold so
[SPEAKER_01]: many ions on that dinner plate and the
dinner plate is representing a clay
[SPEAKER_01]: colloid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Brandon or someone who works for
you in an email to me referred to them as
[SPEAKER_01]: docking sites, which I really liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so many docking sites on a
clay mineral and these cations can attach
[SPEAKER_01]: and once all the docking sites are full,
there's nowhere for these ions to attach
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they'll leach out of the soil over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why agronomically, you really
assume that there's no excess ions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that aren't cations that aren't
attached to a docking site because they've
[SPEAKER_01]: all leached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you extract all the cations and
add them up, then you have a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate of how many docking sites there
are in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that was a good explanation
and I think it's just a tough thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply to peat-based media because those
docking sites don't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matrix of peat, compost,
cobalt core, aggregate minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they're not actually exchanging in
the traditional sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just a measure of your
fertility in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually telling you what this,
there's no real CEC there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I don't quite understand
then is if the way the lab measures it is
[SPEAKER_00]: by measuring, by adding up all these
cations essentially, to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: number, how do they determine an actual
soil what a CEC is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a soil may have a high CEC,
but have very little cations in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, at a given point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They extract all of the cationic nutrients
and then add them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they adjust for atomic weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They divide by other bases and
exchangeable hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're accounting for a few other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is they add it all up and
they estimate the CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you incorporate all of the
cations that we mentioned, the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cations, and hydrogen, a soil with a high
CEC with low nutrient levels will be
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because all of those exchange sites
will be occupied by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not occupied by calcium,
magnesium, potassium, or sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that soil will be acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a high CEC soil without a lot of
nutrients, you're going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something is going to occupy those
exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the soils that we work with are
pretty close to neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see that as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that really quickly
because there is that exchangeable
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen that people will see on the
standard test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only shows up when you have,
obviously, acidic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that number really tell us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've asked Logan to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a source of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 100% correlated to pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be zero with pHs above 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll tick up with pHs below 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really just a different way to
look at pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no useful value to the percent
exchangeable hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to organic matter and how
that relates to a soilless media versus
[SPEAKER_00]: actual soil and what targets should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organic matter does involve a direct
measurement, unlike CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the measurement is taken from a
technique called loss on ignition,
[SPEAKER_01]: which estimates organic matter based on
the weight change of the soil after they
[SPEAKER_01]: heat it up to a really high temperature,
I believe 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost as hot as combustion flame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that temperature, there's a lot of
oxidation of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they weigh the sample before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weigh it after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, they're weighing how much
carbon is lost at 800 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: In top soil, that carbon is primarily
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe organic matter is 58% carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an inexpensive and it's an
accurate enough technique to be widely
[SPEAKER_01]: used in soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really the best method at scale for
testing organic matter in soil or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: estimating organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in actual media, in actual soil and
mineral based soil, if you go out in your
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard or whatever, in peat based media,
there's two problems here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that the carbon that is
oxidized is in a peat based media is not
[SPEAKER_01]: real organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's primarily peat moss or cocoa core or
immature compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things aren't technically organic
matter in the same sense that it is in a
[SPEAKER_01]: real mineral topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're carbon based, so they show up as
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just behave differently is
essentially what you're getting at,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being decarbonized, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it depends on how you define
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most soil scientists would
characterize organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least what we're trying to get at with
organic matter is a long chain carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: compound that has taken a long time to
form and is fairly recalcitrant,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning it's doesn't decompose very easily
or very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it provides nutrients and a very sort
of diverse microbial habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by that definition, peat moss
doesn't really fit because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a totally different carbon
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of an antiquated word,
but humus is this substance, this magical
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of jet fuel in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally different than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic in nature in the sense that
it's made out of carbon, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: give us all the plant health and agronomic
benefits that true long chain organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter does in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't give us all the benefits when
it turns over and when it changes form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a totally different species
of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the organic matter on a
peat based media, it's really just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: showing us the weight loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets to the second issue,
which is the measurements highly
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated to bulk density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if your soil is super fluffy right
out of the bag, it's going to show a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we all know that bulk density
changes over time, that's why if you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in a pot, it looks like the soil sinks two
to four inches in the first round.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bulk density is increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organic matter is going to jump all
over the place based on bulk density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make an assumption with topsoil
bulk density assumption that's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty accurate, but in peat based media,
it's really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually a new peat based media is going
to show high organic matter and high CEC
[SPEAKER_01]: right out of the bag because it's fluffy
and it's full of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those numbers are going to jump
wildly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are two issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two more issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to just present one
more, which is that this may be the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest issue, in my opinion, is not the
technical nature of how they test it and
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more around what do you do with the
number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the purpose of testing,
if you're going to pay money to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: test, it's to determine some kind of
action you can take as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there's no management action
that you can take with 40% organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%, then to me, that's the biggest issue
with any metric because the purpose of
[SPEAKER_01]: these soil tests is to take some kind of
valuable information and then go apply it
[SPEAKER_01]: via action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not tied at all to the CEC,
directly at least?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the measurement is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's very little correlation
between those two numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is ignore organic
matter percentage if you're not testing
[SPEAKER_00]: actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are testing actual soil,
how does the application of compost come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play?
[SPEAKER_00]: In effecting that organic matter and
giving us an accurate number of what our
[SPEAKER_00]: percent really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I could imagine if I applied
compost earlier in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: tilted in or top dressed it, I take my
sample, some of it ends up in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample, remember, is only half a
teaspoon of actual material when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the Malik 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great point because the first
problem I talked about, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're testing PMOS or immature compost and
not organic matter in the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, that problem exists outdoors too
where loads of compost have been applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you apply compost, your organic matter
jumps from 2% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're super proud of yourself,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just measuring the carbon from
your compost, which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that your carbon inputs are high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is one of the many variables that
leads to the formation of stable organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not true organic matter by the
traditional definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that too is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked at a lot of small organic
vegetable growers and they use large
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of compost and their organic
matter is very, very high on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also when compost is applied,
it goes through a multi-year decomposition
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that number is going to jump all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that organic matter number gives
you a little bit of information,
[SPEAKER_01]: like this soil has been cultivated,
it has high organic inputs, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily something that should be
managed very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in a conventional broad acre cropping
system, the organic matter number should
[SPEAKER_01]: be looked at over, I would say,
a five to 10 year horizon and not a year
[SPEAKER_01]: to year number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to your point, there's organic
matter variation in soils as there is in
[SPEAKER_01]: just everything in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are going to see a little bit of
fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't see large, like full
percentage points, but you'll see maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: tenths or even a half of a percent
fluctuation year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really should be looking at it over
a five or 10 year horizon, even in real
[SPEAKER_01]: top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very crude measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that organic matter is one of
the most important things for organic
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and for soil health and for
plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a really tough thing to measure
accurately when your soil test costs 50
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking for trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it trending in the right direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moving up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moving down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a pea based media, just to be
clear, I wouldn't even worry about the
[SPEAKER_01]: trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen it jump all over the place
based on the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to ignore it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sticking on the topic of nutrients,
we were going to talk about ratios versus
[SPEAKER_00]: levels because you get these ratios of
what your cations are made up of.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of it is calcium?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is that relative to just the
actual values in pounds per acre of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, magnesium and potassium in terms
of sufficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Racial conversation is fun because people
throw around a lot of ratios and it
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on the kind of tests you're
taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I look at ratios on both a
tissue test and a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at ratios on the standard tests
like base cation percentages as well as on
[SPEAKER_01]: the pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ratios that I think matter the
most, I've always really looked at calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: to potassium as a ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at that primarily on the tissue
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also look at iron to manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another very popular one that I
don't necessarily put a lot of weight on,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is nitrogen to potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what you're asking is probably
around the standard test base cation
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the soluble cation ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, on the soil tests, a very common
sort of like Albrecht based approach is to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what I call BCSR and it's the
percentages of cations extracted by the
[SPEAKER_01]: male like three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all over the internet on all kinds of
different websites, there's these
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages that generally fall between
like 70, 68 to 80% calcium, 10 to 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and three to 7% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at those, but I don't put a lot of
weight on them because I prefer when
[SPEAKER_01]: managing a peat based media for cannabis
production, I like looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that regard, I do look at the
percentages because what those percentages
[SPEAKER_01]: are telling you is balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my general approach to nutrient
management is you have to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient nutrient levels and then you
want to work toward balance between those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a perfectly balanced,
you can have perfectly balanced cation
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, let's say on the pace test,
but it doesn't actually matter if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just not enough food in that soil for
those plants to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how balanced it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing I do is I have
sufficiency levels of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing I do is I look at
those percentages and I really like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium generally at about 50%,
magnesium at about 20 and potassium at
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who are doing the math,
that leaves 10% to be allocated elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes that goes to sodium and
sometimes it goes to one of those other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients just based on fluctuations or
how you like to run your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've found is that that is by far
most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most correlated to the actual
tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, it's correlated to those
standard test BCSR ratios, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: usually, what sort of translates is
usually about 7% potassium on the standard
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like to go above 12% magnesium on
the standard test and I always want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: above 60%, ideally well above 70% on
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually those will lead to the right
soil solution balance, but I don't manage
[SPEAKER_01]: for that standard test percentage because
it's sort of the tail that wags the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go right to the pace test and I look at
sufficiency and balance on the pace test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I want to reiterate what you
just said there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soluble salt level on your soil,
your EC is low, like let's say you had 200
[SPEAKER_00]: ppm on soluble salts, that soil,
it doesn't matter if it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run out of nutrients
relatively quickly versus a soil with a
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher EC or soluble salt level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's important because I've
seen some soil tests from folks where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything looks balanced, but at the end
of the day, if the amount of fertility is
[SPEAKER_00]: low, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run out and you're going
to have to add nutrients and those aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to necessarily be balanced anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a really important point
you brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as you're looking at this,
when we talk about hitting sufficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: first, just switching topics here,
one of the things we talked about was
[SPEAKER_00]: luxury nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get concerned about excesses
and toxicities when we talk about our
[SPEAKER_00]: major cations and ions versus say things
that you're not too worried if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of sulfur, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so every nutrient, by the way,
is a separate topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're all very different and how
I look at each one, how I look at each one
[SPEAKER_01]: on the soil test is they're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer your question, the worst
cation to have in excess is sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an essential plant nutrient and
it simply puts undue pressure on the
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical conductivity and the osmotic
pressure that it exerts on roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a perfect world, you'd have zero PPM
of sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's impossible in organic
soil-based systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sodium is low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst thing to have in excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, it's very mobile so you can leach
it out or flush it out of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing would be magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not in your water, I want to
highlight that because some people have
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium in their water or they're using
conditioners to their water that's adding
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flushing high sodium soils with sodium
water doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the one thing about high sodium
water, how you can manage it a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: method is you accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the water we've got elevated in
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't filter it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just water, water, water,
and then you flush because what happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: the water evaporates, leaves the sodium
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the levels start to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can theoretically flush that
out even with your high sodium water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's never going to get it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to revert back to whatever
your water level is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, to your point, you can never
manage to zero if it's in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one though I want to bring up,
which is a tricky one in organic
[SPEAKER_01]: peat-based media, is magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And magnesium is often high, often
excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not needed in nearly the quantity
that calcium and potassium are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can really create sort of this
gentle antagonism that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily going to see visually,
but it's slowing down your plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing yield and crop quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium is a tough one to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: My approach is I like to set a minimum
sufficient level for magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have an optimization algorithm
that changes the level of calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If magnesium is high, to just try to
maintain balance, because those are always
[SPEAKER_01]: competing for one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm looking at both the pace test,
the percentage on the pace test,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the percentage on the on the maleic
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I never apply any
magnesium if the percentage is above 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what tends to happen is when you
apply gypsum, it opens up and magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: flows into solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium is one of the more
complicated things to look at and manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as easy when you have,
excess magnesium, I still think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: leach your soil, you'll see those levels
drop, especially the soluble levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're never actually going to be able
to pull it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key is you just try to minimize the
inputs with high magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, sometimes very rarely I'll
recommend a little dolomitic lime in a
[SPEAKER_01]: real topsoil, but never in a peat based
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really the only source,
the only two sources of magnesium I'm ever
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending might be a little bit of like
potassium magnesium sulfate, it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it langbenite as the mineral name,
but there's different trade names like K
[SPEAKER_01]: mag or sulpomag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then otherwise, I think Epsom salt as
a foliar is a great way to just give small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of magnesium to your plant as
needed based on visual symptoms or tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're never applying it to the soil
to push those levels up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like running that a little bit low
and maintaining plenty of sufficiency and
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a weighted balance toward calcium
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always run magnesium low in our soils
because I know it's so easy to add via
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salt and affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll actually on occasion do Epsom
salt drenches just like a tablespoon per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of water when we see that magnesium
level drop, but I like the foliar idea
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of something being
something you could really flush very
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume if you did, you're also going
to have to add a lot of fertility back in
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've absolutely flushed the more
mobile nutrients out to like phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, potassium, things like that,
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and everything on the pace test is
going to be mobile because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: floating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you leach heavily because you have
an excess of something, everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like a hard refresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, like, yeah, when I see
something with sodium, maybe over 45 parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million on the pace test, the soil
doctor tool will recommend or my
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations will recommend leaching
your soil and that'll flush everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to reset,
retest and re-amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that over the long term is a far
better approach to plant health than just
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to push.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sodium, some strains and in some
operations, sodium is OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to create excess osmotic
stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting a more you're getting
more efficient metabolism when it's lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's having to work harder in that
soil to access nutrients, essentially is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is in certain crop species like
a substitution effect that happens where
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts using sodium instead of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is less efficient metabolically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then let's move on to a couple of
the other touch on some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've talked about magnesium and sodium
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another one that you've talked
about two relatively antagonistic ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want to monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another one you want to monitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing just to mention on
these cations is a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: influenced by more than the levels and the
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're influenced by evapotranspiration
and irrigation technique and root size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can't stress enough that it's
really, really, really valuable to use
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue testing to validate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because oftentimes you can have enough
calcium, but you don't see enough in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a different issue you need to
address entirely like watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe your relative humidity or your
VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tissue testing is really a good way to
make sure that there aren't other issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to talk about other nutrients,
I mean, nitrogen is a fascinating one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that I do think of all the
nutrients, I generally recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining fairly stable concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal in organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes are breaking down,
amendments and releasing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are uptaking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients are being sort of leached to the
bottom of your beds when you water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of different things
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal should be to really try to
maintain consistent levels, sufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels throughout the entire round of most
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nitrogen is a little different in the
sense that it's going to be taken up
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly and in high quantities by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, I like to have
high but not excessive levels through veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like nitrogen levels to draw down
through veg to sort of to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon and nitrogen balance in the plant
with the theory that you're sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing quality or terpene expression
with lower nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean zero nitrogen at all,
because you still need nitrogen for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism and production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protein synthesis and flower development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of that nitrogen is actually
being moved from the plant's existing
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's already a lot of nitrogen
that's taken up through the plant cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant is then using in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nitrogen uptake really goes down
and you can create some issues by running
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen too hard too late in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that one is interesting to me
because I do think that should be measured
[SPEAKER_01]: and it should be managed a little bit
differently by not necessarily maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: the same concentration through the entire
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have high nitrogen,
you'll see you'll have very like larpy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that just won't yield and they'll
be super dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see it, but rarely because most of
the time we can control nitrogen through
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have too much nitrogen,
it's pretty easy to lower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one question I did have for you that
we didn't answer was for people who do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to flush, how much water do you
recommend by volume to run through an
[SPEAKER_00]: average soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so one thing about flushing is I
don't think it's great to do in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of a round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a really good draining soil,
then go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that it can create more
harm than good if your soil doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have high drainage capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to wait until after you harvest to
leach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no magic way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one way to do it is you just water
your beds, your pots, and you just measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the EC of the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I generally say just wherever your EC
is, keep watering until it's 50% of where
[SPEAKER_01]: you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one method.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other method would be to, I just say,
water until 6 inches or 12 inches run out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bottom of the pots or the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on the severity of what
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've failed for heavy metals or if
you have 150 ppm of sodium on the pace
[SPEAKER_01]: test and you just want, like I said,
a hard refresh, then just really go for it
[SPEAKER_01]: until you get a foot of runoff or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really kind of depends on the
severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no magic number that necessarily,
it really depends on what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess for me, the situations where
I may want to leach mid-round is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a soil test back from a commercial
grower who's mid-flower, plants aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see on this test they've got 300 ppm of
nitrates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to have a conversation
like, hey, we're going to get a yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not going to be the yield that
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we stress the plant by overwatering it
where you're potentially impacting the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology of the soil, you're killing some
root hairs, you're causing plant stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to lower that nitrate
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better, I guess, is the scenario
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would your thought be with a
hypothetical like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you, it just totally depends on
the composition of the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's like a horizontal system or
something that just, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not, well, that's not
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was a horizontal system,
I would still, what I would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend mid-round is to do a slower
leaching event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do like multiple pulses that are
sort of pushing the water like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still pulling air into the profile
between each leaching event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of just one, like, you know,
four hour irrigation set, I might just say
[SPEAKER_01]: water to run off six times in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would give more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are, are, are many people doing a
horizontal system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't, we don't work with
anyone that grows like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's somewhat popular online,
but I feel like the challenge is with
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, like you mentioned, and
fertility sort of move me away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that several people who have
received solar recommendations from me are
[SPEAKER_01]: using it, but I'm not actively engaged to
having conversations with them on a weekly
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think, I mean, I've heard a
lot of people doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just think like I've mixed media
doing tests that is extremely poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've mixed media where I incorporate
five or 10% of my topsoil from my farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: change the drainage dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I think you can reach,
I just get a little bit nervous about it
[SPEAKER_01]: because everyone has a different
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in pots, when you have a true
feed-based media and pots, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just water until you get heavy runoff
and there's no issue whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just for listeners, like if you if
we're talking about ProMix, that's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different conversation than talking about
something that's, oh, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, has actual topsoil in it
and is some sort of horizontal system
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not going to drain the same,
that you're going to have some perched
[SPEAKER_00]: water challenges and other things with
water movement through the media
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, enough on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we could probably do a whole
podcast just on nitrogen, but was there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else you wanted to touch on
besides the fact that nitrogen really
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be managed and you can't
absolutely have too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, there's a million things we talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are interesting to me from a
nitrogen standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that the only other
thought I want to throw out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks is when you're using our organic
nitrogen amendments, all of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: including amino acids, have to go through
the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe even on the last podcast
here for the last several years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally thought and I have been told
from other experienced agronomists and
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants that that amino acid uptake is
much more metabolically efficient and it
[SPEAKER_01]: saves the plant the enormous amount of
energy because the plant doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert nitrate back into amino acids to
create plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just uses the amino acids directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my thinking on that has actually
evolved quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't actually think that plants are
uptaking amino acids in significant
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities at all, because I've reviewed a
lot of the research on amino acid uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually think most of it's getting
converted into ammonium and then nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant takes it up and then it gets
converted back into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is true that theoretically you get a
huge metabolic savings if the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: uptakes amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my belief is that the microbes feed
first in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to take those amino
acids and convert it into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I like amino acids is because
of the particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either they're in liquid form or they're
in a powdered form that you can feed and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very quickly evaporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very quickly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really gives you more control as
a grower when it comes to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to mention that all
organic amendments are amino based.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all protein based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're enzymatically broken down into
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even when you apply alfalfa meal,
that is a sort of amino based source of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a much larger particle size that
takes longer to break down in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of an interesting thing to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more about particle size than I do
about the source of the nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether the label says amino acids or
whether the label says soybean meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my thinking's evolved on that a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where I was going with that
other than, oh, the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing I think growers need to
think about is when you apply a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of amendments, organic amendments,
that microbial action that breaks those
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments down is consuming a lot of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that it's usually pretty
intuitive and pretty well understood that
[SPEAKER_01]: you should let your soil cook before
planting is because all those amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: are turning into ammonium before they turn
into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ammonium is really not a preferred
plant available source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that process, those microbes are
consuming a tremendous amount of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a huge challenge for growers
because people are trying to flip into the
[SPEAKER_01]: next round as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you don't have three weeks
to let your soil cook or let those
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so honestly, if you can never let your
soil get so depleted that you're applying
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous amounts of those organic
amendments, that's the best solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just kind of constantly either top
dressing or feeding nitrogen as the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you never let your nitrate get to 2
ppm and have to apply like massive amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of any of these amendments because once
you plant into it, those young plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to like the high ammonium,
low oxygen environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting because the way I've
always described it and correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong on this, but my understanding is as
we add a lot of nutrients, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I've noticed that different nitrogen
sources will create different microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and different sort of
bacterial blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things seem to be more balanced
from a microbial perspective like alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: meal versus some of these other
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've always described it as sort of
like you add all these nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've created this feast for all the
bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria is sort of an exostermic
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generating heat as they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's creating this, it's essentially
thermally composting your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant roots also don't like a lot of
that temperature and they may not be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to access the nutrients as efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the microbes feed first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if there's sufficient fertility in
that soil, if the bacteria is actively
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing at high levels, then those
nutrients aren't going to be available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see deficiencies expressed
in the plant, even though probably due to
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, excess ammonium,
root hair death from soil temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a variety of factors potentially
affecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we try to do is, like you said,
you have high fertility in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to re-amend and by having a larger
volume of soil like in a bed, when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to re-amend, you don't have to add as much
nutrients as you would to that same volume
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil if it was grown in like a seven
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to, it's not going to
heat up, it's not going to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: quite those extremes and it doesn't need
to sit as long too, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to keep things moving along here,
what are some of the ones that you aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had mentioned sulfur as sort
of a luxury nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some other ones that you're like,
okay, there may be a little too much here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not too concerned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, if I had a magic wand,
I would reduce sulfur, just because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's putting on new pressure on EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But besides that, I have no issues with
high sulfur and I actually just think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, in order to get high calcium and
high potassium, you just sort of have to
[SPEAKER_01]: use, you're going to see high sulfur and
that applies to compost too, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, you're going to see high sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't create real negative
effects in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, if I could just wave a
magic wand, I would reduce it because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: in luxury levels and it's putting upward
pressure on EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really like high levels of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked running high levels of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen real negative effects from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always liked, I don't want to say
high levels of any micronutrient because
[SPEAKER_01]: that can, you can run into issues,
but compared to other crops and other just
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of target levels of nutrients,
I generally like slightly high manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I see luxury levels of manganese,
I'm not too worried about it as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not surpassing iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the tissue test isn't
showing anything super out of whack luxury
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, potassium can be pretty high
without concern, especially again,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as the calcium levels are high
enough on the tissue test and weak to a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, I think having pretty high
potassium levels is not a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I want anything to be too
excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the things I just named can be
excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally just looked at the soil test
and I recommended leaching because
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium was too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sort of putting my foot in my
mouth, but I think those three nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: generally I like to see in pretty high
levels that cannabis plants generally
[SPEAKER_01]: respond well to high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are just more concerning,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of their detrimental or negative
effects at high levels versus others that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, okay, it's high, but you're
still going to get a good crop out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously we're talking about like,
it depends on how high, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a pretty big range,
I guess is my point that the plants will
[SPEAKER_01]: do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, yeah, I mean, it's not like
chloride or sodium or copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw copper at 60 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be really worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little bit about,
let's talk about some of the stuff you
[SPEAKER_00]: have going on here because we've given out
a lot of information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have other resources available through
soil doctor consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those things that people
can utilize you for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much my two major offerings of
things that I obsess about every day and
[SPEAKER_01]: think about all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year I put together a course called
Become a Cannabis Soil Expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a course that includes over 12
hours of self-guided video content that
[SPEAKER_01]: details really everything about organic
nutrient management in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers can become more self-sufficient
in managing their nutrition in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put a lot of time into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different modules and
dozens of videos that really just dive
[SPEAKER_01]: into the fundamentals of techniques and
soil targets and plant tissue targets and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to amend soil and essentially write
their own program, taking control and
[SPEAKER_01]: having the confidence to do all this stuff
organically in-house with data and
[SPEAKER_01]: precision, which is something that I think
has been lacking in the industry for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I've been working on
obsessively every single day is this soil
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor tool, which is a digital,
I'll call it just a tool that's intended
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of be a digital agronomist for
nutrient management in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers enter a few pieces of
information about their grow along with
[SPEAKER_01]: soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tool spits out a precision organic
nutrient recommendation to assist in
[SPEAKER_01]: making a decision about what to apply to
your soil and in what quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it uses a fairly complex mathematical
model to really determine the rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dive into that, but I don't want
to gloss over your soil course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little more about that
before we move on, because I've taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably the best online tool
for cannabis growers that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to properly amend your
soil, how to soil test, what the different
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments are and how to utilize them in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give a lot of information in there and
the ability to comment on the modules,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the short videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to do it over a period of a few
weeks, just kind of diving in and watching
[SPEAKER_00]: a video here and there when I had time,
kind of letting it mull over and process
[SPEAKER_00]: and then coming back to it, asking
questions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't want to just skip over
the fact that this is a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive course that you've put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone who's working on putting
together like a botany course and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other tools, I know how much work went
into that to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your positive words.
[SPEAKER_01]: The positive feedback I've gotten from you
and other growers has been really
[SPEAKER_01]: humbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding to that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what are some of the things that
you've... I know you've gone back and made
[SPEAKER_00]: some changes as you're learning too,
which I think is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added a top soil module.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were originally five modules,
probably 10 hours of content, and I added
[SPEAKER_01]: a sixth one on outdoor cultivation,
which really was my bread and butter years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just kind of go into the
different tools, techniques, cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques, irrigation techniques,
and ultimately nutrient management methods
[SPEAKER_01]: for outdoor topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the biggest addition in the
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also go through and I update
things as I learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I change some of the target levels as I
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do that on a six month basis,
and I only update the course when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: codified.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll change things in my agronomic model
or my consulting practice a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll let that run for six months
before I update the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the course is sort of the encyclopedia,
and I try not to update it too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm on there constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as someone asks a question or if
there's any conversation happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on there that day within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the updates happen usually on a six
month basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would say, I'd be curious to hear,
Tad, for listeners, on a scale of one to
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, what is the technical nature of the
course, would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 being very technical, very advanced
growers only, one being beginner growers
[SPEAKER_01]: who are in their first cycle in a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a sliding scale a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first section of the course,
to me, was sort of information I already
[SPEAKER_00]: knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fairly basic in nature,
just to give you an outline of what these
[SPEAKER_00]: different amendments are, what are your
options for nitrogen, what are your
[SPEAKER_00]: options for phosphorus, potassium,
these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you get further into the
course, it gets sort of as technical as
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to be in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience that listens to this podcast
is pretty savvy and pretty technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've interviewed geneticists and
neuroscientists and people like yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: that are experts in their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like I'm kind of dancing
around the answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this course is for anyone who's
really passionate about soil science and
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to understand the why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's one thing to be able to take
a soil test and send it off to a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant or plug it into a calculator
and get a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's another thing to kind of
understand what's actually going on so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can make actionable decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd throw it, I guess, overall,
maybe a seven or an eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I think it makes sense is either
you're a hobbyist and you're super
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about soil science and
gardening, or if you're a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator that's using organics and not
working closely with an agronomist or a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant or a company that can do those
things for you, then I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge you absolutely need to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will add that it's not a low price point
of entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expensive course because of the
amount of time and energy and research
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes into it, not just in creating
it, but learning the material to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to teach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's very affordable when we
talk about a commercial cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a tent grower, it may not be in the
budget unless it's something you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that kind of answer it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that curiosity because I don't know
what level it's at to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think I asked that just because
I wanted maybe to highlight the fact that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's for passionate growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a dabbling course,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the first module is like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like taking a course in soil science
with an emphasis on soil testing and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think soil is media in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to understand why the local
agronomist doesn't give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for your cannabis grow
because they're looking at a Logan soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test and trying to understand why your
potting soil is performing differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this would explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it covers liquid feed recipes
and foliars and various subtopics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the basis and the meat of the
course is organic soil-based or I guess we
[SPEAKER_01]: should have pea-based cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think people often ask, would it
benefit me if I'm not an organic grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is some of the principles,
the principles, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the targets and the general
approach is definitely an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really talk about urea or
polymer-coated fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much an organic-based approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll let you move on to explaining
the tool now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tool is an extension of this
general philosophy that comes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: course too, which is test, don't guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: My approach with the course and with this
tool is to recommend only what's needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this tool, you enter information about
your grow, your soil tests, and it does
[SPEAKER_01]: this complex mathematical calculation to
determine amendment rates and it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite of the traditional kitchen sink
approach in which we throw every
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-stimulant, enzyme, ferment,
microbe, and nutrient at the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers can still do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply your special sauce,
whether that's a fungal compost extract or
[SPEAKER_01]: a high-end silica foliar, a micronized
calcium or KNF ferment, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: in addition to the amendments from the
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tool is really supposed to hit the
low-hanging fruit, and it does so with
[SPEAKER_01]: data and precision because the industry
has always been so full of blood blaster
[SPEAKER_01]: Rx for terpenes or biocatalyzed for
microbes or whatever, folic biochar,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouted, CalMag, foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a lot of things when I grow
cannabis and in my orchard that are beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: just the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess my point is you have to start
with the fundamentals first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure that nutrients are
sufficient, available, balanced before all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this tool is really intended to
make very accurate recommendations to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that all of the macro and
micronutrients essential for the plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: in your soil in the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to go back and highlight what
you just said because that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see companies marketing product-based
grow methodologies all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like add this product, add that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you can use all of
these ferments and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, if you don't
have sufficiency in your major nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be your limiting factor of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always start with what's my limiting
factor of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's fertility, I want to figure
out what cation or anion it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you apply some sort of pumpkin
extract and you get a plant response,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to figure out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than continuing to buy a product
that's mostly liquid and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: overpriced, I want to know what is in
there that's making a difference because
[SPEAKER_00]: it means you have something that's
limiting your plant's health or growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so start with sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with a good foundation, like you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that's interesting because
when I first started, I started off using
[SPEAKER_00]: these soil calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial ones were based off of getting
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not necessarily optimal yields when we
talk about cannabis, but just an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency or not even sufficiency,
but higher levels of nutrient fertility to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that that grown edible crop is
going to be healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of this Steve Solomon's approach,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get some good information from
there and those calculators are not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've seen other calculators come
out for cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, there's more information I
want than just what's on a soil test when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm evaluating a garden and trying to make
a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tool that you put together has
other variables associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you kind of talk about what
those are and why they're important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I think about, I just want to step
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think about photosynthesis,
I think about light, I think about CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: water, temperature, and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this tool is only focused on the
nutrient part of it, helping growers
[SPEAKER_01]: understand and apply nutrients in a
better, more precise way to focus on that
[SPEAKER_01]: bottleneck of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your environment's off, this tool
isn't necessarily going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not watering correctly,
this doesn't, it's not going to address
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you've been really good
at pointing out that this isn't a panacea
[SPEAKER_01]: for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like an automated, you know,
it's not going to solve all your problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea here is it's focused on
nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the variables, when you go into the
tool, you set up an area and you choose
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're indoor or outdoor,
because that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also choose your cycle length because
the tool changes nutrient levels slightly,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on if your plants are going to
be in the soil for less than 12 weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: longer than 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, the nitrogen amendment
quantities are increased a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long-term or full-term crop versus a
soil intended for like a nine-week flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add that the difference here is
relatively small, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to maintain concentrations as
opposed to trying to preload too heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a happy balance that the tool
is trying to achieve there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also asks you for your soil volume,
which is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: As anyone who's grown in a seven gallon
pot versus a 30 gallon pot, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tool actually takes your soil
volume and it outputs the quantity of
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments for your entire soil volume,
as well as per just a cubic yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of choose which way you go
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also, when you're setting up
an area, asks for your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an interesting conversation
that we've had, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost might be the biggest variable in
living soil nutrient management,
[SPEAKER_01]: because all composts are wildly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tool asks for the nutrient levels
on the compost from a compost analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which most growers don't have,
and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have it, it asks for what
the compost is made out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least it can make an estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can model the nutrient numbers based on
the feedstocks of that compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add to that, because one of
the things we're going to talk about with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil recipes, but I don't think we have
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing I want to highlight
there is that I see people in forums still
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time saying, oh, I'm going to run
Mike's mix or John's bloom mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really all of these online soil
recipes are going to be somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurate just because they're all going
to be sourced from different compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want to formulate a soil
or a potting soil or a media correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to start being formulated around
what fertility is in your compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to throw that out.
100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: A compost made out of fish and hardwood
aged for a year versus a compost made out
[SPEAKER_01]: of yard waste turned six times in six
weeks in middle America versus a compost
[SPEAKER_01]: made out of lobster waste on the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrient profile between those three
is striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference in the nutrient profile is
striking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the only other thing that you
would enter in the soil doctor tool in the
[SPEAKER_01]: area section is your preferred nitrogen
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers get to choose up to four
nitrogen amendments that the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation will use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our default is usually to use four soybean
meal, alfalfa meal, granular poultry
[SPEAKER_01]: manure and blood meal to optimize nitrogen
release rates and microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't really matter, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing is for
growers to do their own research and
[SPEAKER_01]: choose the best sources of nitrogen for
their operation and for their values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very subtle pros and cons of
nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is that people can customize
the output a bit based on their amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, the inputs to the model
are taking as many things as possible that
[SPEAKER_01]: influence nutrient management and trying
to account for those and trying to change
[SPEAKER_01]: the recommendations and trying to model
the entire nutrient system in an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: way and use data from both the state
standard and pace test to spit out a
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated recommendation as a guidance
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to tell people the
recommendations are guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, OK, based on all the
information I have, here's the best advice
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a fairly comprehensive
recommendation with notes about the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and precision recommendations and a bunch
of tips about how to apply the amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The report is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of what I've been
working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it's like five years in the
making because I've just gone so deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: this that there's just a lot of dozens of
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've looked at like 5,000
peat-based soil tests and done calibration
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments and taken just classic
agronomic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to incorporate it into this
one tool for growers to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had looked into doing something
like this years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I just realized I didn't have
the brainpower to calculate for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables that I really wanted to in a
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've gotten more in there than
anyone else I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty impressive, honestly,
that you were able to pull that together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, when I sit down with a
grower or Brandon, who works with me on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we'll look at, because we're having
a conversation with the grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have them send us photos and we look at
videos sometimes of their grow space or
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll look at, can we look at photos of
the plant up close if you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges plus the entire plant so we can
look at for hidden and mobile nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check on what their environment is,
all of these different things that can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect, again, just trying to figure out
what that limiting factor of growth is and
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is indeed fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But barring the ability to do a full on
comprehensive console, which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you offer too, if people want to go
down that route, I think this is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: available online tool out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I were a grower and just looking to
get, I had a soil test and I needed to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a result, and I wanted to do it
affordably, I would absolutely use your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil doctor tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those things where it's
like, I sort of leave it up to head
[SPEAKER_01]: growers or you and Brandon or IPM experts
to really identify the top latent
[SPEAKER_01]: environment or a watering issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things I just can't
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't address all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tool is really intended to be,
it is intended to be like just focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: one specific area where you guys could use
the tool in your more holistic analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, yeah, I wouldn't call this a
holistic agronomic tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a nutrient, organic nutrient
management tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've already been talking for over
an hour here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk to you all day, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of our conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always learn something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to
share though, before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we do sometimes, even in
preparation, you called me, asked me to
[SPEAKER_01]: come on and we ended up talking for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to burn an hour talking about
these topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, there's nothing else that's
popping out in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something I've been really excited
about and thinking just more about in
[SPEAKER_01]: general is just particle size of
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always the topic of water and
pH adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we actually addressed that in
our in the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to chat about that at a
later point on a live video or another
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, because those are big topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd love to get you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, lately, what's been on my mind is
watering as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's always something that I'm
always thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned I just got a bunch of
houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm learning how to water
differently for different plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: different media, which has been really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also heavy metals, just there's
so much there that we have to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many variables that affect
heavy metal uptake that it's one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: topics that I just I keep learning more
and more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested in more because I also
think about my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned this the other day on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in I was in Costco the other day and
I was looking at some organically grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to remember the vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been let's just let's just
say tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was looking organic tomatoes grown in
Mexico versus greenhouse grown tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: conventionally grown in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually going to be healthier
for my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones in Mexico, I don't really know
what the heavy metals levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably weren't a ton of pesticides
applied necessarily or other inputs that I
[SPEAKER_00]: might have issue with on that greenhouse
or the greenhouse grown tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely I'm definitely thinking less
in terms of organics versus like
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional and more in terms of like
healthy and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think a lot about nutrient
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Solomon was I find a major like
pioneer in that space for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got started with his book probably 10
years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is just such a it is such an
important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious if ever in our lifetime,
we're going to be able to quantify that be
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I think a lot about is
because I know how crops are grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them, not all of them,
but sometimes I know what's more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: be sprayed and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, strawberries,
for example, is freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like sometimes sometimes I think
that stuff got pretty pest and disease
[SPEAKER_01]: free crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there's so many it's a it's a
very complicated world when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: importing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I again, I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's another conversation that
people are interested to, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've been thinking about a lot
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me leave one more thought for
the cannabis community as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in like this this era of sort of low
prices and a contraction in the market and
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Costco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think three years ago, I did a big
fun project with a massive organic
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry farm in Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did this big analysis and spent many
days on the farm walking around their
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge farm like I got lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find the exit of the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were their fertility budget was a
thousand dollars per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were spending a thousand dollars
on organic inputs, liquid fish,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrolysis, gypsum, microbes, like a lot
of the stuff that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was blown away because a thousand
dollars breakers a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I asked him about that,
the farm manager, he just made it really
[SPEAKER_01]: clear that when you're growing a high
value crop, you can't skimp on your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to say have an unlimited
fertility budget for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that because I am a fan of
precision and not throwing the kitchen
[SPEAKER_01]: sink at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think people should forever be
thinking about fertility and inputs and
[SPEAKER_01]: really focusing on nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to achieve a high value
crop of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to leave it on that
note, because I think that other
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crops have really figured
that out and they don't ever skimp on
[SPEAKER_01]: their fertility budget in a premium
market, even when prices are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, when I think about that,
I think about my inputs being high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense of like, I'm not going to buy
a shoddy biochar or cheap earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find a higher quality source,
I'm willing to pay a little extra for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to know that what I'm getting is going to
offer me all the benefits of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do see a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it comes back to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost is one of those things I will not
skimp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is one of those things I will not
skimp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking at two different alfalfa
meals or fish meal or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might go with the lower price one or
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find a cheaper version of gypsum
and they're relatively similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I have no problem saving money there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good soil makes growing fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go high quality and then use precision to
just apply only what you need and save the
[SPEAKER_01]: money in not applying excessive things,
but apply high quality things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in a living soil system or when
you're just reusing your soil round after
[SPEAKER_01]: round, or if you have a topsoil where it's
not going anywhere and your kids are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to inherit it, the quality does matter and
the microbial communities over time really
[SPEAKER_01]: do respond well to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for the marketing hype that you
see all over social media these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, have a wonderful rest of your
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time and let's do this
again sometime soon.
