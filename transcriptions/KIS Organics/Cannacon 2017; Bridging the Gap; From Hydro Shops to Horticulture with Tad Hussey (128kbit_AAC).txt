[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're privileged to have Tad Hudson
here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to talk to you about maybe
opening up your mind a little bit and
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at best practices, not just from
what has been in what I call the vertical
[SPEAKER_05]: or endemic business, which has always been
part of the cannabis hydro scene,
[SPEAKER_05]: but looking out at the larger agricultural
horticultural, what's out there in the
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum of the big picture as we grow
into big ag business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's bring on Tad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a microphone up front.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would like this to be interactive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you have questions, just come on
up, stand in front, and we will recognize
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much, and let's hear it
for Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can hear me OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I want to say is there's no
need to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have the transcript from how I
expected this talk to go, at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: up on our website on kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the first blog post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything, all the resources,
and everything that I mentioned in this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, I will have links to on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just sit back and relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole presentation is not going to use
the full hour, so we'll have plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: time for questions at the end if you have
any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I'd like to start with,
is I'd like to just take a moment and have
[SPEAKER_00]: you think back and remember the very first
time you saw a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for me, that was in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember distinctly walking down into
this gentleman's basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he opened the door, I was hit
with this overwhelming odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights were so bright, I was
squinting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like being transported into a whole
other world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this sort of power and
mysticism about this plant, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never experienced before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I grew up with my parents owning
a retail nursery and landscape company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around plants since the day I
was born, but I had no experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this journey and getting to
see this plant in person, it really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested me, and it brought me to my
first hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first experience in a hydro shop,
walking in, I felt like I was being
[SPEAKER_00]: transported back to my high school
chemistry class.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were all these bottles on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard of or never seen before,
and I'd been to a lot of nurseries and
[SPEAKER_00]: garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, it got me really excited to
try them all out and find out if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get this massive growth that they were
claiming on a lot of these bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had never seen marketing like this
with these photos of cartoonish pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of beautiful women and these monster
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally new to me, and not something that
you find in your typical garden center or
[SPEAKER_00]: outside in the ag world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, throughout this journey, I was
fortunate to have people like my father
[SPEAKER_00]: here who taught me a lot of what I know
about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually after he had washed his
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're literally stained like that from
years and years of just digging in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded the nursery, and then when he
sold the nursery, started a compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of when I came in around
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, I was fortunate to
have a good background in science and
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just gotten back from grad school in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was our laboratory setup in terms
of being able to have a phase contract
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope and take video and actually
look at these soil microorganisms up close
[SPEAKER_00]: and really delve into what was going on in
our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along this process, I was really fortunate
to meet some really wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Jeff Lowenfels, author of
Teaming with Microbes, Teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, and his latest book,
Teaming with Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful author.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a chance to hear him
speak, he's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful speaker, and these are great
books to check out if anything in this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, I also became good
friends with Tim Wilson of Microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics, one of the foremost experts on
compost teas, and some of his works have
[SPEAKER_00]: even been published in the Smithsonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Lang Ingham of the Soil Food Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father was one of the very first soil
food web advisors, and we worked hand in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand with her in establishing brewing
times for compost teas, whether or not E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli would reproduce, in these brews,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, some other
wonderful people like Steve Solomon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Erica Reinheimer, and a gentleman who goes
by the online name of Clackamas Coot,
[SPEAKER_00]: who people have started entire businesses
and commercial soil mixes around a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: his concepts and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 2011, we opened Keep It Simple
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a salmon spawning trail that goes
right down along this creek, and we give
[SPEAKER_00]: tours to kids on native habitat,
and there's an outdoor preschool on the
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our tobacco starts last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a U-pick for the community and also
grow organic veggie starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff has a lot of fun with their
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have squash and corn and some
watermelon over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful property and a great
place to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the giant pumpkins that we
grew last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow them for the community,
and they get to guess the weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the preschool kids get to come in
with their hammers and smash away at it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have piglets and pigs, goats,
turkeys, bees, and we just started baby
[SPEAKER_00]: chick season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very fortunate in the fact that I get
to talk to people about chickens and
[SPEAKER_00]: ducks, and then the next person in may
have a question about soil science,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we're talking about apple trees or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really fortunate to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe by applying some of these
principles that I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: today in regards to science and research
that already exists in the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: and agriculture world, we can dramatically
reduce our costs on conventional bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient programs by up to 70% or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I'd like to talk to you
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first thing I'd like to suggest
is that you consider going organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for some of you before your eyes
glaze over, my goal today is to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling arguments for why it makes
sense from both an economic and an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental perspective, and address
such issues as bugs, quality, yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many people know, cannabis has been in
the news more recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, public perception of
cannabis has been damaged quite a bit by
[SPEAKER_00]: the illegal pesticides and plant growth
hormones, things that are not approved for
[SPEAKER_00]: use on edible crops that have been found
in some of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big concern, I think,
in terms of how our industry is perceived,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a big issue in terms of safety of
our medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from an environmental perspective,
when we are fertilizing with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these chemical fertilizers, we have to
think about where this product's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the excess nitrates and
phosphates that leach out of these soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes are going down into our groundwater,
which creates algal blooms and dead zones
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ocean, which kills off a lot of
marine life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these products are made using
fossil fuels and are transported all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way from China, so there's a huge cost
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I'd like to mention is a
story in regards to my experiences with
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting a few of these 502 farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the mineral salts are mixed up in
these giant IBC totes, and at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities I've visited, I've literally
seen them being dumped down the drain into
[SPEAKER_00]: septic systems or sewage systems,
literally polluting the groundwater that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not going to be too much
longer before we have a huge issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to either the EPA or the state
coming down and creating regulations or
[SPEAKER_00]: finding companies for this sort of
behavior, something to consider in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to how you're managing your nutrient
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you write me off as a tree-hugging
liberal, I'd like to give you some other
[SPEAKER_00]: good reasons for going organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2015, Consumer Reports found that 24
to 60% of higher price for organic produce
[SPEAKER_00]: over conventional produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't directly translate to
cannabis production because there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: currently an organic standard for
cannabis, but there are companies working
[SPEAKER_00]: on that, companies like Certified Kine or
Clean Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are attempting to unify the industry
under a single broad marketing term
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to OMRI or any other certification
agency so that consumers can be educated
[SPEAKER_00]: and know that when they are purchasing a
product, it's been tested by an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent agency and is safe for them so
they know that they'll get safe medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, we don't even know all the
long-term consequences of what combusting
[SPEAKER_00]: or metabolizing a lot of these chemicals
really are or what levels may exist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: final product, especially with a lot of
the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a responsibility that we have
as growers to provide safe medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: also for recreational use when people are
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, not all product
manufacturers have been totally honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably remember Guardian
Mite Spray, which contained abamectin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they told us it was 100% natural and
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost used it on my crop because I was
using standard samples and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunately never got around to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was highly effective because it had the
same active components as avid,
[SPEAKER_00]: something not approved for use on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other products such as Bushmaster and
Gravity and Flower Dragon, they contain
[SPEAKER_00]: packlobutrazol, plant growth hormones that
made the buds much heavier and denser so
[SPEAKER_00]: they had more weight and more package
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not approved for use on cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest reasons I think going
organic makes sense is it gives you the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to reuse and recycle your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is huge because you no longer have
the cost of moving soil in and out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility if you have an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the cost of buying new soil
every cycle or every other cycle or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of disposing of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge advantages to recycling and reusing
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first question I hear when
typically brought up or the first concern
[SPEAKER_00]: is bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with bugs if you're
reusing and recycling soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had organic growers in soil
for more than two years that have had to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with everything from broad mites,
the russet mite, it's a root aphid,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, the two-spotted spider
mites, fungus gnats, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I firmly believe with an effective IPM
program and preventative maintenance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can totally keep these bugs under
control and manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say organics, I don't mean that
we're just choosing to live in harmony
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of these insects, but we're
actually actively and preventively
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still access and use scientific
method and a lot of these properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that organics means we just
chuck science or chuck cleanliness out the
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case at all or not what I'm
advocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does reuse soil really look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photo that one of our growers
took.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil is over two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grower was averaging 1.6 to 1.8
pounds per light or about 35 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot, single-ended fixtures,
no CO2 supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that entire bed down the road cost me
about $50 in nutrients and media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that media has been sitting there for
over two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is really quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally pull the plant out of the
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake off whatever soil is around the
roots and then harvest your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll bring in every time you
harvest the plant, you're pulling out
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter and you're pulling out
nutrients and those need to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you can literally add some
more, some high quality compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: about a cubic foot per yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found is a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then add some of those dry nutrients
back into the soil, mix it back in and 24
[SPEAKER_00]: to 36 hours, you're bringing in your next
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some photos for some other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all of the soil in the photos I'm
showing you are all these buds were grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil that's over two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Fire Farms down in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you decide that organics is
not the way to go, I hope that you'll at
[SPEAKER_00]: least be open-minded to considering
looking outside of your local hydro shop
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an article that was published in
December of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A company called Outco hired this woman,
Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is coming from the horticulture
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought her in and she was able to
switch them from a conventional bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient program to ingredients that she
found and was aware of just from the hort
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that had similar MPK values,
dropped their cost 22 times over what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were paying before.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, your expenses are
just as important as your sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from an organic perspective,
it's even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that by recycling and reusing the
soil, we've gotten on an average yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: about four pounds per yard or two pounds
per light, which is what most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: growers with CO2 and double ended fixtures
are averaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing about five cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that includes your substrate and your
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the following year, you're down
to under two cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any other program that
can get that low in terms of your costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold Leaf Gardens is a great example of
this type of growing strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're known for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that really struck me was a
group of people came up to our booth
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier this week and I was talking to
them and they recognized the Gold Leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens video we had playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was asking them, what do you think
of their product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been to a lot of rec shops
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first word she used to describe
them was it's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really, really
important when we talk about top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and top shelf cannabis brands is
that ability to produce a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: product over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is of high quality and organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make the material for layer of
canagars, another connoisseur branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is coming out of organic soil
and grown by Gold Leaf, all the material
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their facility, they're using modified
fabric raised beds, about a third of a
[SPEAKER_00]: yard per bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're averaging two to three pounds
across all their strains, or about 60
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of their yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are using double-ended Gavitas and
they are supplementing with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what our goal here is from an
organic perspective is to create a living
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology and recreate nature to the best of
our ability in these facilities and in
[SPEAKER_00]: these beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does require a certain amount of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're going with raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice buffer and allows you to get
more nutrients into the soil rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: having to add nutrients constantly
throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do supplement with things like
molasses and compost teas and other ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit about that here
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can assume that there is benefit
to considering growing organically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next thing that becomes really
important is getting good biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial diversity in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a photo of cyanobacteria actually
creating soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these microorganisms, the bacteria
and fungi that bond the soil together and
[SPEAKER_00]: create that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really important from a plant
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, an important distinction when we're
applying mineral salts is we're directly
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding the plant ionic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we put out organic fertilizer,
we're not directly feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're feeding all of these microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bacteria, archaea, fungal
hyphae, protozoa, flagellates,
[SPEAKER_00]: ciliates, amoeba, all those microorganisms
that you may have studied back in junior
[SPEAKER_00]: high biology class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to that, the plant is
photosynthesizing sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's putting up to 40% of that energy
back out through the soil in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's things like sugars,
carbon, carbohydrates, to feed these
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those microbial communities are then
cycling the nutrients and making the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant actually controls this
too, so if it wants more phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_00]: more potassium, it can actually control
that process by putting out exudates that
[SPEAKER_00]: select for the microorganisms that make
these nutrients plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a natural system, this is the way
that the plant receives nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you another perspective on
this, another visual, this is a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of our potting soil with a little
bit of distilled water and molasses just
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you what these microorganisms
really look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing here, this is all
fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all bacteria running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bacteria then are eating up the
organic matter and in turn being eaten by
[SPEAKER_00]: other bacteria and by larger
microorganisms like flagellates,
[SPEAKER_00]: ciliates, amoeba and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what they excrete is now a plant
available nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put out excess amounts of
mineral salts or chemicals, what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is we're destroying some of these
microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with that is that this is
also what helps defend the plant and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it safe from a lot of the diseases that we
face, especially in facilities and indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's not a lot of microbial
products that I really think are essential
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing cannabis, but mycorrhizal fungi
is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people by now are familiar with
mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a microorganism that's been around
for more than 450 million years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we weren't even aware of it until,
I don't know, maybe 30 or 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms a symbiotic relationship with
the roots of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the primary ways in the
natural system the plant receives
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by infecting the plants, it actually
provides it with protection from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It outcompetes certain other pathogenic
microorganisms like phytophthora and
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizoctonium and fusarium for limited
nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about mycorrhizal fungus,
it's really, really important to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that the ones that associate with cannabis
are known as glomus species, or
[SPEAKER_00]: endomycorrhiza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, glomus interatices and
glomus mossier are the two that associate
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis that are known to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I put this slide up here is
because they've recently been
[SPEAKER_00]: reclassified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can now be called rhizophagus
interatices or rhizophagus irregularis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glomus mossier is now being called
funnelformous mossier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really important, so when you're
looking at a package, this is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to look for is one of the these five
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to being one of the
primary ways a plant receives phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: in the natural system, they've also found
that mycorrhizal fungus can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption up to 40 times more for
nitrogen, sulfur, boron, copper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains cytokinins, jasmonic
acids, and salicylic acids, and oxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cytokinins are really important for
root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasmonic and salicylic acid helps with the
plant's natural defense system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxins are really important in many
different aspects of cellular development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it serves a myriad of functions beyond
just providing phosphorus or nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we use mycorrhizal fungus
appropriately in our gardening practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really a one-time application
to the roots directly when transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted clones or seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that it comes in
direct contact with the roots because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a root symbiont.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, I choose not to add it to
compost teas or with other microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: because it may just become a very
expensive food source for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like to add it in on top of
the soil, too, because it actually needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in contact with the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis cultivation, it's really
simple and easy to add it in right when we
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a tree or an existing bush,
you could dig down and do a root
[SPEAKER_00]: injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I've talked about so far is
really nutrient cycling, or it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: known as the microbial loop in scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of the biological aspects
associated with cannabis and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to talk about now is a
little bit more about the minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients associated with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, I want to tell you about
this gentleman here.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the founder of Territorial Seeds,
and he's written a couple pretty famous
[SPEAKER_00]: books for our region, including Gardening
West of the Cascades, and more recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: a book called The Intelligent Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve's life is actually really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1978, he moved to Oregon and began
homesteading off his land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1979, he opened Territorial
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was doing everything you were
taught at the time when it came to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was using animal manures and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was adding dolomites to sweeten the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we're taught is important
from an organic grower perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he found that his energy level over
the next few years was deteriorating
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: His teeth were starting to fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: His gums were getting soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dentist called them wobblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife's fingernails were actually
becoming soft and pliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he couldn't figure out what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over half his diet was stuff that he was
growing himself right there on his land,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily vegetable-based, and doing
everything he could to be a good organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, over this time period, he decided in
1984 to take a vacation with his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business was finally up and running,
and they were able to take a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sabbatical with his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they left and went to Fiji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they lived for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the period of the next few
months, he found that his health was
[SPEAKER_00]: improving dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: His energy was recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: His teeth, his gums were firming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his wife's fingernails were getting
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't sure if it was the lifestyle,
the wonderful weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: He decided to look further into where the
vegetables were actually being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found that there was this valley
where they were spraying all manner of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical pesticides, but they weren't
using any fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on this diet that his health
was rapidly improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he found out that this particular
valley would flood periodically by
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclones that would come into the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would deposit at that time a
bunch of silt and clay from a local
[SPEAKER_00]: igneous rock deposit where an extinct
volcano used to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the weeds would grow up to chest
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would then be tilled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would plant the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter was coming from the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were spraying all types of
terrible pesticides on this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet his health was improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he then went back to Oregon and found
his health declining again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started reading the works of William
Albrecht that were actually published back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1920s and 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information has been around for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All around the idea of mineral balancing
and nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to William Albrecht,
people like Kerry Reams, Michael Listerra,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neil Kinsey, and many more have done a lot
of research on this on optimal levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals and nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to equate some of these
chemical nutrients with the idea of eating
[SPEAKER_00]: a Big Mac every single day for every meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yes, it contains protein,
fats, and carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll probably be more exposed to
disease and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your health will probably suffer in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that they found with this is
by doing a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this soil test cost $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to use Logan Labs just because it
gives us consistency across comparing all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give us a lot of information,
including pH, CEC, calcium levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these other trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, only $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't take this as the end all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives us a rough guideline of
where our soil is at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by having an idea of what sorts of
excesses and deficiencies exist in our
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, we're then able to re-amend them
and improve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're used to buying,
say, a commercial potting soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a $25 soil test on that potting
soil, finding out if there's anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to improve upon it before planting
your plants could have a dramatic effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on your overall crop health.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example I like to give is organic
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you can find at
your local feed store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs around $22 to $25 for a 40 to 50
pound bag of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains a small amount of fast-release
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent microbial food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to increase all that
bacteria and fungi when you apply it,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stuff that we showed in that other
photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also contains triacontinol,
which is a really important plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone associated with bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for cannabis, it has a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rose growers swear by alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear them talking about how they
add it into their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp meal is another one that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're picking up a small amount of
nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also contains over 70 different
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science has discovered that plants need a
minimum of 14 to 16 elements to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, we've discovered that beyond
that, research has found that there's many
[SPEAKER_00]: more elements in the soil that plants are
able to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking parts per million to
parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having something that adds like a
rock dust or kelp meal that has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace minerals in them, it allows
the plant to access these over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kelp also contains a lot of really
good plant growth hormones and regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like cytokinins, gibberellins,
oxins, some of the things we mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a variety of nitrogen
sources that I made up the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea, there's so many
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are all things that you can
source probably locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish meal, for example, is around 10%
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fast release source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa is 1 to 2% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem seed and feather meal are slow
release nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get that nitrogen over a period
of months rather than a period of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal manures, cottonseed, and compost
and vermicompost contains nitrogen as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, you have fish bone meal,
bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft rock phosphate contains calcium and
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guanose, manures, and fish hydrolysate
that's been stabilized with phosphoric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, all great ways to pick up
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium, I found that cannabis really,
really likes potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to give plants a larger
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see, I think, a lot of PK
boosters in the industry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like kelp meal, seaweed extract
powder is quite high in potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not organic, but potassium
sulfate and potassium silicate are other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost, green sand, cameg, and,
again, alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing direction a little bit,
the next thing I'd like to suggest is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as growers, we start taking a hard look at
ingredient lists and seeing what's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time I hear from a particular
manufacturing company that something is
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary, to me, that means it's not
something I necessarily choose to use on
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know everything that's going
both in my soil and in my crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just for health reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there may be some potential
liabilities down the road, as we discussed
[SPEAKER_00]: with some other manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to know that we're growing
safe crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that means also, potentially,
that they're really doing something like
[SPEAKER_00]: using a lot of these ingredients here that
we could source somewhere else much more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start comparing apples to apples,
which is really, really tough to do when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to a lot of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many companies have mycorrhizal fungi
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we compare them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we already discussed how glomus
interactices and glomus mossier are the
[SPEAKER_00]: two that infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good starting point right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumpkin Pro is a new one out, but from the
giant pumpkin industry, from a former
[SPEAKER_00]: world record holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 300 spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't contain trichoderma and five
pounds around $60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, trichoderma and high phosphorus have
been found to inhibit mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at great white here,
219,000 propagules of mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really good on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 83 propagules per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, of the glomus species that
associate with cannabis, a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: propagules up here are ectomycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they typically associate with conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was talking with some people
yesterday about this, and there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: some benefit to having ectomycorrhizal
fungus in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we talk about mycorrhizal
infection or colonization, we really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the ones that are going to
infect cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight ounces is going to run you
around $72.
[SPEAKER_00]: MycoMaximum here, you're looking at 27
spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pound is $52.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this product from HydroOrganics I
grabbed was 2.46 propagules per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see in the garden industry, I'll see
companies will put with mycorrhizal on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label, on their fertilizer label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go back and flip it over and
look on the other side, it'll be .08
[SPEAKER_00]: spores per cc or spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough to actually get mycorrhizal
infection, but enough for them to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the label to where the ignorant
gardener will think that they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: this in addition to everything else in the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, looking at the label
isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that the Oregon Department
of Agriculture did microbial testing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these products in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I share this, I just want to
say that I'm not here to promote or
[SPEAKER_00]: condone any of these products or say
anything negative about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the research that the Oregon
Department of Ag came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found with the Advanced Nutrients
product, Parana, they were claiming 234
[SPEAKER_00]: propagules per gram of mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was none detected on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Trichoderma and Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG BioWAR here, they claimed 500 spores
per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one spore per gram was found in the
sample that they tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGT Organic Bounty, Great White claimed
365.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only found 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTI claimed 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santiam Organics and Southern Oregon
Bokashi, a million CFUs per gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only found 43 CFUs per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it's the shelf life of
these products and they were sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf too long or if they weren't,
you know, hitting their guaranteed
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis for another reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're paying a lot of money for these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a lot of any of these
things, it might be worth doing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: independent testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's any product that you're
using a lot of, go ahead and spend a few
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks, get some microbial testing on it
and make sure you're actually getting what
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you're getting when you're
buying that product off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from that Pumpkin Pro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted this on his website and it's one
of the reasons I like to talk and promote
[SPEAKER_00]: him, is he has this testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's from December 7th,
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's actually in his product,
it was tested independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I expect from manufacturers
that are selling microbial products,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they're doing this testing for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's perfectly reasonable to
ask and request independent lab testing on
[SPEAKER_00]: products like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just look at a couple other
products to give you some other
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons on costs and value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Strapped by Botanicare is black
strapped molasses, unsulfured black
[SPEAKER_00]: strapped molasses, $45.95 for a two and a
half gallon retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud Candy from Advanced Nutrients,
$169.98 for a two and a half gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know at our feed store, this is our
prices, depending on where you live,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be able to find it even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell a three and a half gallon bucket
for $27 and a 50 gallon drum for $225.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sourcing it out of the egg industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are things that if you choose
to use them in your gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may just want to start looking other
places and see where you can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaweed, another great thing, like we
already talked about all the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all cold water processed,
Ascophylum nidosum, which is North
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlantic sea kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices range from $56, $55, $56 up to $62
a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy your own seaweed extract
powder for $15 to $20 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost you about 20 cents per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying in bulk, like a 44 pound
box, you can get that price down to around
[SPEAKER_00]: $8 a pound, which cuts you down to like
five to 10 cents a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason you can't mix your own seaweed
with water, make your own product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're literally only using a quarter
teaspoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemic Acids, wonderful chelators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bond with the minerals in our soil
and help make them plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond Black is 6% by content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Organics, .1% by content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carry one by Terra Vita.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around $12 to $15 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% by content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own for three and a half
cents a gallon or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioEgg is another company that has really
good Chemic Acids that are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take a look around and make sure
you're looking at the labels to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages are on there and what you're
actually getting for your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last point that I think is really,
really important is have a test garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will more than pay for itself over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I meet
growers and they came up to me and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, you've got to try this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product X will be this amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got 20% more growth over
their crop before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked them, well, did you have any
controls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did you change the humidity in the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you change your watering practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, but we switched lighting companies
that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I know if it was product X or
the lighting or some other thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they may do five different nutrient
samples that they picked up at a trade
[SPEAKER_00]: show like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't know which of the five
actually had benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe four of the five actually were
detrimental for your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fifth one was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to know if you don't have
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you have to be able to
replicate this experiment over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again and only change one thing in your
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're setting up a test garden,
that means that one section, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean just one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have maybe 10 to 15 plants or
an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would receive one change from the rest of
your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your control can be how you normally
grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your test garden can be whatever
new idea or new thing you want to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these principles I mentioned
today, those are things you can test out
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to see if it works for you in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dedicate just a small portion of
your garden to trying some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, really, really important that
we use scientific method, experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: design, and have controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what our variables are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in terms of whether or not this
process works, companies like Gold Leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens here in Washington has an amazing
brand going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're known for their high quality
cannabis products and top shelf flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get top dollar for what they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi-Fi Farms and Fire down in Oregon are
two really progressive, sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmentally friendly brands that
are doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also getting that top dollar in
the market because people know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to keep their production
levels at optimal levels because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating a lot of these principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some photos,
extra photos I have from Fire that they
[SPEAKER_00]: shared with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these were grown organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to sum it up, these are sort of
the main points of what I wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: across to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please consider growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, increase the microbial
diversity and biomass in your soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means using high quality compost or
vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about $20 municipal
compost that you get in your local garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invest in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what your nutrient levels and mineral
levels are in your soil so you can adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: them and make them optimal for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your local garden and farm store
and find out what they have, your local
[SPEAKER_00]: egg supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to save tons of money on a
lot of these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these raw amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at the ingredients on the
labels so you can start comparing and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what you're actually paying money
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, try these things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a test garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try one thing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're constantly learning and evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by working together, we can all share
that knowledge and improve a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I had today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they do have some sort of
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue there is that certification has
to have value, which means enough people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry have to be aware of what
that certification means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other challenge there is not all
of these certifiers are requiring the same
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are right that yes, there are
certification agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Clean Green and Certified Cannabis are
the two largest right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that one of them will gain
enough momentum and do enough marketing to
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can really control the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can start like Omri would be a
great example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Omri is just an independent certification
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not associated with the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people recognize Omri.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consumers, growers, give it a
perceived value that allows manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a little bit more money for that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers know that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, with cannabis, it will be
the same thing, where if you go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: store and see an area that's certified
kind products or Clean Green certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: that consumer will be willing to pay an
extra 20%, say, for that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the back end, the growers could get
10 to 20% more for the value of that
[SPEAKER_00]: product by being certified.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question about resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about a lot of different elements
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use some of your instruments and some of
these products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that available online on your website?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are there resources that you might
point folks to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I posted a written transcript of my
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be live at 11 of what I was
going to talk about in this talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had a lot of those resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it'll be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to add the slides down the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have some of those visuals as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides you, are there other publicly
available resources in the Department of
[SPEAKER_05]: Agriculture?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Oregon Department of Agriculture
has a wonderful website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the links to that in my talk as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I do recommend that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ODA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have a cannabis section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a pesticide advisory
section as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, I also run a forum
with Tim Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no advertising on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's logicalgardener.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all primarily science-based
horticulture, covering a variety of topics
[SPEAKER_00]: from permaculture to gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily cannabis-focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a medicinal plants section
where there is talk on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that URL?
[SPEAKER_00]: Logicalgardener.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the link section on our
website, too, if you go to kissorganics
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and gave a talk on compost teas on
Kauai about a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that I was totally out of my
element because the environment was so
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of these principles are
still very sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of soil structure and all the
composition, all of that, I could look at
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil test and maybe give you analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not as familiar with those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be good to connect with
someone locally, a local farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that's been growing in those
soils that could give you more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about contracting
[SPEAKER_03]: the family as part of the paddocks
[SPEAKER_03]: and sun and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, we've got challenges.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found even in Seattle, having a shade
cloth over our tomatoes, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our greenhouse made a huge difference
in controlling the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't see any reduction in growth
rate over the tomatoes in terms of the UV
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure from the other tomatoes in our
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't anything that was terribly
scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would tour some tomato greenhouses
and see how they're controlling,
[SPEAKER_00]: or pepper greenhouse, how they're
controlling temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really your best resource,
I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it depends on what stage of plant
growth you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think keeping a clean room in those
protocols are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then having a preventative bug
program, which I know you guys do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a combination of initially
doing some spraying, some foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: applications with horticultural oils to
control and maybe knock down the bug
[SPEAKER_00]: population and bringing in some
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may find, I think, with organics
that the plant does have other microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions that will help potentially
with plant defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that growing organically
makes all these pathogens go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you're still dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you can consider still reusing
soil in facilities, even when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with a lot of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have had growers that have had
everything under the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we haven't found a solution
for yet, to be totally honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this root nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it got a hold in this one garden,
we were not able to eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to throw out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that soil was about four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower was willing to do that,
because they'd still gotten their ROI on
[SPEAKER_00]: it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the best thing is don't take in
new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I hear,
oh, yeah, I got these from a buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have, you name it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So asking if taking in organic soil can be
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole other vector for bringing in
insects and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that you will have to deal
with with organic soils is fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unavoidable any time you have that
amount of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are, fortunately, really easy to
treat and control relative to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important that wherever you're
getting your soil, or if you're mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: your own soil, that it's coming from a
clean facility or a clean place to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not bringing in any of these pests
and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another potential vector,
just like anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you recommend to use some kind of
tea as a spray to prevent diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are some people that are
foliar feeding with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use them as soil drenches to
increase nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mixed data and research in regards
to using them for disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I choose not to mention it for that,
because it also brings up the whole issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of claiming that these teas are
pesticidal, which brings in the EPA and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worth experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one issue with a lot of these teas,
too, though, is that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the same compost
tea every time you brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you can change those
microbial communities quite a bit just by
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting how long you're brewing or what
your food source is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some studies that show that
seaweed has actually helped, has contained
[SPEAKER_00]: some pesticidal properties in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be something you want to
experiment with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, tell us what booth you're in
and where folks can come find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know our exact booth number.
[SPEAKER_00]: 739.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set me up for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Tad, for a very informative
presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, dude.
Thank you.
