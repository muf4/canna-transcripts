[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I water my plants, I think
about root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pull a healthy plant out of a pot
or out of the ground and you see those
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny fuzzy white strands coming out of the
root, those are your root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs are lateral extensions of a
single cell and the primary source of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs are the main interface with the
rhizosphere, the area around the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: where interactions with microbes and soil
minerals occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why root hairs every time I water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not really thinking about root
hairs so much as I am about root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now root hairs have a limited lifespan and
plants are constantly generating new ones
[SPEAKER_00]: as old ones die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also things that we do as
growers that kill root hairs, effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting water and nutrient uptake to our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stressful conditions like extreme soil
temperatures, nutrient deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicities and watering play a key role in
root hair health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's why I think about it when I'm
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: My botany professor, Don Marshall,
used to say that over watering and under
[SPEAKER_00]: watering cause the same above ground
symptoms in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot tell if a plant has been
over or under watered simply by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because both over and under watering cause
root hair death and the plant is not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to uptake nutrients and water as
efficiently until those root hairs regrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the why or the mechanism
behind what we do as growers can be useful
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve our ability to grow healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time you're watering, I encourage
you to think about root hairs and root
[SPEAKER_00]: hair death and the role you play in your
plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
See you next time.
