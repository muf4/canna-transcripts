Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.

[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Kurt Becker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kurt is the executive vice president of
commercial products for the DRAM
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone looking to improve the efficacy
of their spray applications, I highly
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest checking out this podcast and
reaching out to DRAM directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hear Kurt speak at a biocontrols
conference last year, and he is a genius
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to spray applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past 23 years, Kurt has worked
with growers to improve their spray and
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation practices through improved
technology and technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM, now in its 76th year, is a leader in
horticultural technology focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, chemical application,
air movement, and water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Kurt, welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, can we start out giving listeners a
little bit of a background into your
[SPEAKER_01]: history and how you came into this role
and all this knowledge regarding spray
[SPEAKER_01]: applications?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of that is on the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied political science in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked in banking before I got into the
horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for 24 and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a sales role took me into the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those 24 years, I've been very active
in developing a lot of our product line on
[SPEAKER_02]: the spray side, as well as a lot of our
philosophies and working on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: science behind what we do from a spray
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over that timeframe, DRAM has really
focused on different particle sizes doing
[SPEAKER_02]: different things and making sure that we
know how to make a different sized
[SPEAKER_02]: droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trick is knowing how to make that
applicable to plant protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've developed a number of different
tools over that timeframe during my tenure
[SPEAKER_02]: at the company that basically focus on,
okay, we want to try and achieve this,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we make a droplet that does that,
or we need this much force to get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of things that basically all of
our different equipment is designed to do
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why I think we make over 37 different
machines for indoor plant protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really make equipment for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our stuff could be used that way,
but the majority of what we've done and
[SPEAKER_02]: where we focus is for indoor plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you say indoor, you're talking
about greenhouse environments as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's where we start.
[SPEAKER_02]: DRAM is a 77-year-old company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been involved in the greenhouse
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor meaning you got walls and you got a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really different characteristics
of a spray that you require, and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: different concerns that you might have
when you're spraying outside versus
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of outdoor spray equipment tends to
use bigger droplets, tends to be wetter
[SPEAKER_02]: applications unless we really bring in
aerial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to do that because there's a lot
of concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is drift management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to spray the neighbor's
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to have stuff drifting into
different crops that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply a pesticide to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor, it's very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really worried about intrusion
into other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to use a much wider range of
droplet sizes to achieve better coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look outside aerially, aerial
applications work very well in very wide
[SPEAKER_02]: open spaces where you've got the same crop
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody can use an aerial application,
which is using generally smaller droplets,
[SPEAKER_02]: although still much larger than some of
the stuff that we can create for indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent there is that they can cover a
lot greater area quicker, but they also do
[SPEAKER_02]: it with a lot less liquid because you
can't carry a tanker load full of liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plane that you'd be using to apply
the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our instance, I'm not really worried
about the amount of water that we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to apply from a transferring it and
carrying it standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more about using smaller droplets and
then we just need less water to do the job
[SPEAKER_02]: because we can cover much more surface
area the smaller droplets we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about droplet size and how
it affects an application.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm hearing is that the smaller the
droplet size, the better surface area,
[SPEAKER_01]: better coverage you get over that leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other considerations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much that's the important fact to
pull out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's not necessarily a linear
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually exponential.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we cut particle size, we cut droplets
down into smaller sizes, we cover a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more surface area because they themselves
have more surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pretty common graphic that we like to
use in communicating that is just
[SPEAKER_02]: explaining that if we took one 100 micron
droplet, the liquid contained in 100
[SPEAKER_02]: micron droplet, and 100 micron is already
pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the size of your hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: The diameter of your hair is about 100
microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we took one droplet that was 100
microns and we cut in that same amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid, we took that same amount of liquid
and made droplets that were 50 microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the same fluid volume, we would get
eight droplets that would be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: volume of liquid, but we would be able to
cover more surface area because you have
[SPEAKER_02]: eight droplets just by cutting the
particle size in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we take that and we cut it to a tenth
of the original size or about 10 microns,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get about a thousand droplets with the
same liquid contained in the 100 micron
[SPEAKER_02]: droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we can cover much more surface
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about majority of what we're
using to spray plants is water-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are oil-based products, very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, those are never used without
something else, without being dissolved in
[SPEAKER_02]: something, which is typically water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about water, water has a
very, very strong surface tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to beat up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can chemically alter that using
surfactants and things like that to help
[SPEAKER_02]: it spread more evenly, but oil has a very
low surface tension, so it spreads very
[SPEAKER_02]: evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's a good lubricant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spreads out over surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about what we're doing,
we're basically doing the same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanically that a surfactant might do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking that large droplet and we're
making it into a sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spreading it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We happen to be doing it by chopping it up
into tiny little droplets and spreading it
[SPEAKER_02]: more evenly instead of a liquid that
spreads on its own, but the effect is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're covering much more surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we take that same example, the
100-micron droplet, we cut it to a 20th of
[SPEAKER_02]: the size or about 5-micron droplets,
which is something we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get about 19,000 droplets with the same
liquid contained in the one 100-micron
[SPEAKER_02]: droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100-microns is at the very low end of
hydraulic spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of hydraulic sprayers
that put out a droplet with an average
[SPEAKER_02]: particle size that small.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're talking about some of the fog
types, systems that we have, we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: directed fog that is a 50-micron droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got ultra-low volume fogs that are
in the 5- to 10-micron droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cover a lot more surface area,
which is really where that term actually
[SPEAKER_02]: gets its name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low volume and ultra-low volume is really
referring to the amount of liquid that's
[SPEAKER_02]: used to make the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those aren't our terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are industry terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing about that, even when we
talk about hydraulic spraying,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a lot of times when
hydraulic sprays are very applicable and
[SPEAKER_02]: fog is not always the best choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding that relationship of if I
take a droplet and I cut the average
[SPEAKER_02]: particle size in half, I'm going to get
about eight times more droplets with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same liquid in the tank, it basically
illustrates the idea that when we can
[SPEAKER_02]: create smaller droplets, even if we don't
go all the way down the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just cut them in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cover more surface area,
much more effectively than we can with
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a greenhouse or indoor space where
we're not really worried about wind drift,
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminating other crops, we might be
spraying the whole room, using the
[SPEAKER_02]: smallest droplet applicable for that is
generally going to be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so I understand, you're not taking
that 100-micron droplet and cutting it in
[SPEAKER_01]: half in your example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying that if you sprayed a gallon
of 100-micron droplets versus a gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: a gallon of 50-micron droplets,
you're going to get eight times the
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage with that 50-micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure I understood
the math on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me up to my next question,
which was can you use a 100-micron droplet
[SPEAKER_01]: or a sprayer like that with a surfactant
and achieve the same results as you would
[SPEAKER_01]: with a smaller droplet size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily the same results,
but surfactants are always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're safe on the plant
you're going to be applying them to and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're labeled for that plant for the
use, surfactants are generally a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: idea because you're going to cover more
surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to get them there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where smaller droplets tend to
sometimes have an advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also won't ever get to the reduction
in volume that you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about wet spraying or
hydraulic spraying, even if we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about targeted low volume, we're going to
break the world down into hydraulic sprays
[SPEAKER_02]: or the wet sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spraying a gallon, a gallon and a
half a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are going to be visibly wet
after you've done your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the typical hydraulic spray that
people think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about targeted low volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're basically taking down that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're creating droplets in the 50,
40 to 60 micron range typically where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to then use a lot less water,
a higher concentration of product to
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd use similar amounts of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just put it in less liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we would aim that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different types of machines that
we can use to aim that into the crop so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can be selective.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that instance, where I mentioned drift
is generally not a concern indoors in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I don't want to hit the bench
next to the one I'm trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: An ultra-low volume treatment,
when we get into that five and 10 micron
[SPEAKER_02]: range, that is a space treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's flea bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cat comes home with fleas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to bomb the whole house to kill
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what ultra-low volume is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are filling the space with pesticide
and you can't do a bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are doing the entire room at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we want to just treat a bench or a
portion of a bench, targeted low volume
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can use smaller droplets but not
as small as we could go, we can aim that
[SPEAKER_02]: and have it not float away and drift
around the whole house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those droplets tend to fall much quicker
than say, a five to 10 micron droplet
[SPEAKER_02]: which can stay airborne for as much as
three to four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do these smaller droplets affect
humidity then over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: They must raise it quite a bit,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at a typical application,
generally not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those types of nozzles can be used or
nozzles creating similar droplets can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used to affect humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, a fog system.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other types of systems we do besides
spray application, we do moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: management, we do irrigation systems,
we do missing systems for propagation,
[SPEAKER_02]: we do drip irrigation, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have nozzles that will create 80 micron
droplets and there's other companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: have systems that will create with high
pressure that can create 10 to 20 microns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are typically distributed systems
where you have a pipe running and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: nozzles all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of those nozzles is going to
maybe put out three to five liters per
[SPEAKER_02]: hour of liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at what we do, we're going to
do a similar output but we're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that with one nozzle and we're going to do
that from one location to try and spread
[SPEAKER_02]: the pesticide around.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we used more volume or if we continued
that operation, through a long period,
[SPEAKER_02]: we could increase the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, if I say I take a 10,000 square
foot space, we're generally not adding
[SPEAKER_02]: more than two liters of liquid to that or
half a gallon when we're doing a pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's generally not affecting humidity
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you think about it, if you
compare that to something like a wet
[SPEAKER_02]: spray, if I'm going to put two liters into
that space but with a wet spray you might
[SPEAKER_02]: put 50 gallons or 30 gallons in that same
space, that amount of moisture is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: generally more detrimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can cause more humidity issues than say
the low volume application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually having less of an effect
on humidity than a spray where you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: put out more liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what you're saying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, generally, that's the case,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I forget, you mentioned
surfactants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For organic growers or gardeners,
do you have any recommendations for
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites that you've seen just over the
years that people are using?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, there's a lot fewer than most
of the ones that are organically approved
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be yucca-based extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of them are saponin-based
versions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saponin is a chemistry chemical in certain
plants that basically it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerin-based surfactant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saponin is an active ingredient in a
number of different organically registered
[SPEAKER_02]: products that are applicable for organic
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as specific brands, there's not any
of them that I would necessarily recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: over another because they're all fairly
similar in the way that they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're normally yucca-based, but there
are some other bases of saponin that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, those tend to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple that we've done some
tests with regards specifically to one
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of equipment we make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned the ultra-low volume range.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really create droplets in very
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have different methods to make smaller
droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use high pressure hydrostatic
pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use aerosol generation systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we're using air in a very
precise manner to chop the droplets up,
[SPEAKER_02]: shear the droplets, and apply them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have volume-based air systems
where we use high velocity and volumes of
[SPEAKER_02]: air to shatter the droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those latter systems tend to be a little
bit more sloppy in the way that they
[SPEAKER_02]: create a droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as accurate as far as how
evenly they'll break up the droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those cases, we typically require some
type of surfactant to help with that
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: In non-organic agriculture, we are using a
product of our own design, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: OMRI approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not organically approvable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's a salt-based product.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those instances, we can use some of the
saponin-based products to help that
[SPEAKER_02]: machine do its job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you reduce the surface tension
of the water so that as we shatter it with
[SPEAKER_02]: that velocity and volume of air,
we're able to shatter the droplets more
[SPEAKER_02]: evenly and get a much better result as far
as distribution through the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who is a grower gardener that
has a greenhouse or an indoor garden where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're cultivating, what sort of
practical considerations in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: actual sprayers would you recommend for
them to have on hand in a given situation
[SPEAKER_01]: like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned having a way of applying to
the entire space, which seems really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would they also need to have one for
targeted spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could recommend specific sprayers,
I think that would be useful too.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said before, the low-volume stuff is
a great time saver, great labor saver,
[SPEAKER_02]: generally does a really good job of
applying pesticides, but it's not always
[SPEAKER_02]: applicable.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at someone, say you're just
starting out looking for a new piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment and you've got a greenhouse area
that you want to spray, we generally start
[SPEAKER_02]: with a good hydraulic sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to see machines run up to at least
500 PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make a number of machines, our Hydra
and our MSO line both run up to 500 PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we like to make sure that one of the
things we see in greenhouses quite often
[SPEAKER_02]: is someone might have a machine capable of
500 PSI, but they turn it up to 250 or
[SPEAKER_02]: 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: The machines are meant to work at higher
pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason why you may want to
reduce pressure for some specific
[SPEAKER_02]: applications, but for the most part,
if you're trying to apply a pesticide,
[SPEAKER_02]: a fungicide to the plant and you're not
worried about things like drifting onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the next crop or you're just generally not
going to damage the plant by increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: the pressure because the nozzle is
generally taking care of that by helping
[SPEAKER_02]: you manufacture a smaller droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you've got a nozzle that's
putting out two plus gallons a minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: higher pressure can be a problem,
but nozzles that are meant for fine
[SPEAKER_02]: application, which anything that we would
sell would come standardly with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher the pressure generally means
the finer the droplets were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: create.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we also get the added benefit of
more force.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're trying to apply pesticides to a
plant, a lot of the things we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: target aren't sitting on the outside of
the leaves and they aren't sitting at the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of the apical growth or anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not an easy spot to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally hiding inside the plant
and they do that because it's the safest
[SPEAKER_02]: place for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we want to get white fly or spider mite
or somebody that's up underneath,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to target mildew or botrytis at
the stem or things that we have to really
[SPEAKER_02]: get into the canopy, droplets going to
help, but also some force.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need something to actually propel that
product into the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a higher pressure,
it's actually giving you a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: force to push that spray into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we don't want force like a pressure
washer force.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want something that's very hard,
straight stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want force with very fine droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up with a very swirling spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up with very diffuse droplets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The force is there, but it rapidly
dissipates when it encounters other forces
[SPEAKER_02]: like a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll hit that plant and spread as opposed
to battering the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A combination there, looking at particle
size and pressure, you want to always make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure you have the right nozzle and married
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd start with something that's a good up
to 500 PSI sprayer, but as I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's times when you may want to reduce
that pressure, so variable pressure is
[SPEAKER_02]: important when you're looking at a
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure you can turn down
the pressure because sometimes you may
[SPEAKER_02]: want to spray just a little section and
you don't want it drifting onto something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of different products that
we use commercially, plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators, where I want that on a
specific set of plants and I don't want it
[SPEAKER_02]: drifting all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's sometimes when I might need to
sprench the soil or just get the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly moist and fine droplets don't
help me with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a little bit coarser of a droplet
so it'll actually impact the soil and soak
[SPEAKER_02]: in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressure can, altering your pressure can
help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variability is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at then things like, the next
thing that I would suggest that's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the next most important besides a good
solid pressurized system is usability and
[SPEAKER_02]: ease of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to go and spray a greenhouse
and take time doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a real fun job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's a lot of people that
say that's something that they really
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a job that's a necessary thing,
but it's not anybody's favorite job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our belief as a company is we want to make
it as easy as possible for the applicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: The harder it gets for the applicator,
the worse job they do in our opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got to run back to the machine
because the hose keeps getting caught and
[SPEAKER_02]: pinched against the sidewall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is a real bear to move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 gallons, we've got a lot of machines
that are 50, 100, even 200 gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has to move that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be very, very easy to maneuver
because 50 gallons is 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving that, it's important to make sure
that it's designed well to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: maneuver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've selected the right wheels for the
type of surface you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: covering with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the right kind of reel that
doesn't create a pinch point so you're 20
[SPEAKER_02]: feet out and the hose gets pinched up
against the sidewall and you've got to run
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the machine to undo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to look for guns that are
comfortable to hold when you're pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: the trigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some guns that are out there where
you basically, they're like an exercise,
[SPEAKER_02]: like one of those sprayers that they used
to have in the 80s for building up your
[SPEAKER_02]: forearms and your grip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a very tight spring and so when
you pull the trigger, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: force involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to find things that are more
comfortable to use because if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable doing the job and you're
constantly having to deal with issues
[SPEAKER_02]: around the equipment, generally the job
suffers, is our opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spend a lot of our time designing for
ease of use and comfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at hydraulic sprayers,
any of our equipment is going to fit into
[SPEAKER_02]: those types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that they're easy to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure they've got a good
range of pressure but also that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: get up to about 500 PSI to create a fine
droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then beyond that, as long as those types
of things are covered, I think you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start out just great.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, that's when we start to talk
to people about maybe you want to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about a low-volume machine to cut some of
the time that you're putting into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're starting out, a good hydraulic
sprayer is the best place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought me to my next question
because the moment you said smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: droplets, I immediately thought of compost
tea applications or microbial-based
[SPEAKER_01]: applications where, in my experience,
a smaller droplet can sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: in higher force, can lead to actually
being quite damaging to microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch a little bit on options in
that regard and your experiences and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're finding?
[SPEAKER_02]: To an extent, that can be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the manufacturer's
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certainly some products,
whether they're compost teas or microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: products, where you are applying,
say, an entomopathic fungi that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: parasitize a white fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to be aware of the limitations
of those microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that certain pressures can cause
damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be very well aware that other
things that are going to impact those
[SPEAKER_02]: applications is filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of the sprayers we make has
filters in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's done to protect the system,
protect the nozzle, protect the investment
[SPEAKER_02]: the person has put into that machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, we look at that as
that's one application.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we modify things to make that
application?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be every application.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work very closely with a lot of the
manufacturers of those products and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to apply a Bavaria Baciana
product, we're very familiar with the
[SPEAKER_02]: limitations of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, pressure is not a big
issue for something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but heat is.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those ultra-low volume machines
that we make is actually a small jet
[SPEAKER_02]: engine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is heat that results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've actually developed a specific
version of that machine which cools the
[SPEAKER_02]: exhaust so that we don't have issues and
we can apply those types of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work very hard at making sure that we
understand our equipment in relation to
[SPEAKER_02]: biological applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, we can use any of them
without any real concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, like I said, you might need
micro-modification.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to apply something that we
don't want to filter out all the good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that we sometimes
remove the filter, but then that's with
[SPEAKER_02]: the caveat that you take that filter out,
you better make sure you really rinse the
[SPEAKER_02]: machine and flush it well before you put
it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to use a heat-sensitive
product, making sure that you've got the
[SPEAKER_02]: correct machine to do that job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our team is very well versed in those
types of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good at working.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of biological application
even in non-organic horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those are just very, very good
products to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're safer environmentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a totally different mode of
action than a lot of the other pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: that are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to shake that stuff up even if
you're a conventional grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of our customers are using
those types of products already very
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: My experience with it, is that using a
microscope, we would check the product for
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, like a compost tea, for example,
and then we would send it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer and look at it on the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is just a one-off thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at an atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had a HydroShop once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the bacteria, the motile bacteria,
was killed off by going through this
[SPEAKER_01]: atomizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might have been a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assumed it was the particle size,
the droplet size, or something inside
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be maybe not even a droplet size,
but sometimes it can be just the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: application or the process of making the
droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The droplet might be fairly large,
but the forces involved in doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: might cause some damage to something.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said, the best way to test that
stuff is to actually run a test and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what comes out the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: With most of the commercially available
product, in the horticultural industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've actually done that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with the manufacturers of those
products to get approval with any of those
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the chemical manufacturers actually
is a biological manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of years ago, basically said,
we always need to keep together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always need to work together because
they make the bullets, we make the guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure they fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that our stuff works
with their stuff and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a very close relationship with the
various manufacturers of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time something new comes out,
we're really good about making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets tested and that we understand how
to use those products in our equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower could contact DRAM and find out
from them exactly what sprayer would work
[SPEAKER_01]: best for the types of products that
they're applying in their greenhouse or in
[SPEAKER_01]: their indoor environment, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along those lines, I, yesterday,
was out at a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a 500-gallon compost tea brewer
that they're then sending through a
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosatron out into these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them how I would test it,
similar to what we just discussed,
[SPEAKER_01]: using a microscope, look at the tea
before, look at it after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any results relating to
Dosatrons and how they affect microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: life, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to, specifically,
a compost tea, it's hard to know because
[SPEAKER_02]: there can be such a wide range of
constituent microflora in what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to apply there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to commercially available
products, I don't think there's any issues
[SPEAKER_02]: at all from what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design of the piston in that,
basically, the way that those work,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have water runs through that drives a
piston up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get some issues against the
sidewall of the chamber, but I would think
[SPEAKER_02]: that you wouldn't get very much damage at
all, especially given the size of the
[SPEAKER_02]: population you'd be trying to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that an injector,
generally, would be a fairly safe method,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a piston-based injector like a
Dosatron, just because you're basically
[SPEAKER_02]: siphoning liquid out of a tank with one
pull on the piston, and you're pushing it
[SPEAKER_02]: out with the reverse stroke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a large chance of a chamber
that's being filled each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't think there'd be much of an
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that I could see being an
issue is that Dosatron has a filter on the
[SPEAKER_02]: intake of the solution line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how big the microbial product
is, the different little bugs you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to pull through that machine,
their filter might be trapping and
[SPEAKER_02]: filtering some of them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might need to look at what the filter
does, but I would say the actual mechanics
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't probably be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along those lines, I know we started
talking about microbes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently was sent a test result from a
buddy of mine who's a golf course
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendent.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had started looking at water quality,
specifically chlorine, and how it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial-based products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a pretty big die-off associated
with adding chlorine to a finished
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial product or compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything you would add along
those lines, or any experiences yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our businesses, we have a segment
of our business called DRAM Water,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we do in that segment of our
business is water treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do water management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We move water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pump water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We store water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We develop the irrigation system,
but we also do disinfection of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do filtration of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use chlorine as a disinfectant,
and the main reason we don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorine, well, one, we feel there's more
effective disinfectants for some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things we're trying to do, but at the same
time, chlorine is really not a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant-friendly product, but it's certainly
not a microbial-friendly product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire point of putting chlorine into
your pool is to prevent the spread of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens in that pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want somebody to get in there all
journey and have those little germs
[SPEAKER_02]: swirled over and get somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point of that is to kill those.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're stating as far as the tests
that they did, that completely makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would generally not use chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to use chlorinated water,
let it gas off for a bit, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation, and you'll gas off a lot of the
chlorine in a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you could use things like
carbon filters and stuff to remove the
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorine if you're going to be using city
water and you're concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly wouldn't add it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a disinfectant, we use ozone,
which is from the air we breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically strip the nitrogen out,
we concentrate the oxygen, and we run it
[SPEAKER_02]: through a generation system that basically
is like lightning in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It splits up some of those O2 molecules
and pairs them with other O2 molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: making O3.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very reactive product, which is why
we like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very good at eliminating biofilm and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll nuke anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we took straight, very high-level
ozonated water and we mixed it immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bunch of microbes, it would get rid
of a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing about ozone though is it's
so reactive that typically it tends to,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a non-demand environment, if I've got
nothing I need to oxidize, it's still only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a half-life of 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What ends up happening though,
what's really nice about the ozone system,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when we're talking about using
it with microbial products, most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes we like tend to be aerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the microbes we don't like for
plant growth tend to be anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the real big advantages of an ozone
system for plant growth is that when the
[SPEAKER_02]: ozone goes away, it reverts back to O2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, one of those oxygen molecules
on an O3 molecule split off, oxidizing
[SPEAKER_02]: something, leaving O2.
[SPEAKER_02]: That O2 is still dissolved in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The advantage is we can actually have very
high levels of dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we've actually done some tests using
highly ozonated water that had been run
[SPEAKER_02]: through a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ozone is basically being used up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ending up with very high levels of
dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, in our tests in the 20 to 25
ppm levels of dissolved oxygen,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is at that point with the
temperature water we were using was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually above saturation level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturation was about 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put that in because ozone is much
more soluble in water than O2 is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it into solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays in solution much like carbon
dioxide does in a can of soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a pressurized canister that's
full of super saturated gas in a liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open it up, the pressure is relieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to effervesce and fizz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's happening in this case,
but it doesn't happen in two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens in about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a while for your can of Coke to
go flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've super saturated the liquid with the
water with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we are able to keep that in solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some trials with specifically
Bavaria basiana, as well as some
[SPEAKER_02]: trichoderma products, where we saw better
colonization as a result of using highly
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidated water from the ozone process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly because we're providing them with
an environment that allows them to thrive
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of oxygen in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a roundabout way of answering your
question about chlorine in spray solutions
[SPEAKER_02]: using microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that chlorine is probably not
a good tool to be using in that type of an
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad way to clean up afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you get something in the tank that
maybe shouldn't have been in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it happen where a compost tea
system, something that we didn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: want if the compost wasn't very good or
there was a bad source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fusarium or something in there that
could be bred as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorine would be a good tool to help
clean it up afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you touched on biofilm briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you can talk about a
little bit more in terms of maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: and care of sprayers and irrigation lines
and such things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a very big part of what we
do from a water treatment standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biofilm is a big part of any irrigation
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find it in any water system at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ozone, because it's so reactive,
is actually a very good tool to eliminate
[SPEAKER_02]: biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It generally isn't going to slough it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we see with other
biofilm eradicants is that they'll loosen
[SPEAKER_02]: chunks and send it downstream,
whereas ozone tends to react very quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it stops because you've used the
ozone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it ends up doing instead of weakening
the bond to the pipe, it ends up burning
[SPEAKER_02]: up the ozone or the biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then more ozone comes along and burns up a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically eats its way down the pipe
without really removing it in big snake
[SPEAKER_02]: skins worth of algae and biofilm and gunk
that end up clogging stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the more effective tools that we've
found for controlling biofilm is ozone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's so reactive,
it tends to do a better job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular device or something
like an ozonator that you could put on
[SPEAKER_01]: your irrigation or something that you can
use to run a tap to fill your sprayer with
[SPEAKER_01]: that water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then run that through your sprayer as a
way of ... Because it sounds like a great
[SPEAKER_01]: option to have right on your irrigation to
where you just run it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes out the biofilm and you end up
with high dissolved oxygen water hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I understanding this correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what we feel the benefit
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically doing a lot of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, it's giving you water
that's healthier than it was before,
[SPEAKER_02]: much healthier for plant growth as well as
for beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as a system, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's not really a plug and
play thing because there's so much that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, a system like that is going to
be something we would design for a
[SPEAKER_02]: customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some basic sizes of systems,
but one of the things we like to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: right away is, first, we have to look at
how much water you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water do we need to clean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, we would look at what's in the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need to remove?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that with filtration or disinfection
of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we find that a lot
of people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't always look at what's in the
water to be removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important because if I base my
disinfection system on flow alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've got really, really high loads,
I'm going to overload the system very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly because it's going to be working
really hard to get rid of the very high
[SPEAKER_02]: load, even if it's not a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look at both of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that we do a system like that,
we can come in with some basic
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations just by looking at the
water, but most of the time we want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: a water sample and test the water to see
what's actually there that needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's things that need other
tools to help remove.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're high in salt or bicarbonates or
something like that, ozone is not
[SPEAKER_02]: effective on those types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would look at other types of whether
we're going to adjust the pH or we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to use something like nanofiltration
or even RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would look at different things when
applicable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't necessarily advocate those types
of things all the time because a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times the water in a lot of facilities is
great to start out or it might need just a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of tweaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we see growers that think RO is
some special, really magical water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually what it is, H2O.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hydrogen and oxygen only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has no buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing else, whereas most of the
water on the planet has something else in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much stuff is dissolved in the water
around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of that is benign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what we're trying to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're trying to grow plants,
there's some things we want to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was you I was talking to at the
biocontrols conference that said that RO
[SPEAKER_01]: water is not the best option for growers
that are growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you expand on that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, basically for some of the
reasons that I just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: the main issue that we find with RO is
that there's really very little buffering
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm growing in, for example,
commonly a soil with media, so I'm using
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's fairly inert,
a poop, cocoa, whatever, even rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I keep putting in water there where
I've adjusted it for the pH, but it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: RO'd, or I'm using a fertilizer that's
acidic, it's going to start to drop the
[SPEAKER_02]: media pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got nothing in that water to help
buffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bicarbonate's actually yes, we can have
too many, but a lot of times those
[SPEAKER_02]: bicarbonates are helping us keep that
water fairly stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're applying things like an acidic
fertilizer without those bicarbonates to
[SPEAKER_02]: help buffer that water, we're going to
start crashing the media pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we find that we've seen that in grow
facilities where people have used RO water
[SPEAKER_02]: just indiscriminately and said,
yes, I think I need this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't have anything buffering it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at RO systems, even when we
sell an RO system, we rarely tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: grower to use the RO water by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We generally are going to blend that back
at some ratio to their original source
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is it's going to be easier to
grow with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to steer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've got no buffering capacity,
it's like you can only make right turns in
[SPEAKER_02]: your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come up with a 30 degree angle,
you're not going to be able to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to make a bunch of
right turns back and forth, back and forth
[SPEAKER_02]: to oversteer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's like sailing, if you're a sailor,
it's like sailing a sailboat directly into
[SPEAKER_02]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to make a bunch of tacks along
the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go straight into the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have more buffering capacity,
we can head more towards the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like you put a motor on there
because you don't have to oversteer all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time to get yourself there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that said, RO is expensive,
especially when we're talking about water
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's becoming more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the issue is where do you put the
effluent from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're getting 50 to 60% conservatively
out of there that you can use,
[SPEAKER_02]: where does the 40 to 50% go that you can't
use that's now concentrated with the salts
[SPEAKER_02]: and things that you took out of your
water?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to find a place to put that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some places won't let you do anything with
that very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at it from a standpoint of total
water management.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I blend back at a 50% ratio,
that means that I have a whole lot less
[SPEAKER_02]: effluent as a percentage of my total water
going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not stripping everything out and
sending it down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, one of the things as a
sprayer manufacturer that concerns us
[SPEAKER_02]: about RO, in fact, we put labels on our
equipment now that say do not use RO in
[SPEAKER_02]: this machine by itself, straight RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always recommend blending back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is because RO,
as I mentioned before, is a universal
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hydrogen and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to your tap right now,
you will not have only hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have 30, 40, 50 other things in
that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because water, when it's just
hydrogen and oxygen, is very hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to bond with other things,
with other materials, with other minerals,
[SPEAKER_02]: metals, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put that water into systems with
certain metals, and actually, in some
[SPEAKER_02]: instances, all metals, even stainless,
we can cause damage to those components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can also strip some of the
components of those metals out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So RO going through brass fittings will
start to affect those brass fittings.
[SPEAKER_02]: RO going through brass fittings,
if we use certain disinfectants with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like hydrogen-based, peroxyacetic
acid-based products, we will accelerate
[SPEAKER_02]: that dramatically, stripping bits of the
metal out, causing oxidation of those
[SPEAKER_02]: components, causing some of those
components to end up in the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: causing damage to the machine or wear,
potentially stripping some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: components out and putting them onto your
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on what your crop is,
and the constituent metals in your spray
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, plumbing, you may be applying
those to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in a lot of instances, that's not a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some instances, there's some crops
where people are being tested for the
[SPEAKER_02]: metals that are on the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have to be very careful of
that from an RO standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: The RO is probably exacerbating the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear about people that complain about
their water, and they just go straight to
[SPEAKER_01]: RO systems and just use RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in the Seattle area, we're really
fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have really good water for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't had to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: RO is kind of the nuclear option.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way oversteer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go 20% of the way there and do a
much better job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to remove everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk with somebody that is adept at
water treatment, and we can help you very
[SPEAKER_02]: easily say, no, let's target this and get
it to a normal level, not strip the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing out and start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a couple other quick questions
for you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was to talk a little bit about
this nematode bucket that Suzanne
[SPEAKER_01]: Wainwright Evans raves about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you discuss a little bit about why
this came about and the importance of it
[SPEAKER_01]: when applying nematodes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the companies manufacturing
nematodes a number of years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I mentioned, we work fairly closely
with the manufacturers of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: plant-protected products that are in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of came to us and said,
hey, we have a real issue with nematodes
[SPEAKER_02]: in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest issue is that they're aerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They breathe air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in water, but they still
breathe air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what they'll do is they'll suck up
the oxygen in the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And start to go anoxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll basically start to
suffocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we really need, they said to us,
is we need something that'll help agitate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it would be great if we could add
oxygen at the same time so that it would
[SPEAKER_02]: basically mix them up in the tank,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better for distribution of the
product as well, but it also helps keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the oxygen mixed through the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we could add some air, that would
be oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started looking into different ways to
do it based on some recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, hey, we've done it with
bubbleers and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we just pump air into the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started going down that road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first attempts we made,
we weren't ever real happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that company basically said,
well, can you just help us get us the
[SPEAKER_02]: pump?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll tell customers, hey,
buy this air pump from Graham.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll put a little instructional video
on our website showing them how they can
[SPEAKER_02]: make this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with that is when you
compress air, it heats up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the secondary concerns that
they had, that they told us about when we
[SPEAKER_02]: first discussed this, was we don't want
the water to get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I compress air and pump it into a
bucket, it tends to get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it depends on how much compression I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while, the product kind of
languished for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And languished, and we didn't get it
finished until a number of years ago when
[SPEAKER_02]: we realized that we could inject oxygen
into a passing stream, which wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: compress the air, instead of pumping the
air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we started doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we've got a kit that we can now
add to the agitation systems on some of
[SPEAKER_02]: our hydraulic sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just add an air kit to our
hydraulic sprayer to oxygenate the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started out by making a bucket where
it's really too big for two buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: One bucket houses all the components
inside of it, and the other is just for
[SPEAKER_02]: the liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we recirculate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a switch where we can either
turn on or off the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it allows us to use it as an agitation
system, same for fertilizers and things as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might not want the air because it might
kind of cause bubbling and foaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we can flip the switch,
turn on the air injection, and that will
[SPEAKER_02]: add oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've been able to do is maintain
saturation levels of oxygen in the tank as
[SPEAKER_02]: we mix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, from a nematode standpoint,
anybody using nematodes has probably been
[SPEAKER_02]: very well-cautioned that you want to make
sure that for them to do the best job,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want them to be active and raring to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at just even some of the
instructional videos, they'll show
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures showing what they should look
like under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see them wiggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to see them all bent over
and kind of stiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might still be alive, but they're not
real active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of adding the oxygen is to
help keep them in an optimal state to go
[SPEAKER_02]: and do their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixing and agitating and oxygenating is
going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we developed that specifically for
that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the nice thing about the agitation
system is it'll mix up a fertilizer as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a dual purpose since you
can flip off the switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also make it in a,
like I said, we make a kit for our spray
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, but we also make a 50 gallon
stock system for really large areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some large growers where it's a
50 gallon tank with a Dosatron on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we had mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those places where we know
a Dosatron's not damaging a microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: product or in this case, a little worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have an agitation and aeration
system on that so that we can use it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 gallon stock tank full of nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's being used in large greenhouses
where they're basically where they are
[SPEAKER_02]: applying them through booms or hand
watering or whatever, but they've got
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple areas they're doing it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also allows you to get an even
application as in a certain number of
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes per say, per container or per
bed or per space that you're essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cover over a given application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, because what you're going to
do is you're going to mix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to be able to make sure the
concentration is even through the
[SPEAKER_02]: container, through the stock tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without agitation, they tend to sink to
the bottom, breathe up all the oxygen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they start to suffocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So agitation is helping, one, by mixing
them through the liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, the aeration is helping by adding
oxygen to that liquid to keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So changing direction, the last question I
have is, I know Suzanne Harps on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of growers are using paint sprayers,
which are not designed for horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was guilty of this when I first
started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has access to a paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about the
disadvantages and what we're missing out
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're using something like that for a
horticulture application?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the summary of that is
exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really designed for spray
applications of agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally aren't always the most
durable pieces of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not made for some of the products
we're putting in so they can cause damage
[SPEAKER_02]: to seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most commonly, that's what we see is seals
and things fail and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressures, things like that aren't always
really well thought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not designed for the type of duty
that's being put onto them.
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone's going to go use a paint
sprayer, most of the time they're buying
[SPEAKER_02]: something, they're going to go paint a
wall and it's going to take them 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes and they're going to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen guys take that into three,
four acres of greenhouse where it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take them several hours and it's not
the same kind of duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a standpoint of the size of the
motors to the seals and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's generally not meant for agricultural
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that said, some of the things that
some of them try to achieve, we use an
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural pump to produce a 3000 PSI
droplet to create a spray that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: A paint sprayer is doing something,
trying to do something similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: although it's generally using a diaphragm
pump, not a piston style pump,
[SPEAKER_02]: which depending on the products that
you're applying, maybe better,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe worse, but the diaphragm itself,
generally what we've seen with paint
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayers is those diaphragms themselves
aren't meant to tolerate some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: products that go through our machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly not powders.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just generally not good for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, these things are meant
to apply an oil-based or even a
[SPEAKER_02]: latex-based product, but they're not like
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different type of liquid and they
certainly aren't going to have powders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the time they don't tolerate
powders very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nozzles aren't really meant for that
type of application as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally, sometimes I think the
best you can get is a carbon steel tip,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can work in some cases, but with
other products it doesn't work real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the biggest thing I can say is
looking at how something designed,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned earlier when I was talking
about hydraulic sprayers that our
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophy about spray equipment is I want
to have the right pressures and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to create the right droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond that, the second most important
thing that we think is important in a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of equipment is that it is designed
to make that job easier, meaning the hose
[SPEAKER_02]: reel, the wheels, the pump, everything's
not going to fail in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it so that you don't
have to worry about flipping the switch,
[SPEAKER_02]: turning the pressure up and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's going to get in the way of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we find with paint spray equipment is
they haven't been designed for someone to
[SPEAKER_02]: take out into a greenhouse and pull around
and spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you get maybe a 25 foot hose on
some of those things and you got to pull
[SPEAKER_02]: it down an aisle or they're meant to use a
bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't agitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things all add up to making the
job, in our opinion, more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you have a pump that's going
to start failing on you because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: meant to handle the products you're
putting through it, it just makes that job
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more difficult for the grower and
it might be cheaper to go buy one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several different places of value
in pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the labor that's involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that are doing the job,
you're paying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other value is their happiness in your
workplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those types of things typically tend to
suffer when you have products that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have equipment that doesn't hold up and do
what they need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy spray and get frustrated and it
becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, you have the
consideration of the other value when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing this and that's your crop,
the plants that you are spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the potential in some of those
diaphragm-based paint sprayers for that
[SPEAKER_02]: diaphragm to crack, especially with some
of the products we're using that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not meant to tolerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that diaphragm crack and behind that
diaphragm is a big chamber full of
[SPEAKER_02]: pressurized motor oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want that to be sprayed on your
crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at like a piston style pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually designed so that if there is
a seal failure, the water flows into the
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, not the oil flowing in the water
because the pressure pressurized side is
[SPEAKER_02]: where the water is, the liquid is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pressurizing the liquid side with a
system like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil only serves to lubricate the
pistons.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a diaphragm-based pump, we're
pressurizing a chamber which makes the
[SPEAKER_02]: diaphragm fluctuate up and down,
which then transfers that pressure to the
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that diaphragm fails, that oil goes
right out the sprayer and with droplets
[SPEAKER_02]: and things that we're applying with that
type of equipment, the potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: damage to the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody really wants to
spray motor oil onto their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody would think that'd
be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we look at crop value is one of the
reasons why, yeah, okay, I might've gone
[SPEAKER_02]: to Home Depot and be able to buy a cheap
paint sprayer, but what's the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: liability in doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the potential cost of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the value of your crop,
it could be very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of those things,
it always makes me scratch my head when I
[SPEAKER_02]: see somebody buying something cheap like
that and then I walk into a room and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got a million dollars worth of
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say, okay, is this really a good
savings of money by, you saved a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that smart?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of my opinion on those
types of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they are meant to do
the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally don't hold up to the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cause potential liability and then
again, like I said, our philosophy is
[SPEAKER_02]: building for ease of use so that the guy
doing the job is comfortable doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I would think that the biggest
factor that you mentioned earlier in our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, what I've learned from you
is that the droplet size may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we may not getting the actual
coverage on the leaf surface that we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the spray application itself may not be
as effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's certainly true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been designed for spraying
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what it's producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those are capable of producing
some pretty fine droplets, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: meant to be doing that with like a varnish
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need the right tool for the right
job, which brings up one other thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking of because I was out in my
garden and I have one of your,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called a professional wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have a bunch of different
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a rain wand or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some sort of rain one, but I have one
of your ones and it has a really small
[SPEAKER_01]: head that's probably the size of like a
half dollar or smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a nice high quality one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that in my raised beds out
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I need one for the hose in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and bought a $10 one at Fred
Meyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the brand name and it has
all these nozzle adjustments I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: from shower to mist to whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I go to water with the nice
Dramas wand that I have in the front yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a really nice spray that's high
volume, but low pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can water my tomatoes and my peppers
without damaging them while they're small,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, still starting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the other one in the back,
even when I switched to different nozzles
[SPEAKER_01]: like shower, that's supposedly going to be
higher volume, less pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still like shooting it at this poor
plant and stressing that plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the right tool and maybe
spending a little more on like your water
[SPEAKER_01]: wands are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of, where I associate
Dram, you know, you started with this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest users give them a shot because
they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, we started 77 years ago with
the invention of the 400AL aluminum water
[SPEAKER_02]: breaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what we started as,
as a company, as a hand watering company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we make dozens of different nozzles
and we don't make them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we do have a consumer side of our business
where we sell those.
[SPEAKER_02]: In different colors, but we, on the
professional end, we make them all with
[SPEAKER_02]: different patterns, different hole sizes,
all meant to do different things,
[SPEAKER_02]: different width of pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a, you know, on the
professional end, we have a video,
[SPEAKER_02]: a series of videos that talk about,
you know, how to water and using the right
[SPEAKER_02]: tool for the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's sometimes when you need
a lot of water, sometimes don't need a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the right tool when, when doing that,
because as you said, I mean, one of,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my biggest pet peeves is those
multi-pattern heads because they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, you know, the old friend is jack
of all trades and master of none.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do anything well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get, you get, might get nine different
things you can do with it, but none of
[SPEAKER_02]: them is real is, is as good as what it
would be if you bought the two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: nozzles that you selected it for,
you know, and that's, so I appreciate you
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that because that's, yeah,
those are, that's a very important part of
[SPEAKER_02]: our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hand watering is, and we never,
you know, we've always known it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important, but especially when we talk to
professional growers, it's people that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that water all day, you know, and take it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very protective, very religious
about the watering tools they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I mean, it's, it's very nice to
be in that position to be trusted that
[SPEAKER_02]: well, because we don't have, you know,
we may have plenty of competition on the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer end where we're selling to,
you know, every home gardener,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, anybody with a, with a potted
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the professional end, we don't have
a lot of competition because nobody,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other stuff that's out there just
isn't, it's not, it's not meant for
[SPEAKER_02]: professional use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meant for a homeowner use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've, you know, we've been trusted by
the commercial horticultural industry for
[SPEAKER_02]: so long that, you know, it's, it's a,
it's a position we don't take lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we just, you know, just announced
we're modifying one of our oldest tools
[SPEAKER_02]: and offering a protective ring on the
outside of it that they could,
[SPEAKER_02]: because other customers have been asking
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come up with different nozzles and
valves and things all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we don't want to take for granted
that market, which in our opinion is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the professional market's very
picky and we liked, and so are we.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good fit.

up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm watering my front garden with a
nozzle and it's not as, it's not as good
[SPEAKER_01]: of one, you know, it's, it's annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I go to the, to our nursery and I
have to water for two hours, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cut off you know, a half an hour to
an hour of time just by using a better
[SPEAKER_01]: nozzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that cost of labor and like you
said, the happiness of the, of the labor
[SPEAKER_01]: using that product, it makes a big
difference because it drives me crazy when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, when the water pressure is so high
that I'm actually shooting soil back up
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the leaf tissue of my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I really do appreciate your,
your higher quality nozzles.

plants, I highly suggest you check them
