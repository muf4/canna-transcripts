[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a friendly reminder for folks who
enjoy the content and want to support the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that we have a Patreon for the
podcast where we do book club hangouts and
[SPEAKER_00]: share private content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also offer a wider range of products
ranging from living soils, LED lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, organic fertilizers,
and professional consulting at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is George Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: George has degrees in horticulture from
the University of Georgia and the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the GGS Pro technical service
manager with Griffin Greenhouse Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: GGS Pro assists ornamental, edible,
and hemp cannabis growers across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country with their cultivation issues
ranging from sanitation, IPM, fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, and water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: GGS Pro fields over 17,000 grower-related
calls and emails annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amount of valuable interaction helps
Griffin collaborate with chemical vendors,
[SPEAKER_00]: academic researchers, and plant producers
to implement change within the green
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, George, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now you're good friends with Michael
Alden, who's a prior guest who talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about a variety of topics around photo
period, internode spacing, and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practices that could influence
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that you're good friends with him
from college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about your
background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I go way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is in horticulture from
University of Georgia and the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am from the South, don't really sound
like it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently live in Golden, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fortunate because I've been blessed
with really good mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, right after grad school,
I met a man named Ricky Yates.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very well-known in the ornamental
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the head of the technical
department for Griffin Greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Griffin is a nationwide distributor for
plant products, both in the hard goods and
[SPEAKER_01]: live goods side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been very heavily involved with CDA,
ornamentals, and cannabis over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick basically just took me under his wing
and showed me all the things I didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the things that I could
potentially know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great team around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many things great to say about Griffin
and the family culture that they bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I really love about my job is I
tell growers this and they don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: like it, but I get to share all the
success, but none of the stress of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized quickly in grad school that I
couldn't sleep at night knowing I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I realized that I do love the
problem-solving aspects of helping
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that phone call rings or that email
pops up, it could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love about this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to learn a little bit about
everything which relates to crop
[SPEAKER_01]: protection, nutrition, cultural practices,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also at the same time, we get to
understand what are the new trends that
[SPEAKER_01]: are developing across the various
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very blessed and very grateful for my
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to hear all of the challenges that
are happening with the growers that you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What commonalities do you see around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there common issues or problems that
seem to arise consistently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing plants in general is not as
cookie-cutter as people may think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every operation is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every culture, meaning the people that are
involved, the stakeholders, everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the state in which they're growing in
is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say as far as the major source of
problems that we typically get is people
[SPEAKER_01]: have a problem and that could be pest or
disease related and they don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: tools they have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say tools, I mean both from a
cultural aspect as well as a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though people think it's got a very
defined culture and in some ways it does,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for most of the country, it's still
relatively new crop and from a legal side,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: State governments are still trying to
figure out what pesticides can and cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often see growers trying to use a
product that isn't approved illegally and
[SPEAKER_01]: then again, they may use it in a way that
they shouldn't be using it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Mike and his research,
I think is very groundbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the research coming out of
academia relates to fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural practices nowadays, but there's
hardly any research coming out on the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: protection side of things specifically to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fueling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I get the opportunity to speak,
I'm trying to tell growers to do internal
[SPEAKER_01]: trials, controlled trials, as well as our
vendor partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with basically every major vendor
from a crop protection standpoint under
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm urging them to do controlled trials on
cannabis specifically because growers want
[SPEAKER_01]: to know what is working, what is not,
and what is safe and what is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytotoxicity concerns are a very common
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we grow in an indoor
environment and growers may not understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how to apply a pesticide correctly in a
very controlled environment versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or even outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those contextual factors play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's cover that a little bit then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about a pesticide and I
guess it doesn't really matter what that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is, and correct me here as we
go, but I want to make sure we're always
[SPEAKER_00]: applying to the label rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've read the MSDS or SDS around that
product to know how to use it safely and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the proper PPE in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have protection in place and that the
application rate is established to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you maximum efficacy at the lowest
concentration and the least risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always important to apply to
application rate to avoid creating insect
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to whatever that chemistry is,
assuming it's a chemistry and not an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you would change in those
statements or anything you would add to
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I would definitely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The label is the law and that's something
we stand behind all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid to tell growers that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance is a major issue regardless of
what plant you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's advantageous for cannabis
growers is most of the products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: approved for cannabis use are what we
call, quote unquote, soft chemistry or
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial-based chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Bavarias, your Isarias, your
Aziractins, and Bacillus, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those active ingredients typically don't
deal with resistance issues like we do
[SPEAKER_01]: with hard chemistry or conventional
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's advantageous, but that
doesn't downplay the fact that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: be rotating depending on the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our cannabis grows almost every single day
and I can tell you the main ones are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be either it's going to be a root
aphid, it's going to be a cannabis aphid,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's either going to be a thrip,
spider mite, powdery mildew, or botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of overlap from what an
ornamental grower will deal with as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the toolkit is just much,
much smaller when we're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you listed a whole bunch of
different challenges in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to dive into any one of those
in particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just talk about microbials for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the microbials that we use,
they do very well in relatively cool
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, high humidity environments,
and that's almost exactly opposite of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to achieve in an indoor grow
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're usually shooting for high light,
extremely low relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so things dry out and that microbials
work the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm working with a grower,
it's very important they understand how to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage their HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually goes back to phyto as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A general rule of thumb when applying any
top pesticide is I want it to be less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 degrees in that growing environment and
I want relatively low humidity so it dries
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbials work a little bit differently
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do want to be applied at a cooler
temperature, but a slower drying condition
[SPEAKER_01]: or greater relative humidity allows for
them to do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's fungal-based, they're just going
to sporulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're bacterial-based, they're going
to populate more and they're going to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: on that insect for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to work with growers and make sure
they understand when they're doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: application or a series of applications
that they're managing their HVAC system so
[SPEAKER_01]: they maximize the efficacy of those
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oils are a great example of something that
can easily burn cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That temperature and light intensity
parameter needs to be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of growers are going,
I mean, not just the only reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the reasons why people are
going to dimmable LEDs or adjustable
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity LEDs is because they can lower
the light intensity so there's less
[SPEAKER_01]: actually light intensity or light stress
potentially on that plant when a pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: application is made until it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to remind folks too that
oils and sulfur do not mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I think there's better options
than sulfur in cannabis in most cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just want to throw that out there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you touched on with
humidity I wanted to talk about a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit because I'm seeing people running a
higher RH now that we're, as a community,
[SPEAKER_00]: more informed and learning and
understanding VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the VPD chart from Dr. Greenhouse,
Dr. Nadia Saba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of great ones out
there, but given that we're running
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly higher humidity, at least in veg
and through most of flour, does that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for better usage of a lot of these
pesticides then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say from a microbial
standpoint, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised if we have greater
pest pressure and disease pressure when we
[SPEAKER_01]: run higher relative humidity, but it's
much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going from like 20%, 40% relative
humidity, incredibly low relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, to now 50 to 60, and even a
little bit higher, especially in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's better just because we're not
stressing out the plant as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as a side note, I did an interview
with Nicole Goche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually following up with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a pathologist at the University of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was saying that one of the two species
of powdery mildew that infects in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually sporulate at 40% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even lower in humidity, now you're
stressing the plant, and you're still at
[SPEAKER_00]: risk if you have this particular species
of PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating optimal conditions for it
to reproduce, which I thought was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get powdery mildew here in Colorado,
and people think we're incredibly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how the cultures between
ornamentals and cannabis is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I believed there was quite a bit
of tension, but I think now we're starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn from each other as we get closer
integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important because cannabis
growers are going to need to learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about greenhouse production as that
becomes more of a norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, with powdery mildew,
we know just from greenhouse production
[SPEAKER_01]: that it typically rears its head most on
the shoulders of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: From winter to spring, and then basically
summer to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those transitional times where powdery
mildew pressure just tends to skyrocket,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I like that we're learning from each
other and communicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just also touch on,
you brought up a really good point around
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity because a lot of the
research coming out by Dr. Bruce Bugby now
[SPEAKER_00]: is showing higher light intensity can
increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pushing the envelope pretty high in
terms of PAR or PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that as people start
running higher light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do need to dim it down to avoid
phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do an application of like Cephalox,
for example, I don't always consider what
[SPEAKER_00]: my light intensity is because I have never
really pushed it that high, but if I were
[SPEAKER_00]: to run a higher light intensity,
I would want to potentially dial it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you want to talk about when we
should be spraying during the light cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another important aspect,
depending on the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this exact question came up
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, ideally, if I was in a
greenhouse situation, I'd be ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to apply in the morning hours,
so light intensities are relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're increasing, but they're relatively
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity can definitely start high and
then start to go down as the sun rises,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's preferable to be in the morning
because we still have cool enough
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions for phyto to be reduced,
but then also we ensure that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to go into the evening
hours or dark time hours with wet foliage
[SPEAKER_01]: or wet flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the flip side of that, the reason why
it logistically doesn't always occur and
[SPEAKER_01]: why spraying doesn't occur in the morning
hours is because of REIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the pesticide, it can range
from anywhere from four hours to 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: or even 24 hours, depending on the
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, most of our organic or softer
chemistries have very low REIs,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that does free up the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I spray something, I still have to
follow the REI and I can't handle that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for X amount of hours until that REI
is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those unfamiliar, REI stands for
return entry interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the amount of time before you can go
back into that space after spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the particular pesticide or spray
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to let folks know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, you get a lot of stuff
around it sounds like pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about with pest pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing a lot with hemp russet
right now or any particular mite pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone once asked me, is there ever a
situation when you're an indoor grower
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can completely 100% eliminate
pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them it's most likely not feasible
because somebody is either entering or
[SPEAKER_01]: exiting that building or probably the
product is either entering or exiting the
[SPEAKER_01]: building.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sole reason and reason why we
end up having an infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these indoor operations are very
buttoned up, very, very tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, employees do do a great
job of transferring pests into a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, broad mites, spider mites,
hemp russet mite, they're all great
[SPEAKER_01]: hitchhikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will jump onto or whenever an
employee rubs up against that plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: has that pest, they do a great job of
clinging onto them and then moving
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the production space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, sanitation and they're trying
to prevent any type of pest entering the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp russet mite has been around for some
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a really big issue maybe
two years ago when it started really
[SPEAKER_01]: affecting everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is once you have a hemp
russet mite issue, what I'd like to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: growers similar with broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad mites are just as hard because you
can't see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp russet mite is very difficult to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad mites, same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You typically see the damage first and
then you realize you then have an
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what I don't, and this is going
to probably really make some people not
[SPEAKER_01]: feel good, but the best way to start out
with an issue like that infestation is
[SPEAKER_01]: culling plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say culling, I mean throwing out
plants that have the highest pest
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to spend more money and
resources and have a much uphill battle
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to solve an infestation when you've
got just a select few plants that are the
[SPEAKER_01]: source of that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to throw out or destroy
those plants and then start your pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't consider doing that
because they want to try to save every
[SPEAKER_01]: plant they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just something to think about,
especially if you're growing a large
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to throw away a few plants if
they're the most symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Physically reducing inoculum is actually a
very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see enough growers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear that suggested very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying if there's a hot spot in a
room rather than trying to spray it or
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say you're in flower,
mid flower to where you can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: pistol pistol growth is already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really spray anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficials take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the classic example is by the time
you have webbing, if you're in flower with
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, it's already too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying just take them out,
reduce that overall pressure, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with a plan for the rest of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works in the same way in the ornamental
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not necessarily able to do
this, but on ornamentals, let's say I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a sweet potato vine, very common
ornamental that is an attractant to a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of pests that also affects cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I've got broad mites and broad mites
and mites in general are really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting because what you'll see when
you look at the damage is that the older
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, more established growth,
doesn't seem that symptomatic or damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you move up into the plant to the
more systematic areas, you actually see
[SPEAKER_01]: the damage get worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening is the mite species are
actually moving up to the new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reproducing in greater number and
causing more damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we sometimes do in ornamentals,
if it's allowable, is I cut off the
[SPEAKER_01]: affected portions of the plant where those
mites are present and just basically
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, I'm pinching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pinching that plant and then allowing
the lateral growth, the underneath growth
[SPEAKER_01]: to then expand and the mites are not
present there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a small cultural method and it
doesn't really make sense for most
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis situations unless I was talking
about mother stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might make sense in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're early enough in veg too that you
can just lower your canopy, I could see
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you did across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought of hemp russet or
broad mite damage as that twisted new
[SPEAKER_00]: green growth, a little bit lighter green
coloring too, almost like an iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the leaves will do this twisting
distortion to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you really need to get out your scope
and make sure you can't just use your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a dino light or something that's
going to give you a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: magnification and a little better clarity
to really see it, at least in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work a lot off photos and phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get really creative on their
adjectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use to describe symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers aren't comfortable sharing
photos, which is perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I like to think about,
what I like to ask the growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the uniformity of the issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I walk into a situation, first thing
I want to know is, is it an abiotic issue
[SPEAKER_01]: or a biotic issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everything we've been talking about
thus far are biotic issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're caused by living things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, when we have a biotic issue,
the uniformity is not incredibly uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was a fertilizer issue or a
nutritional issue, it's going to affect
[SPEAKER_01]: all the plants relatively the same way
because they're all receiving the same
[SPEAKER_01]: input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with phyto, like a phyto toxicity
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sprayed something and it was way too
hot or I played something and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the correct rate, it's going to damage
those plants uniformly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, that makes me think, okay,
this is going to be an abiotic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas biotic issues tend to be much more
localized or spread out more randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout a production area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out some other things
to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an abiotic issue if you had a
fan, for example, in a corner that was
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a different air pocket that maybe
allowed PM to start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your abiotic issue could be creating
your biotic problem to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, plant stress,
whether that's from fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies or excesses, can lead,
especially around nitrogen, can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: higher pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are all really
interconnected, just making it way more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right, you have to be a
detective when you walk in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like if you're looking at it from a
nutrient perspective, we want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is this issue occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the entire plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a mobile nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an immobile nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like people to send me photos of
the issue and then also the whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the whole room so we can really
get an idea of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could give you an entire album of poor
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is, but it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's amazing some of these one-leaf
photos on the hand or just a very blurry
[SPEAKER_01]: photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're ever working with us or any
technical specialist, please just take the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to send a few clear photos and like I
said, whole plant photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see the tops, we want to see
the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, especially nutritionally,
if something's affecting or
[SPEAKER_01]: disease-related, if something's affecting
the top, we want to look at the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately to see if that's like you
said, the primary issue leading to a
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary issue that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should absolutely kick a pot out of
the container and take a look at the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: or dig into their bed or their container
and see what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people forget about that a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget about it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of root pathogens that
we need to rule out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a lot about pest pressures
and things like that, but what cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices are you seeing being implemented
that are being most effective or giving
[SPEAKER_00]: growers the best chance of success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what is not being
implemented because I think that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are standard practices that are used
in the ornamental side that I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: should be utilized or at least adopted and
trialed on the cannabis side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is called dip and one is called diff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have DIP and DIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll first talk about diff first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can manipulate plant stretching or
architecture by adjusting the average
[SPEAKER_01]: daily temperature, daytime temperature,
and average nightly temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between those averages,
if there's a more positive diff,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning there's a greater day temperature
than a night temperature, the greater that
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, the more we're going to get in
plant stretching, the less difference we
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a diff of zero, meaning that my
average day temperature and average night
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature are the exact same,
then we can basically reduce stretching or
[SPEAKER_01]: even in situations, this is primarily done
in indoor situations, where I can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative diff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually have a higher night
temperature than my daytime temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can create more of a stunt to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not seeing that trialed and I would
love to see how that affects plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically vegetative architecture as well
as flower architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's diff and that's a very common
practice used in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's a slight offset of that
is called dip, DIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is, and this is primarily
more important for greenhouse or outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: situations, is that we know from research
that the first few hours, about three
[SPEAKER_01]: hours as the sun is rising, lower light
intensities and the quality of the light
[SPEAKER_01]: is different and the majority of plant
stretch actually occurs in the first three
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of daybreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: What growers will do on the ornamental
side is they will actually drop their
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures in the greenhouse by about
five degrees lower than what their average
[SPEAKER_01]: night temperature is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the sun rising for about three
hours and during this time, the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to wake up and starting to become
photosynthetically active, but because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the light intensity itself and the
quality, it's wanting to stretch,
[SPEAKER_01]: very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can reduce that ability or that plant's
ability to want to stretch by dropping the
[SPEAKER_01]: night, dropping that temperature and
creating a cold stress to prevent that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two cultural practices I don't
see used and I don't even see it cited in
[SPEAKER_01]: literature related to cannabis yet,
but I foresee that happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with diff, though I haven't
really thought of the implications within
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which is crazy when you say it
like that because it does seem worth
[SPEAKER_00]: trialing and the dip thing I haven't even
heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people would take that up as some
research because I think that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of anyone running a negative
diff in cannabis and I also wonder how CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: plays a role, if any, in the fact that we
have such great amounts of CO2 production
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at night, especially in the
these living soil beds, which is the realm
[SPEAKER_00]: that I worked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to think about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other cultural practices are you
seeing really being maybe done wrong or
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you hear continually that are
just little mistakes that you think people
[SPEAKER_00]: could avoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think overwatering cannabis can
easily be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underwatering cannabis can easily be an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of research that's going to come out
in the next couple of years is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use certain crops as model crops
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poinsettia, like I said, Michael Alden did
a good, he's equated kind of poinsettias
[SPEAKER_01]: as a model crop for poinsettia for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a lot of overlap,
but poinsettia is a crop that doesn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with a lot of poinsettia growers
and I tell them if you're going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: dry grower, be a dry grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be a wet grower,
be a wet grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't change your tactics really midway
through the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know a lot of people do dry down
steering and there's a lot of information
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding that, but in general,
if we're talking just mass production of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you're safer being more routine
in your irrigation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one way people are getting around
that are providing some buffer to poor
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation management is converting to
peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, peat moss as far as a growing
media has become much more accepted over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last couple of years as before the
traditional ways of growing and still are
[SPEAKER_01]: very prominent as corn and grow down to
rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, living soil, as you said,
that's a complete different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see a lot of growers converting
to peat both from a moisture management
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint reason, as well as from a
nutritional standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it has a much higher CEC or
cation exchange capacity, meaning it holds
[SPEAKER_01]: on a nutrition much more heavily compared
to something like core or growth band,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is relatively inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like peat just because the lower
pH allows me to front load a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients into the soil mix prior to
planting, which is something with core
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're already starting at seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the inputs that I want to add are
cations or their alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pushes my pH out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my biggest reason for liking peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's more sustainable than
people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some interesting research around
the replenishment of peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's perfect, but I think
you could easily make the argument for it
[SPEAKER_00]: over cocoa core in a lot of ways with the
amount of fossil fuel and ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: damage associated around core production.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whatever input you use for your
growing media, it's one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever you're buying it through,
it needs to be a very quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to go through a very rigorous
QAQC process because you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: product that unfortunately, let's say,
I mean, core, for example, there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: core sources that would not be buffered,
meaning they haven't been leached
[SPEAKER_01]: typically with either clear water or
calcium nitrate to basically rinse out the
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive salts that are in that media
during the process of the processing of
[SPEAKER_01]: that media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just I think peat in general,
it's been around for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the major producers of peat,
they have a very good processes and
[SPEAKER_01]: typically the quality is reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the quality of cocoa core
has gotten a lot better over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of those inconsistencies have
improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've never been one to use a lot
of cocoa core in any of my mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something I have as much
experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked into other options and you are
seeing more options showing up from like
[SPEAKER_00]: wood pulp to wood pulp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't been able to get the same
quality of growth or production that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: with peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until I can get something to replace
it, I mean, there's somewhere you could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially reduce the amount of peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can replace, say, like 20 to 30
percent of the peat in your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not they're not able to fully
replace it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope we get there with the new
substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say, I mean, we're getting
off topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Brian Jackson from NC State,
I mean, he is spearheading the research
[SPEAKER_01]: for, I would say, uncommon amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's specifically I've got
a very good relationship with Brian,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know if he's specifically
looking at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he is if anyone's interested in wood
fiber or anything that's non-traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: peat amendments or soil media or soil
media products, definitely it's worth
[SPEAKER_01]: giving him a research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll have to hitch up for an
introduction later after the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'd love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then what I guess I want to dive a
little bit into what sort of products do
[SPEAKER_00]: you find you tend to recommend the most
for folks that are that are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of talked about some of the more
general things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we got a little more specific
into some of the things that you tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: generally recommend more frequently than
others?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about from an IPM standpoint
or nutritional standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can we can do either,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start with IPM because we've
kind of been talking about talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it once again depends on the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of examples of really good
states that are doing an active job of
[SPEAKER_01]: updating lists and providing publicly
publicly available lists of active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients or specific products that are
approved would be like New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are kind of the in my mind,
they're the role model for I would hope
[SPEAKER_01]: most states eventually move to actually
publishing lists and updating them of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that can be used a lot of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it is a wild goose chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were trying to we'd have to
sometimes call in to state government or
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard for them to want to
give us an answer, because frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they don't know or the law hasn't
been written enough with guidance to for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be able to to give us a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I hate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that sometimes we can't the
government's not helping us to help
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the growers have a have a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what solutions they can
legally use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's never a good situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that aside, the most the most the
products that I see that are on these sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of approved state lists are going to be
your Bavaria, Bassiano products,
[SPEAKER_01]: your Isaria, Formosia products,
all your bacillus products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this Bacillus subtilis, Fumilis,
Ambocay fashions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using all these scientific names,
but these are the kind of the main staple
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredients that are utilized by
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we take kind of microbials out of
the equation, then we have oils and soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those play an incredibly, incredibly
powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mealybugs aren't really a major issue in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardly ever seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But soaps play a major role for mealybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for oils, those play a major role
for pretty much all of our insects under
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun and all of our miticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there really is no good miticides
out there other than oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's that's going to be a staple
in every growers operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking all those microbials out of the
situation, we still have oxidizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is more on a disease prevention
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your Sanidates, your atolls,
any of your hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic acid products, those are
incredibly valuable, both from a biofilm
[SPEAKER_01]: and algae prevention standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to remember, wherever there's water
and fertilizer, there's going to be algae
[SPEAKER_01]: and biofilm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I don't care if you're an indoor
operation or outdoor operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a literally a physical and
equipment problem for anyone using
[SPEAKER_01]: drippers or hoses or piping, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So injecting continuously or periodically
injecting our Sanidates or Sanidates or
[SPEAKER_01]: Ziritol or hydrogen peroxide, parasitic
acid products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good way to prevent that algae and
biofilm from coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also they're incredibly versatile
fungicide and bactericidal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do see some growers solely relying on
something like Ziritol or Sanidate or
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanidate 12.0 because Sanidate 5.0 isn't
level with plant plant contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Ziritol, for example, very broad
label, see that used a lot both in fogging
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, foliar applications and
drenching applications as their sole sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of product for disease prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the with the fogging and things
like that, are you seeing any phytotoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity with those types of products?
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, Ziritol is fairly safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I'm not going to drop any
names, but do know some very reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: growers who have tried done some internal
trials with Ziritol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, they're spraying all the way
to harvest and not having a degradation on
[SPEAKER_01]: THC levels or cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be curious how I would like to see
some controlled studies because it is an
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have to have some chemical impact
on terpenes and cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just love to see where that
threshold is and what it actually does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as phyto is concerned,
I mean, it's all about rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important that you read the label
and do I I always try to preach this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but doing small scale, small scale trials
can save you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, growers don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just mix up one gallon here and
there, spray a few plants, see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do encourage growers to do that,
especially as they're just establishing
[SPEAKER_01]: rates that work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, Ziritol can be fairly safe
if the rates are or the rates are correct
[SPEAKER_01]: and the application process is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mentioned fogging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up fogging, fogging or ULV,
ultra low volume equipment or applicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming very, very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been it's been I mean, DRAM is I'm
not going to lie, DRAM is spearheaded
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the best quality foggers on
the market and they are doing the due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence to understand how to actually
apply it in a safe way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing a lot of indoor growers use
like an autofogger or a mini autofogger by
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know a grower who's
invested in one and not liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just great because you basically mix
it up, set the timer, set it in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces quite a bit from that employee
safety standpoint that that hits home
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also it's just not labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nowhere near labor intensive as
getting on PPE and getting a backpack
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer on and spraying plants in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one really wants to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ULV technology is I think it's we're
just kind of in the the the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it can be very good in a lot
of different situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It typically tends to reduce the chances
of phyto because we're ultimately using
[SPEAKER_01]: less chemical per square footage and the
particle size itself is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not getting when I look at phyto,
for example, what oftentimes happens is we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a congregation of liquid or active
ingredient on the edges of the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's all kind of just dripping
down into that area and accumulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the phyto damage can
occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you fog something, it's uniformly
getting those particles that AI across the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire leaf surface and we don't have that
puddling effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in essence does prevent phyto in
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to be careful what products
like you mentioned a bunch of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any that can go through a
fogger just to let folks know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'm wrong here, but in my
experience, the fogger is pretty much just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to destroy all even the bacillus
species from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily, there are different types of
foggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are thermal based and some are
basically using such high pressure and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it through such a fine screen that
it's kind of creating that small particle
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many autofoggers, for example,
pulse fogger or bio pulse foggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulse foggers are thermal, but there's a
bio pulse fogger by DRAM that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into it, but basically
allows us to put microbials through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autofoggers, they're non thermal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can use microbials and softer
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we put together fogging charts for
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you buy a DRAM, some sort of fogger
through Griffin, we'll put together a
[SPEAKER_01]: customized chart for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tell us the square footage of your
production space and we can tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: products are properly labeled for fogging
and the rates to use them at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something specific to Griffin
that no other distributor does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that aside, it just depends on the
fogger itself and we can use microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some get broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to touch on with
microbials, because you mentioned a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different species, everything from
Bavaria to Isaria, bacillus, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a big difference,
I think, in quality and efficacy based on
[SPEAKER_00]: not just where you source it, but also the
species itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't assume that all Bavaria is the
same, all bacillus, subtilis is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that needs to be taken into
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just taking Bavaria as an example,
I know the Bioceras product, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a very specific range of humidity and
heat and cold temperatures, drought
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that they can handle and thrive
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could look at a different
Bavaria product and say, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe because it's a different species,
it may do slightly better or worse in a
[SPEAKER_00]: given environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's worth trying out different
ones, kind of be looking at SporeCamp and
[SPEAKER_00]: not taking it to be the Bible,
because what says on the label is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always what's in the package, but at least
give you an idea of whether or not this
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a viable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, I don't work in sales at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only just try to provide solutions and
try to be unbiased as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: just given the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes a grower will ask us,
OK, well, we see there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different Bavaria products or Azadirachtin
products out there, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one should I go with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I go, OK, well, let's look at
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always a good parameter to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to do cost and use analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the cost per gallon or cost per
gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Per pound of AI or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very quick calculation we do all
the time just to let the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, OK, well, this is more in my
budget range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm willing to maybe jeopardize some
maybe level of quality to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still applying the right amount of
active ingredient given my price range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about like, what do I want to
have in my pantry as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've been thinking more
and more about lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sorts of tools, let's say with IPM,
would you want to keep in your pantry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say definitely an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: With what's available, I'd have a bacillus
as my fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have also trichodermis, like root
shield, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very common, sort of inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about all these
microbials, they should really be used
[SPEAKER_01]: preventatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like BCAs, biological control
agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should go into this with the mentality
and perspective of, I'm putting this out
[SPEAKER_01]: to prevent anything that develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: These software chemistries, they're just
not really meant to be a come from behind
[SPEAKER_01]: product or a knockdown product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them do have some of those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's always better to be using these
preventatively, proactively rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: reactively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we've named some of the major
ones I would definitely have.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of conventional chemistries
that I wish would be accepted in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: use just because they would, I think,
be a game changer, especially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicidal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with insecticides, there's a fine
line between hard chemistry and soft
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we move to fungicides,
there's definitely some that are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: gray area that are currently used or
labeled for edible use that I could easily
[SPEAKER_01]: see be used in cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you'd want an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, and a bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I would put an oil, some sort of
horticultural oil, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used a lot of bacillus species
from a pesticide or prevention aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only used them for nutrient cycling
and those sorts of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting that you mentioned
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, yes, you'll see these soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its labeling is an interesting art,
I will say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are certain things that are
labeled as soil amendments or soil
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants that will have a variety of
different bacillus species that you will
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have pesticidal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look in other fungicides that have
those active ingredients, the producer of
[SPEAKER_01]: that product just cannot legally make
those claims or they'd have to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say with Bavaria, and this is
with oils too, a lot of these microbials
[SPEAKER_01]: can be tank mixed and there's symbiotic
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say synergistic relationships with
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bavaria tank mixed with aziractin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aziractin is an extract from neem oil and
it's an IGR and insect growth regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pairing these becomes a very powerful and
broad spectrum application.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is that most of these
microbials, either Bavaria, either fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: or bacterial based, is that we're trying
to ultimately coat the insect or mite or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever we're trying to go after.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to coat them and get as much
of that active ingredient on them as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is that if it's
fungal based, it's going to ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: sporulate inside that insect and kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's bacterial based, typically what
happens is if they get wet, then it can
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolve in through a membrane like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also what I like about bacteriums or
bacterial based pesticides is that when
[SPEAKER_01]: they eat the foliage that has the
bacterium in it, they're ingesting it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, if I pair it with an
aziractin, an IGR insect growth regulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps that spore on there for longer,
like aphids for any of our major insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going through molting processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're continuously trying to molt to
ultimately become adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can use an IGR to prevent them
from molting, they can't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: physically shed the spores or inoculum
we're putting on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why it's a great
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very common program we recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically we're doing that on a five
to seven day interval as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: reapplication interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I was thinking of while you
were talking about this that we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned is nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a recent podcast with Julie Grash
from BioWorks talking a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just recently made a recommendation
of the SF or Steiner Neme Feltier,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mispronounced it, nematodes specifically
as a preventative because especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: living soils or when you have any compost
fraction or any organic matter in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going to at the very least
have fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the numerous other things
that these nematodes work so effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play nicely with Bavaria and other
microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that would go in my pantry too,
now that we're talking about things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: love to have as a part of a maintenance
IPM program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get me started on BCAs,
that'd be a whole other talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Julie's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I love also about my position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to interact with all these really
good professionals and these different
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, Steiner Neme Feltier,
and there's other different beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes out there depending on what
we're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love beneficial nematodes specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: SF, specie, because it goes after the
thrift pupa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't, a lot of people don't
understand this, but when thrift,
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically have two larval stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they want to pupate,
meaning that they want to become an adult,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll actually drop to the sole surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's at that point, the nematodes
actually become very beneficial there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they play a very key role for both
fungus gnats, even shore flies and thrift
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a tool, it's not chemical,
but I'm seeing growers, not enough growers
[SPEAKER_01]: use it, but I'm starting to see ornamental
growers massive ornamental growers use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's yellow sticky tape, not cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yellow sticky cards, everyone's
probably familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've seen it in an operation on a bench
right above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that yellow sticky card is meant for
scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really meant to see what is present
that's flying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yellow sticky tape, it literally comes
in several hundred foot rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wrap that between benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have actually a physical way
of reducing the disease or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the insect pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really, really works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could share my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd show you a photo of several operations
using it, especially in the Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: where fungus gnats are just out of
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fill every square inch of that sticky
tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a cool little cultural tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see enough growers using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insectary produces it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also produce these clips that are
very helpful to attaching them to
[SPEAKER_01]: structures, but definitely something to
look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we work with Catchmaster who makes a
lot of these type of cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen the rolls in facilities
though, actually mass trapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what you're describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I was in, it was primarily root
aphids at the time and they were very
[SPEAKER_00]: prolific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see them all over the tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a big issue then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were brushing them off of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were walking out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I learned on that one that
was kind of interesting is they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out why there were dead winged
adult root aphids on the buds themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on what people call sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, I talked to Suzanne about
this, what she said was happening was they
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually going up too close to the
light, dying and then falling back down
[SPEAKER_00]: and landing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't any sort of IPM practice that
they had that was killing these,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they had guessed some different
bacterias possibly or other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really just the mechanical action
of flying up into the lights and coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back down and landing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, pretty crazy to see on that
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids are tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a good facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not throwing them under a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem that once you have it,
it's very hard on the commercial scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to solve it is to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root aphids can be a really bad one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is they create an economic
loss, but they don't kill the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never allow your plants to really
reach maximum yield or maximum progression
[SPEAKER_01]: because they stress out the roots from day
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see as far as primary control
mechanisms for that, if allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a botanigard or a Bavaria product
that's labeled for drenching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tank mix with an Azirac and that's also
labeled for drenching and doing a full
[SPEAKER_01]: volume substrate drench literally to
almost leach, basically to leach.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some certain situations in states,
pyrethrins can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would never catch me recommending
a pyrethroid for aphid control on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental side because there's just so
much resistance to that sort of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the ornamental, on the cannabis
side of things, we haven't used pyrethrins
[SPEAKER_01]: again and again and again on root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are certain states that do allow
a pyrethroid drench and then there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: a few pyrethroid products that I'm aware
of that actually have a drench label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pyganic would be an example of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen that be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never really messed with
pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that I'm excited for this
granulated Bavaria product from Biosares.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually something I'm using right
now in my garden because it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into the media and then you
get a slower release of Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue with the root aphids is,
I mean, that's a great suggestion with the
[SPEAKER_00]: botanogard, but I don't feel like the
spores, the Bavaria spores are really
[SPEAKER_00]: making it to the bottom of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really those holes in the bottom
container where the water seeps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real problem location that
there really isn't a great solution for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think incorporating into the media
might be a good option for really getting
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria down in throughout the whole
container to help with the root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with fungus gnats, we typically see
them in the top one to two inches of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm talking to a grower who's
new to nematodes, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't tell them to drench the entire
media because really the three people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungus gnats, they're in that just top
layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just more of like just a quick,
quick watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want them to waste chemical or
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to root aphids,
like you said, they do easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they'll use it as a
transport is when someone's a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: waterer or they're leaching or whatever it
may be, they'll flush out the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the container between of the holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll just work their way to
another pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do see some growers in this,
I don't want to harp on pyrethroids
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not very commonly used in
cannabis or accepted in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what growers will do is they'll
physically do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll leach their pots to force the root
aphids to want to leave the exit holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will spray between the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is real, I don't think this makes
sense for a large scale, but for a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: operation, I can see that making sense
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like we've been talking for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else that you wanted to
touch on before we sign off for this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, I really appreciate the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone ever wants to just reach out
to GGS Pro, which is the technical arm of
[SPEAKER_01]: Griffin, we're happy to help you in any
way we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to learn from you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about all the great things in
my position and the people I work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I also get to work with every
different type of grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be an educator at heart,
but honestly, we continue learning because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things we learn from growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just want to even want to call
and pick our brain, we're going to just be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared because we're going to ask you
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to understand what you're doing
and what's working and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good to know as a resource
for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to kind of piggyback on that,
I find that when people reach out to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of times I may not have the
answer, but just having that network
[SPEAKER_00]: within both cannabis and horticulture and
be able to reach out to people at these
[SPEAKER_00]: other companies or universities,
your network is obviously very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to find an answer is really the
best thing because then everyone learns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of people smarter than
me out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just glad I get to interact with
them on a daily basis sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any available resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned that you have these
fogging charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other things that are like I
could go to the website right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: check out or are they all things that you
guys keep until the grower reaches out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find out about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to go onto the Griffin
Greenhouse Supplies website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a tab dedicated to GGS Pro,
the technical team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to talk as much as we can as
far as public speaking events,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the major trade shows, as well as
we're writing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pretty much have a bulletin for
every major problem you might run into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the more obscure ones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are online articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely start with the website,
but you can also just email us at
[SPEAKER_01]: ggsprotech at griffinmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easiest way to get in contact with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you again for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we can stay in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you.
