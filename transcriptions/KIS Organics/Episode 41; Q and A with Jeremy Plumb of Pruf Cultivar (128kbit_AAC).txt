[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first guest in 2019 is Jeremy Plum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy is the Director of Production
Science at Proof Cultivar, one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: technological advanced cannabis
cultivation facilities in all of North
[SPEAKER_02]: America.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Proof, Jeremy combines decades of
cannabis horticulture experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge technology to deliver
previously unattainable consistency in
[SPEAKER_02]: both product quality and consumer effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to his leadership at Proof,
Jeremy was a co-founder of Pharma,
[SPEAKER_02]: recently acclaimed by Rolling Stone as one
of Oregon's top dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy has served as a cannabis consultant
to Israel Medical Cannabis Researchers as
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabis policy advisor for U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also serves on the OLCC's Rulemaking
Advisory Committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015, Jeremy co-founded Cultivation
Classic, Oregon's leading craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: He serves on the Technical Advisory Board
of the Resource Innovation Institute and
[SPEAKER_02]: is the co-founder of the Open Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Portland, Oregon with his
border collie Lucy and when he can finds
[SPEAKER_02]: few greater joys than sailing on the
mighty Columbia River.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught back up with Jeremy this week and
got to ask him many of your questions as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as a few of my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hey Jeremy, thanks for coming
back on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's a pleasure, Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited to be back with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well let's just dive right in
with questions because I've gotten a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past week and a half and I had a
few of my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna go ahead and take the ones
from Guest first.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was left on the YouTube channel
from AK Frost and he said, I'm curious
[SPEAKER_02]: about the different red spectrums effects
on the plant's production, quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what were his findings as far as
best target PPFDs for different stages of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's life or age?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, actually, if you could repeat the
second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually didn't hear that clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the first part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you wanna address the first one,
he's asking about red spectrum effects on
[SPEAKER_02]: plant production, quality, and cannabinoid
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in terms of morphology or production
quality, we know that red light has this
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on plants that is either shade
avoidant or shade tolerant in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has this remarkable evolutionary
heritage of clearly being shade avoidant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which if you read Rob Clark's Evolution
and Ethnobotany Treaties that he wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: with George Merlin, one of the early sort
of theories he had is that when
[SPEAKER_00]: hunter-gatherers were bringing seeds back
to where human settlements were and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were sort of both being consumed and
also cast by the area where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabiting, these plants, while they're
growing under a forest canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: sopping up most of the near red light,
were quite responsive to the far red light
[SPEAKER_00]: still passing through the canopy,
thus creating these really long plants
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching up to capture the light again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really, you see this shade avoidant
behavior, but that has some unfavorable
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one I talked about,
some of the favorable outcomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the unfavorable outcome is in general,
we're trying to reduce lanky cultivars and
[SPEAKER_00]: create more compact, consistent growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's some balance there if you're
seeing some elongated internodal spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in terms of phytochemistry,
we're seeing nominal effects that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have not been fully quantified,
even though we're about a year deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: this, only this last three-month round is
really mature enough to be able to clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I actually can't say with any kind
of definitive answer what the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: is yet, but there is a difference for sure
in a future podcast that could definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then he was asking what your
findings were as far as best target PPFD
[SPEAKER_02]: levels for different stages of plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is a complicated theme that I'll
try to be succinct in responding to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that the PPFD targets for
different developmental stages varies
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly, both by cultivar and which sort
of region you're bringing those cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, highlight regions affect the
evolution of the plant to be receptive to
[SPEAKER_00]: heightened PPFD targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example, just the most simple
level is that a narrow blade morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly had something like an abundance of
solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A broad blade morphology was probably
trying to more efficiently capture that
[SPEAKER_00]: solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, that kind of can tell you in a
spectrum between narrow and broad leaf if
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant was likely to be able to receive
higher or lower amounts of light in an
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal sort of setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of PPFD targets that we use,
I was at the PhotoX conference with you
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and I met a man from Group 04
who's running really mega high intense
[SPEAKER_00]: targets in early veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, if you get highlight in early veg
and the plants can tolerate it without
[SPEAKER_00]: causing harm, you find that you actually
get to this super metabolic plant that has
[SPEAKER_00]: got incredibly thick stock and is going to
have more biomass creation, more
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemical yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not found that plants can tolerate
near to the levels that he was describing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without going too far down the
wormhole, something like in propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: with dimmable LEDs, one of the huge
advantages is that you can graduate the
[SPEAKER_00]: light from a very low amount in that first
couple of days while rooting has not begun
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're really adjusting to this kind
of new environment and then graduate maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: around 150 to 250 U mols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production goes into a vegetative
environment in the vicinity of 400 U mols.
[SPEAKER_00]: In blooming environments, we're seeing
with people that are running double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS somewhere near 800 to 900 U mols.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of like our LED implementation
is that we're getting closer to 1400 U
[SPEAKER_00]: mols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gradations and the different sort of
developmental stages for different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars very widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to not try to
approach a one size fits all solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: to really find what your plants and your
particular environment, where the best
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to add to this and correct me
if I say anything wrong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember at Photo-X there was some
research presented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it I believe from Dr. Allison
Justice who's coming on the podcast soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did some research looking at different
target PPFD levels from an efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective in terms of yield and the cost
of that lighting from I believe she was
[SPEAKER_02]: using wattage over time at 800,
1000 and then 1200.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that facility using the cultivars,
they found that 1000 was that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet spot for yield and light efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another one presented where they
went up to I believe 1500 U mols looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at it and found that cannabis could
tolerate, this particular cultivar could
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerate those high light levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hadn't found that upward limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, at that point I think the issue is
more light efficiency in terms of what
[SPEAKER_02]: your yield is sort of on a bell curve as
it was explained to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point we're maximizing our yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go beyond that point, we may get a
little bit more yield but the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: light that we're going to use to do that
makes it less and less efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really this becomes a consideration for
especially commercial cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Operation expenses must be reduced to
lower the overall cost and inputs to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a margin and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a paper along these same
lines that I haven't read in a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only paper I ever saw published
I believe from University of Mississippi
[SPEAKER_00]: that had essentially an efficiency study
where light intensity, CO2 level and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature were correlated and they
showed some sort of gradations that
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrated if you were going beyond
around 1000 U mol, you were seeing very
[SPEAKER_00]: nominal gains in biomass creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't phytochemical data correlated
with that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That study had a variety of issues and was
kind of the first of its kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that Allison's work is more
contemporary and they're really working
[SPEAKER_00]: with more contemporary production
technology and better cannabis chemovars
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's more interesting insight
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say is that production
variables for operational efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't necessarily the most important
targets for all of us, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeking to produce really
monumental chemotypes and really diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out really cannabis can tolerate
a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the things my friend
Bob Hoffman who's a frequent participant
[SPEAKER_00]: of Photo X says is that we've actually
made a lot of CO2 junkie plants and that
[SPEAKER_00]: we use probably more CO2 than is needed
and there's actually a negative side
[SPEAKER_00]: effect where you actually have a reduced
amount of still model development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The still mates are getting this message
in the morphological development that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're essentially not needed in such an
abundance and so you create plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to have these very,
very high CO2 environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when we're looking at light
intensity, you have to speak to the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between light and gas and
there are gas exchange equipment that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be used made by Lycor and other technology
companies that are certainly used in high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping that help you to
correlate what is the correct amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and CO2 for this particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in the future most production
facilities will have used those tools to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out very specific responses but
yeah, I hope that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and one thing you touched on that I
just want to highlight is you mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: that with dimmable lights with LEDs,
you can sort of progress the plant slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: to these target PPFD levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I've heard about LEDs and I've
never grown under LEDs, I've only grown
[SPEAKER_02]: under HPS technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to work the plant up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be very careful to slowly
raise the plant to the higher light
[SPEAKER_02]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just flip a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the both strengths and
weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people do not adopt sophisticated
strategies to incrementally graduate these
[SPEAKER_00]: curves in the production environment,
which of course we can never just look at
[SPEAKER_00]: one element in the production environment
like lighting on its own and really get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the variables move together and in
interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And correlating VPD with your light
intensity and stages of development for
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse chemovars is a lot of the art for
those of us who are working to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: novel chemovars.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assume it's a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I assume AK Frost means
it's male but this person also asked,
[SPEAKER_02]: what caused your major crashes in living
soils?
[SPEAKER_02]: You had mentioned in the last episode that
you had tried a bunch of living soils but
[SPEAKER_02]: had a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, I had some of the best
outcomes I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it was pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over time, whether there was a rice
root aphid infestation that developed even
[SPEAKER_00]: after pretty thorough entry exit protocols
and ultimately having lots of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: media and numerous vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, humans and plants are generally
the worst, but media behind that somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: or the russet mice and broad mites at some
point I found at least a population of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of those three pathogens and using
all of the bio controls that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: employing, which in a small garden,
we're talking like a 16 light garden
[SPEAKER_00]: spending around 3K for a single crop cycle
in biological pest controls that were
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective in regulating those
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just resulted in this kind of situation
that I felt the media, which I had huge
[SPEAKER_00]: root zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were one cubic yard custom designed
smart pots that four foot by four foot by
[SPEAKER_00]: four foot, working with deep rises for
dynamics and shared root zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt that if you had an entrenched
population, you could at best manage that
[SPEAKER_00]: population and many, many successful
growers continue to cultivate with root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids and other nasty pathogens that are
creating an erratic production
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can still, with a lot of intense
IPM management and focus, still get great
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is they were just so
varied and prior to the presence of those
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, I was just getting such amazing
quality of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is I think as long as
you were very stringent, like my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: David Teagaud in Canada, if you haven't
heard of him, is a brilliant grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course, I think he's been on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So David, of course, is doing living soil
at scale and has some great protocols for
[SPEAKER_00]: how to manage the issues that he's
endured.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of it, I know I'm trying to do
something that's closer to precision ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was about what your outcomes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many good ways to proceed in
cultivating cannabis, but I know I really
[SPEAKER_00]: had to adhere to something that was a
reproducible media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very consistent baseline so that I
could get to this high resolution insight
[SPEAKER_00]: with the chemovars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think for a cultivation facility
that's not so focused on science or on
[SPEAKER_02]: exact replication, like you're really
trying to pull a lot of research and data
[SPEAKER_02]: out of your facility, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think living soils does just
introduce too much variability for what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we all may die and
bring every other species with us if we do
[SPEAKER_00]: not mass adopt living soil strategies as
part of a mosaic to adapt more effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: to changing times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, again, never want to dissuade
anybody through some fearful message that
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens are uncontainable or the
erraticness of living soil is not tenable
[SPEAKER_00]: because I guarantee there's just all sorts
of incredible cannabis in grown and living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, pretty consistently at this point in
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a real differentiating
factor for commercial producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really cherish samples that are shared
with me that are produced in that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really need to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something that Jaya Palmer,
a good friend of mine, and Suzanne
[SPEAKER_02]: Wainwright-Evans really emphasize is that
we're not trying, we're not able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're not trying to eradicate these
insect populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to manage them below an
economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the facilities I work with are
dealing with these problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point in time, they got introduced
into the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's inevitable more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we can manage them effectively,
then it's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to gloat, I will say after having
endured hell, where I've of course
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered genetics from around the planet
and had a variety of medical gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've seen every imaginable pathogen I
feel at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly there are nastier
viruses out there somewhere and things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have yet to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to be overconfident, but I've endured
hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, it is remarkable to be in a
commercially focused facility with 16
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and a team of up to 40 people
coming and going, and to go for nearly an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire year with not a single pathogen,
and I'm talking not a fungus net,
[SPEAKER_00]: in an organic crop production based
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took a lot of design and
creativity and passion amongst the team to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to execute, but that is a good
feeling on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to be able to control your inputs
so tightly into those spaces is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me just to keep things moving
along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some more questions here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes to you from Lana Patrick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pronounced Lana.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said she has the opportunity to
oversee a project in a more equatorial
[SPEAKER_02]: region of our planet next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's concerned because the temperatures
are consistently around 80 degrees and the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest humidity levels are about 65%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already the draw on energy is going to be
focused on dehumidification and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and eliminate as much AC draw as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having worked as a cultivator in a large
scale facility in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have extensive experience with double
ended bulbs, but I don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of the newer LED products that
are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy briefly mentioned his success using
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm hoping for is some guidance on
the different spectrums and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: affect veg and flour and which particular
brand has worked for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had a particular trajectory
where I think I mentioned in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode that I've tried a wide array of
LEDs in the early days and like most,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're less disappointed beyond the fact
that using some deep violet and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet lights in LEDs clearly
produced more compact morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity was lacking for creating a
regenerative canopy or bloom canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that where LEDs have come to
now is just night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's incredible output.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different spectrums for
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are really at the beginning
of being able to answer which chemovars
[SPEAKER_00]: are responding to which spectra,
which stages of development and which
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That again is a lot of the art right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the blessing of working with
Fluent's bioengineering most closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been more than four-year
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they were Fluent's, they were BML.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really followed actually the CEO,
Nick Claes, who has now stepped down as
[SPEAKER_00]: they have been acquired by Osram and are
actually scaling all of the tech that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've built now into an international
presence with even greater service
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel that Fluent's has authored a
pretty unique product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other great companies in the LED
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say another name that I care
about, Neil Yorio, who is actually a past
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA scientist who founded BioSliding and
also has good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, my main experience has been
working with Fluent's tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the physio-spec spectrum
that they bring, which is based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide, has been very
successful closer to a one-size-fits-all
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral solution that you can use at
every stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great results are happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really sweet spot about
efficiency, wavelength, and intensity that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, I think the build quality is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The service the company has provided is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would say is that people who are
looking into the new lighting tech will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear a lot of things about other lighting
technologies that are potentially superior
[SPEAKER_00]: to LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't validate that I've seen any
version of a plasma light or another
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting source that is as efficient or
effective as LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, after reviewing as much of
the lighting technology as I can and have
[SPEAKER_00]: been able over the last especially five
years, I feel that LEDs are the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hort.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting more efficient,
although we've departed from Moore's law,
[SPEAKER_00]: the semiconductors are not having the same
kind of big gains they were over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new generation of Fluent's tech that
just came out is more efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: higher intensity, better formidable build
strength than anything before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're just at a place where
especially if you can find energy rebates
[SPEAKER_00]: in your local region that offset the cost
of the lights, you find that they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't get those rebates and
you have bigger capex expenditure,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you run ROI calculations on the reduced
OPEX of LEDs versus other solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies that don't wire with LEDs that
have now invested all this money into
[SPEAKER_00]: double-ended HPS and so forth,
I believe just by OPEX alone will be
[SPEAKER_00]: spending so much more to create the same
product at arguably a lower quality than
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have wired with broad
spectrum LEDs that it's going to be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference maker for whether a company is
viable or not because the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing lighting which is designed in
concert with your HVAC for controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment production is just immense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any case, starting with a call to
Fluent's would be my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation that they're not paying me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get kickbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have been well-served and learned
to use their tech in a way that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: results that surpass anything that I've
been able to achieve through other means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I joke sometimes that this is
turning into a Fluent's podcast because
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the growers that I've had on the
show are working with Fluent's in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lighting solutions that they prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know Nelson Linsley with Poetry of
Plants has done some trials using some
[SPEAKER_02]: other lights, and there is some technology
coming into that industry space,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great because I think competition
only breeds better products for growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Fluent's does a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a lot of their employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been fortunate to be able to
attend PhotoX and things like that where I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a lot of respect for the company
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people do need to do their research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's such a challenge wading through
all of the different marketing claims out
[SPEAKER_02]: there on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every LED company seems to have their own
angle, and it's really hard to know what
[SPEAKER_02]: to believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've really got to do your due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to pretend to have the
one right way because one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: about our craft is that there are just so
many ways to approach the challenges we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all confronted with as producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I will say that I've just never
had an experience with another company
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of I would I would put to the
same level of quality of service,
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of content and sort of product
innovation leaders as I've had with
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluent's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to not be passionate,
but it's hilarious when you mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: so many other people on the podcast have
also raved about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know there's other companies that are
making an effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you've mentioned, they all use
marketing language to support their sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of lighting solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really need is independent
evaluation of these attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How efficient is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How intense can it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How effective is it in using different
wavelengths and really look at these sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of in a more objective fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think actually those were the things
I looked at to evaluate Fluent's versus
[SPEAKER_00]: other fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was a clear sort of dominating
force currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new tech on the horizon
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that my friend Dan Gustafik from
Hybrid Tech has talked about frequently is
[SPEAKER_00]: that having water cooled LEDs will help
the efficiency and for vertical farming
[SPEAKER_00]: applications be an exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have looked at these kind of
fixtures and see moving parts and flowing
[SPEAKER_00]: water with electric work and plumbing
challenges and a variety of other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't so far, at least from my
perspective, justify the efficiency gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly there are all sorts of
imaginative things that will come up as
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry is going to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I hope that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to change directions
entirely with this next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Blue Dot Organics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to know when collecting pollen
from a male cannabis plant that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: selected for desired traits, hoping to be
passed on to its progeny, is there a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific period in its flowering cycle
that would statistically speaking give the
[SPEAKER_02]: best chance for passing on the desired
trait?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, using pollen that dropped
four weeks into flowering compared to six
[SPEAKER_02]: or seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would certainly say if you're
introducing male pollen earlier and then
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing is better than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say four weeks is I think a pretty
general consensus for where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: applying it because you have an
inflorescence that has made a pistol at
[SPEAKER_00]: mass that's broader than one centimeter
that now can start to receive the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you want to give maximal
opportunity for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I think a lot of us are
actually moving away from using male
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and finding advantage in using
gynecis breeding that actually is more
[SPEAKER_00]: using a solution of maybe silver sulfate
or coital silver to induce sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: diaceous tendencies, excuse me,
monaceous tendencies in a female plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the likelihood of sort of genetic
stability of the particular expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: a trait sooner than later and not kind of
have the XY chromosome come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, around four weeks is a
pretty, I think that's pretty generally
[SPEAKER_00]: what people do and that's around what I've
done in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're referring to the process known
in the industry as feminized seeds or
[SPEAKER_02]: feminizing seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that not just for the production of
seeds that produce low or no males but
[SPEAKER_00]: actually to also use that as a tool for
breeding in a targeted way to more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently get towards genetic stability
of a particular trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask one of my questions now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have you seen any level of like
chemotypic expression or chemovar
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation with pest pressure or
pathogens in terms of a plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: resist these intrusions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the interesting things
when you think about the evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: origins of secondary metabolites and
actually only in the last year did we
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from that team of scientists in
Canada, I believe that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out that a viral attack had
occurred millions of years ago that
[SPEAKER_00]: created this miraculous biosynthase in
cannabis that results in the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and goes beyond terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpenoids are largely considered
to be a part of pest defense response and
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly pest pressure and pathogen
pressure or any kind of stress has a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to the sort of expression of
a chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are all kinds of different
ways you can explore intentional stress to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance the chemovar profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even I've heard of very obscure things
like root pruning to induce stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly using mixed sort of photoperiod
rhythms, being able to induce stress
[SPEAKER_00]: through a broad array of potential
strategies is what I think is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: palette we can work with to explore the
range a single genotype can produce of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the important sense is that I
think in the old world, and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world still sees cannabis this way is sort
of, if you have this plant that makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and you have breeders who are
kind of promising that, and seed providers
[SPEAKER_00]: who say, well, these seeds are having this
ratio of CBD and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, when did you harvest
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest timing is a huge variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of chemistry you're seeing
or what level of chemo intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: what region and terroir and all of the
other influences that are contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: will have a huge amount to do with what is
evoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to pathogen pressure,
I will say that I believe some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: really high results I've seen in terpene
oils in the past, while pathogens were
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the garden like rice root
aphids actually, I saw not consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: but erratically a result that was
shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like suddenly, the near 3% oil producing
plant, which is already a high oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty monumental expression went to
nearly a 5% for a single result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could I reproduce that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was it exciting to find and to sort of
muse about the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress of the pathogen pressure and the
chemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot more work to do
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even back to an earlier question you
asked, is it ideal to have no pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if your goal is totally consistent,
phytochemical outcomes, yes, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a case to be made again for this maximal
biology for soil, food web, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: coexisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually that could be an
advantage in some situations for
[SPEAKER_00]: particular chemo of our creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we know that as a plant is naturally
senescing or completing its life cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stress can have a huge impact as it
pushes more energy into, like you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, trichome production and these
expressions of various chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99% of the industry right now is still
stressing their plants out in ways that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't fully understand and looking to
reduce plant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to see some research down
the road of targeted plant stress as if we
[SPEAKER_02]: do create this certain type of stress on
the plant at this particular stage of its
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle, we are going to see an
increase in this particular terpene or
[SPEAKER_02]: this particular cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, plant stress is a fascinating
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other important thing I think that
we should say is for all of the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and producers who might hear this,
but I know one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: things that occurred for me in the past
was when I had this run in with a director
[SPEAKER_00]: of research and a genomic company who
essentially was very, very meticulous at
[SPEAKER_00]: what she did from a sort of plant science
background and came and looked at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the observational studies I was conducting
to try to elicit these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of my process because of in her experience
using plant growth chambers with
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly exacting conditions with a
single factor that is changing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, creates really useful data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our line, I think most cannabis
growers are still looking at very
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated environments and making
correlations that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: indefensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very likely incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that these sort of assumptions and gut
feelings and loose correlations are not
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff of, say, for example,
studying a specific pathogen pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: the relationship to a chemo bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be so much work put in on the
front side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually what I feel over the last
almost two years at Proof I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on is just getting to a baseline
that we can reproduce and then control for
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to see the impact of a single
variable change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is hard and it's exhausting and
it's not rewarding and it doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of revenue or anything, but it does
give you the possibility of truly starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to correlate things in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just I guess I want to make a call
for we all have to work with a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: level of rigor than we have in the past to
really know what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of mystic farmers and
sort of, you know, like people have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of experience with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a lot of experience with the
plant, too, but I've learned that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I took as sort of the truths
that I'd experienced in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have now disproven through better
quality research and through experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: design that refutes conclusions that I had
made in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a producer could never spend
enough time on this idea of how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize experimental design so that you
can start to get high quality insight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you really care about this
thing, to know one thing really clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than many things in a kind of fuzzy
way, I would argue is probably more
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's great, because you
point out that that's really what the mind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a scientist is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not trying you have a hypothesis,
but you're not trying to lead the data or
[SPEAKER_02]: the research in any real direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have to go with where it takes
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the big takeaway from what
you're saying is that maybe as cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: and consultants and people in the industry
that work with this plant, we should be a
[SPEAKER_02]: little less confident with the claims that
we're making based on our observations,
[SPEAKER_02]: because all of our observations are,
in a sense, tainted, because there is so
[SPEAKER_02]: much variability out there in all of these
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have said what I was trying to say
far more directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is there's a like a heaping
portion of humility about what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that I want to just
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is insecurity, if you're
concerned about your future position in
[SPEAKER_00]: this space that's rapidly evolving and
you're seeing like proliferation of
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and stuff, it doesn't surprise
me that there's a temptation to
[SPEAKER_00]: overcompensate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think it's important because we
all care about serving this planet that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a measure of self reflection about
why we might compensate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on one hand, yes,
there are really people who are called to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry forth this plant and ensure that it
is available for future generations and
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest level of use and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also I need to be humble in
the face of what is such an unbelievably
[SPEAKER_00]: daunting and vast task as like actually
understanding these relationships between
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and plants and humans and their
interactions with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's really big stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a humble task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, like in science as well,
any result is a good result.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very often you don't get a
result that supports your thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more often than not, by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, being being open to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I don't think that discourages
artistry in the cannabis industry on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some people that do just have a
knack for this plant and growing this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we can't right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science can't prove all of the ideas and
principles that they're using or pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: forward or what's working for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that might be because science hasn't
caught up with them, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want people to be discouraged
just because they don't have a research
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can utilize these tools as we
grow as an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that means that the
artistry is going away by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just too much room to grow still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say the frustration that I've had
in having some media sort of exposure in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last especially few years was I get
painted as this person who only cares
[SPEAKER_00]: about science and science is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I so agree with what you just said
that, in fact, I identify as an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually identify as a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see chemistry as correlated with like,
you know, literally musical frequencies
[SPEAKER_00]: and using mix engineering model of like
lows, low mids, mid highs and highs for
[SPEAKER_00]: what you would do an audio mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that to produce chemotypes in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that I'm playing, you know,
this sort of facility as an instrument and
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's these compositions that
emerge and if I wasn't sustained by that
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper creative narrative, there is no way
I could persevere through the detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks that science demands in order to
gain clear insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anything, I'm more artist than
science, and I think most of us are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also cherish the insights of science
and the opportunities for us to serve
[SPEAKER_00]: people and this plant in ways that we've
never been able to to go much farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, do not want to dissuade anybody
from their creative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a lot of things we'll never
be able to explain that people can achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: through a miraculous relationship with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a relationship at the end of the
day, always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you mentioned something a minute
ago that I thought was really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting when you were talking
about how.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better to know one thing really,
really well than a broad general thing
[SPEAKER_02]: without a very good idea of it,
and that's that's interesting to me
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the Soil Scientist Society
meeting I was I just got back from,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was awesome, by the way,
the fact that they would even had an
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in cannabis and were willing to
have people come and speak about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my goal was really just to encourage
them to work in cannabis and see all the
[SPEAKER_02]: gaps that we have in science.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was sitting next to this young
woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a graduate student at MIT,
actually incredibly brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these soil scientists were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was asking her about her research
and she was studying the effects of iron
[SPEAKER_02]: oxide on methane production in soils and
not looking at anything to do with cattle
[SPEAKER_02]: or cow production or anything like that,
literally just the small amount of methane
[SPEAKER_02]: that's produced naturally in soils,
just this minuscule tiny bit of research
[SPEAKER_02]: that she knew really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the reasons I think
science takes so long is because we have
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I lost you, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me let me call you right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Jeremy, good to have you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new question for you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just start from scratch since I lost
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one comes from my buddy Nelson
Lindley with Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on the podcast a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He asks, with all the work being performed
by Jeremy and his associates, how can one
[SPEAKER_02]: safeguard the genetic IP intellectual
property from becoming subject to the same
[SPEAKER_02]: big pharma paradigm they're looking to
reinvent?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me just finish reading this so
you can get the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a pretty tough question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says, personally, I struggle with
bringing superior medical cultivars into
[SPEAKER_02]: the public domain without there being a
clear road map to its availability and
[SPEAKER_02]: fair access to those who are in need as
well as incentive for its caretaker and
[SPEAKER_02]: creator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second to that, there are only a few
companies like Philos who are creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: database or catalog of this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the odd speculative investment
climate in today's market is unsettling to
[SPEAKER_02]: give the keys to any castle that can be
purchased and kept at bay from all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: intentions expressed on this latest
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says, on further note,
it is always a pleasure to listen to the
[SPEAKER_02]: very articulate Jeremy Plumb, who is one
of the few individuals I have ever met
[SPEAKER_02]: that embodies the spirit of the garden and
all of his actions and is somehow able to
[SPEAKER_02]: speak for an hour straight with only a
half dozen ums or errs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am convinced you are from a future
planet and a better one at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, I have to start with
Nelson Linsley is a unique and
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievably creative force in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had the honor and privilege to
get to work with him to some limited
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, partly through the Flint community
and just so respect his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm grateful for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to think he was throwing me a
softball because he's aware that I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: co-founder of the open cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the question got a little
thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I respect this this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tiny bit about the genetic heritage
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a podcast unto itself,
really, but I do need to say a few words,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that there is a lot at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people have not woken up to the
sort of terrifying reality that in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: of federal regulation occurring,
the US Patent and Trade Office has granted
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of patents that patent experts
would consider to be weak claims and very
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely to be able to actually be
descended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that they've granted these
plants without an ability to survey all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the prior art for the plants that have
existed in the public domain, therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: not being able to differentiate what is
novel, what is actually new and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of some kind of intensive,
unique breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was just in the chemo scape,
what has been out there circulating with
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have risked their lives and in
many cases lost their lives, in many cases
[SPEAKER_00]: done jail time in order to persevere to
make sure that this plant is available for
[SPEAKER_00]: not just our generation, but future
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that especially the useful and
uniquely therapeutically active plants
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't taken offline and just a giant land
grab that then disallows this sort of folk
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine application that this is a core
theme for anybody who's involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it started to become a topic
that I was passionate about years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in part, Dr. Mowgli-Holmes,
a founder of Philos really and CEO was
[SPEAKER_00]: also incredibly concerned with this and
actually started all of the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I recognized that after I saw the
initial patents being accepted,
[SPEAKER_00]: that even though I didn't have time to do
this work and like everybody else is
[SPEAKER_00]: really busy, that I had to allocate focus
towards ensuring that we have a response
[SPEAKER_00]: in defense of the plant and in defense of
all the people who should be able to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the open cannabis project, I am no
longer on the board for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stepped down in December that has an
amazing executive director named Beth
[SPEAKER_00]: Schechter and this world-class board,
including people from technology and legal
[SPEAKER_00]: space who are eminently qualified to
address these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advise everybody who cares to
actually support that effort both in money
[SPEAKER_00]: and time and to chime in with Beth and
find out how to support that effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a historic moment where
there is a juncture that is like never
[SPEAKER_00]: been afforded another industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the opportunity to protect all of
that prior art and to ensure those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are made available for future generations
and not just see it kind of disappear in
[SPEAKER_00]: the land grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really big deal, but it takes
a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The approach they've taken is to create
the world's largest database of chemotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: and also genetic data to be able to help
define the prior art and then to relate
[SPEAKER_00]: with USPTO and others as an advocacy
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many other initiatives,
but it's just exciting to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone after being the executive
director for a couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping get it off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just simply couldn't continue to be
involved with so many efforts and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: have to focus on my work here at Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what is going on in terms of the
genetic space that I think is most
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other teams like Strainly in
Canada that are working in a similar way
[SPEAKER_00]: for open source plant, creative common
style, intellectual property protections,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's another important effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, I'm biased and believe
you should check out Hogan Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to his notion about the plants that
are special, you have to be very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: with how they come forward because they
could quickly get hoovered up into some
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem that does not have the public
benefit and interest of the whole in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: and heart and that really does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work very hard to find relationships
with people that have demonstrated ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the complexity of the cannabis
industry, which there's no sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: just black and white for me in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hugely challenging frontier that
we're all operating in and working to
[SPEAKER_00]: build relationships that matter and that
are forged based on shared ethics is
[SPEAKER_00]: really an important part of the work that
I do and I try my damnedest to uphold
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, like everybody, we're all
occasionally put into a position that's
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable around having to navigate
our own needs, the needs of the company
[SPEAKER_00]: we're serving potentially and the needs of
a growing market and the needs of a future
[SPEAKER_00]: generation that's yet to arrive that we
want to see get more benefit than ours did
[SPEAKER_00]: from this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any magic formulas or
recipes or pretend to have some high
[SPEAKER_00]: ground as much as it is a sincere effort
that has been lifelong for me and having
[SPEAKER_00]: always been in a kind of activist position
in this space as well as in a creative and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific discovery position,
I feel an obligation to try to bring what
[SPEAKER_00]: eldership I can to the younger people that
are now having opportunities to make big
[SPEAKER_00]: impact and intellectual property and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say we need to get therapeutic
plants out now that are not just type one,
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC, nursing dominant, sort of core
user profiles and that is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mission that we're doing at Proof is
to really resource a huge amount of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like what my friend Mojave
called and Big Sur, the early moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, high terpenaline profiles that
actually were a very important part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole community who was at the ground zero
of cannabis coming through the US that
[SPEAKER_00]: really went away when we got into this
high THC type one nursing stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: great for what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one note and there's this entire
spectrum that we can be addressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very important to now
partner with clinical research to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to differentiate these new profiles in
terms of the incredible therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: actions they can provide and the quality
of life boom they offer and that that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: central mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So withholding special plants from the
market only to try to protect them when
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't even been substantiated has
other issues but finding ways to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them forward with agreements that feel
like they're able to protect the best
[SPEAKER_00]: interests of both the humanity and the
more than human world as well as companies
[SPEAKER_00]: prerogative to make profit and try to
survive an unbelievably challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: startup industry as a startup company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's challenging stuff and I know I have
a lot to learn and am constantly striving
[SPEAKER_00]: to find other people who can help to shine
light on that forward path and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: strived to do that for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm missing some other part of his
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you feel that I've
adequately spoken to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I enjoyed what you said and I would
agree that I think I met Beth briefly at
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a wonderful human being.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time chatting with her and
I'm hoping to get her and also the people
[SPEAKER_02]: over at Candor over on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't scheduled with them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing something really interesting
from her herbarium perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess the question I would ask you
based on this is in your own experience
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with proof and with phylose,
what happens when you do get that special
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you are beholden to investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a for-profit business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet I know you have this passion about
preserving and sharing these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you balance that between
profitability and sort of your own values
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of how this plant should be
shared?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say is that it was a
miracle that I found the team that I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I found a team that was willing to
entertain the notion that we could do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to transform the space that we're in
and was willing to take risks and to go up
[SPEAKER_00]: the steep hill and to pursue challenging
terrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want just the lowest
hanging fruit, which is all the immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: near-term revenue targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't an easy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe there are a ton of teams
that are like that in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very challenging when you're living
hand to mouth to have the ambition to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a difference in kind of the larger
trajectory of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that at scale is, I mean,
it is been quite an intense experience to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to be responsible for the various
needs and to both have a profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: endeavor that can survive and exist in the
world and be supported through doing
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful service and providing a product
mix and sort of perspectives that really
[SPEAKER_00]: help people and help this whole thing to
go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to keep my eye on the core values that
I have always lived with in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel the plant itself is arguably
the best teacher of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I'll say personally
about how the plant helps me to navigate
[SPEAKER_00]: this is that there's a reflective quality
in those first moments of a euphoric state
[SPEAKER_00]: where some kind of useful chemistry has
been ingested and then there's quiet and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an opportunity to evaluate the
things that have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's I wronged somebody in a
relationship that was a subtle thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the moment I was going 60 miles an
hour and I did not observe the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: which that had impact on another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have an opportunity to pick
that up, to kind of keep relatively clear
[SPEAKER_00]: in the relationships that I meant by
virtue of using the chemistry the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I think that is easily one of the
most useful tools because reflective time
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that's rare and are very,
very busy life that actually affords us
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to live more wholly,
to be responsible for the expressions that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're involved with, still continuing to
persevere with ethics and style and
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity and to not just be purely
self-interested or ever in a position of
[SPEAKER_00]: harming others intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to then pick up if unintentional harm
has occurred, the responsibility in the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think without the plant, I would never
be able to sustain the pressure cooker
[SPEAKER_00]: that is this kind of modern cannabis
industry unfurling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the core guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like there really isn't a
clear path at this point, even within or
[SPEAKER_02]: for you and your company in terms of
exactly what will happen when that special
[SPEAKER_02]: plant does come along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I missing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm hearing all of your passion
and love for cannabis and I know you to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a very ethical person and I love
everything you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering, is there like a
concrete way for people to preserve that
[SPEAKER_02]: in your eyes or have you established one
for proof where when that holy grail of a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant comes along that could transform
medicine or do whatever, what's your
[SPEAKER_02]: roadmap to balance that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it doesn't exist yet is what I'm
hearing possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that I don't believe actually there's
going to be a plant that's the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that there's such a broad
range of genetic diversity as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: how extensively the plant has been
outbred, especially on the West coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: just how many different things it can do
for how many different kinds of people
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrate that it's just tremendously
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one item.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, I think anything that we find
that's useful, especially in this early
[SPEAKER_00]: age of finally having chemical analytic
tools to do an inventory of the chemoscape
[SPEAKER_00]: is really a potential that must be
improved upon in order to develop into a
[SPEAKER_00]: more mature, therapeutic, useful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think clinical researchers are the
ground zero of illustrating the relevance
[SPEAKER_00]: of a particular chemo bar in improving
quality of life for a targeted group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like Dr. Eddie Poe and Dr.
Ethan Russo and Dr. David Marie and others
[SPEAKER_00]: are really at the front lines of being
able to vindicate the utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inherently, because they're working on
those things, not just in private
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, but also in public interest
research, there is a sort of opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: where as the insight becomes made clear by
virtue of, say, we've read Ethan Russo's
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper and start to see, gosh,
there's areas over here that we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing more research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that numerous producers around the
world may have access to things that have
[SPEAKER_00]: similar inventory and all collectively,
like good science, get to work on those
[SPEAKER_00]: potentials, whether they're siloed and
purely in their individual process or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're collaborative and have networked
scientific organizations, as we'd hope to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, I think, how insight
continues to bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in the cannabis space,
especially with people who've been
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-generational and who really distrust
corporations and distrust capitalism,
[SPEAKER_00]: rightfully so, there's a lot of sort of
trauma that has to be digested in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue the most useful expressions of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we withhold the one special thing
and don't actually figure out ways by
[SPEAKER_00]: which to serve a lot of people with that
to demonstrate its specialness,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we're helping to protect
the plant or if we're actually keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: offline something that might really make a
difference in the world's view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel actually the most important work is
around storytelling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that those of us who are able
to work in that space of innovation and
[SPEAKER_00]: research are creating fruit that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the world still sees this as a
drug that's harmful and it's coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition era branding exercise that
lasted for decades, that continues to
[SPEAKER_00]: create all kinds of stigma and resistance
between people having a correct
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with this plant, which
there's no human or there's no mammal that
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be interested in the potential
of modulating the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: in meaningful ways to increase the quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we have a very limited sort of
cross-section of the culture so far who's
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you see with hemp and CBD,
a broad and growing adopting sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective that the chemistry in cannabis
is really meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just have so far to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that there's a kind of
humility in recognizing how early stage we
[SPEAKER_00]: are to sort of more broadly experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one other thing I'll say, a plus
point, is that I was really disappointed
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon when I was working with a
variety of other groups that were very
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically inspired and focused on
cannabis to create this OHUB campus that
[SPEAKER_00]: was initially, I think, going to be a site
for state-funded research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually a cannabis research
panel that was authored, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was in, well, I don't know the exact
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the beginning of regulation in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, a variety of people were
brought forward and told the state that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should allocate, and Mowgli-Holmes was
really one of the people at the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but other people I know,
Ethan Russo was part of this, said you
[SPEAKER_00]: should really consider allocating 1% of
your tax revenue, reinvest that into
[SPEAKER_00]: public benefit research as a means of
substantiating this economy that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's speculating on being so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even that got shot down, never
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be state-sanctioned and
supported research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be public interest research,
or what universities do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go talk to academics in the space,
like chemists, and Israel named Lumiere,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's just happy to share everything he can
about what he's doing and why he's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to meet others who are doing it
so he can do it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so unfortunate that instead of
having any kind of public benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: research, other than few exceptions,
we see this ecosystem of walled garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate, self-interest-focused research
for their own benefit and their own
[SPEAKER_00]: products and making claims that are
dubious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really frustrating because,
of course, this is a plant that should be
[SPEAKER_00]: serving everybody that is something that
is certainly in public benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do not have in any of the early
regulatory programs something akin to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you continue to see University of
Mississippi mailing our friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last in the medical program,
a series of joints that are 2% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't see this shared collective
interest research happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of opportunities to
actually find wins and to build gain in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be on people's minds,
but it shouldn't only be companies doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what companies have to do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that everybody in my position
or anybody who's working in a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: company has to balance how they're going
to approach that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we found that proof,
an amazing ability to really thread that
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that inspires me and keeps me
very interested in the future and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do for people, not just in our local
region, but around the planet with insight
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocacy and expertise that we've also
funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know others that are not so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to continue to practice
their craft within a company that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to support those same outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know others who don't have the support
of any company who are working
[SPEAKER_00]: passionately on those outcomes but are
doing it in a marginalized scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so small and it's so expensive and
it's so challenging to produce meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: results that actually make a difference
for meaningful plants at a tiny scale when
[SPEAKER_00]: now there's been this era of mergers and
acquisitions and market consolidation and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're moving to stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, you have to find a team that can
support it, but then can you find a team
[SPEAKER_00]: with ethics that shares this public
benefit perspective to the extent that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have got?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so rare, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the heartbreaking part of all this
is that we know we could do so much
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if there were 50 universities in
the US with each having a department like
[SPEAKER_00]: in Israel, a research grade academic
supported department working together for
[SPEAKER_00]: the best interest for the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one year, we would have a very
different relationship with the same ship
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea around intellectual property that
Nelson brings up is a really challenging
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole podcast and it's not
something that can be easily answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I didn't do the best job
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much I'm not saying I would
like to say, but it literally is a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you get to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Beth is a great start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to just say the other thing you
brought up that I think is really
[SPEAKER_02]: important is that we are really in the
infancy with this plant and what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: learning about this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The research that you're doing is really
at the frontier of where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for all the work you do
for sharing this information with growers
[SPEAKER_02]: and listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can stay in touch and continue
to learn from each other as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad, thank you for building an epic
platform to have sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations about just sound bites and
for all the great people and content
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already brought forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really look forward to you
continuing to help people to see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nuance and intricacy in this space so
we can all respond more effectively to the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Jeremy Plum, Director of
Production Science at Proof cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've posted a ton of links and information
relating to this podcast right on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast page at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just click on the podcast menu at the top
of the home screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you next time.
