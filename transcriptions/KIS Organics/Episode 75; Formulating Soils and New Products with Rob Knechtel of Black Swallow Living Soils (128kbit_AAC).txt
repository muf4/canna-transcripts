[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Rob Nechtel,
founder of Black Swallow Living Soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although Rob's lifelong interest in
growing cannabis began in the late 60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: he has spent the past 45 years in a
completely unrelated industry designing,
[SPEAKER_01]: installing, and marketing fireplaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the Canadian government announced
approximately five years ago that they
[SPEAKER_01]: would be legalizing cannabis production,
Rob, his wife Lou, and son Nathan decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to start up Black Swallow Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nathan runs the day-to-day operations with
his team and Rob, along with his wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to concentrate on further
building the Black Swallow brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: After meeting on a visit to Gold Leaf
Gardens a few years ago, Rob and Nathan
[SPEAKER_01]: began to work on a couple projects with
Kiss Organics and now blend the Kiss mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: based off of my formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a relatively short time, Black Swallow
Living Soil has gained significant
[SPEAKER_01]: recognition as a respected supplier of
organic soil amendments and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies in Canada, which they ship coast
to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this podcast, we discuss exactly what
goes into formulating a soil mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as some of the challenges we see
on a daily basis in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Rob, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you are the owner of Black
Swallow Living Soils up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to listeners a little bit
about yourself, a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of the company, where you're
located in Canada, some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so located first in southern Ontario
in Brantford, which is a number of your
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners will know as the home of Wayne
Gretzky, but also part of a pretty serious
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Black Swallow came out of
conversations between myself and my son
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan, who runs the business with me,
and this is prior to Trudeau's
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement that Canada was going to be
embracing legalization and we saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to get an amendment input
supply company up and running and started
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the program together at that point
in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the first bit was pretty
lean, but since that time, the business
[SPEAKER_00]: has grown considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had some other experience in
running businesses in other markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to just touch on that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Black Swallow is really our second
business, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 40 years experience in a
completely unrelated industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fireplace industry, where we do some
OEM manufacturing for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fireplace manufacturers and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also gave us a pretty good experience
in terms of moving products around,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, globally as well as North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helped out when we wanted to get
Black Swallow up and running because
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the single biggest challenge that
we faced initially was just trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian sources for our products,
pulling products out of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: just alone because of the Canadian dollar
difference, but also because the border
[SPEAKER_00]: and shipping and all this sort of thing is
not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to find Canadian sourced products
and that took a tremendous amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy in the initial early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our ability to move products and know
how to do that certainly played to our
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage in those days as well as moving
forward in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that logistics thing is huge
because it's something that we still
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the biggest headache that we have is
dealing with logistics, especially right
[SPEAKER_01]: now with COVID going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your ability to move things across
borders, I think, is a huge advantage for
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys in your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to touch on is you offer
a lot of the same or similar types of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic amendments as what we carry here
in the United States with Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're shipping them all over Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are also the distributors and
Canadian distributors for fertile pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had William on the podcast with
fertile pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the biodegradable pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys work with grassroots pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You carry and stock blue mat supplies for
people up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also make soils, which is one of the
reasons I wanted to have you on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast today was to talk about soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I started working together three
or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you when you guys came down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You toured Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had went to a few other facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to have lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fun day to get to meet you guys
in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take me through a little bit of your soil
formulation process because the main point
[SPEAKER_01]: of this podcast will be to talk about soil
formulation and then the process you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: went to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go a little bit before that because
I know you were making other soils as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we start there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that too was a bloody nose
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inevitably run up against the wall a
few times in terms of trying to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: the best recipe that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had had decades of experience,
sort of my own personal growing
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, thought that I understood
soils and plant needs and soil science and
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly realized that what I knew was
miles away from what current soil science,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is today, spent an awful lot of
time reading and studying and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: courses and whatnot and started off with a
formula that would be, or is frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as a Clackamascoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Clack came out with a recipe that
had a lot of mileage and tried variations
[SPEAKER_00]: on that theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And went through the process of doing the
soil analysis from batch to batch and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to gently tweak the recipe forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought that we had a reasonable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did have a reasonable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after meeting yourself and being
able to talk to someone who had
[SPEAKER_00]: considerably greater depth of experience
with blending soils, I learned quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were quite interested in working
with us to develop our version of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: have called, in recognition of your input,
the KISS mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say our version, that means
that I'm taking into consideration the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that we have considerable different
geographical availability of products and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes no sense trying to duplicate when
certain products that you would use in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mix are not necessarily available
here in southern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, rock dusts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the proximity to the Canadian
shield, we have some pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust in Ontario that we had ready
access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas things like pumice, which is
apparently quite readily available in your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard, we have to bring that in by the
truckload either from the States or from
[SPEAKER_00]: BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an aeration concept, it's not really
a contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I refer to as sort of a luxury
amendment because of the shipping costs
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not practical to use
something like that in a standard mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to work with pricing and
availability and do the vetting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: various different inputs that we have to
ensure that we got the best bang for the
[SPEAKER_00]: buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current KISS mix has been on the
market now for four years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to four years and has proven to be
very successful for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been quite a pleasure to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just going back, I do want to touch on
the KOOT mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people have had really
good success with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly nothing wrong with that
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I would like to highlight in
regards to that is that KOOT himself has
[SPEAKER_01]: always said you're not growing in KOOT mix
if you're not using his earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, which obviously are not
available commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes a big difference,
too, in terms of the overall quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to throw that out there for
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also that, yeah, we started
talking about formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you were working with another
agronomist there and had a mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you weren't completely satisfied with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you and I talked about
collaborating on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and I kind of want to talk about that
process for people because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people that make their own soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think understanding what we went
through to formulate this soil together,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think might be a useful exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you mentioned was
sourcing products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the sustainability and
availability of these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: pumice that aren't as locally available,
we had to say, OK, well, what other
[SPEAKER_01]: products could we use in this case?
[SPEAKER_01]: We may want to use pumice, but it's not
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of frayed is too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to raise the cost of the soil
more than the value that the pumice was
[SPEAKER_01]: providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to kind of talk through some
of the inputs in that regard?
[SPEAKER_01]: You introduced me to some new rock dust
I'd never heard of that I had to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that was a steep ladder to
climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to just buy from,
you know, where products were available
[SPEAKER_00]: through some distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to just buy from the
distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to make Black Swallow work,
we knew that we had to buy from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, the producers of these various
amendments, wherever and whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that involved a fair amount of
vetting, of various suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually traveled to a couple of
different provinces on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different occasions to visit different
facilities to see what they had to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to weigh one producer against
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also meant taking samples of these
products and having them lab tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot in some cases to test for heavy
metals and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the other big challenges
that we were up against was, I know when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were out there on the West Coast,
I was gobsmacked at the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural awareness between organic
benefits, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going into a grocery store,
not too far from you, and where here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario, you would have a, you know,
regular grocery store, you'd have a small
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of the grocery store that would be
selling organic food and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to be just the complete reverse,
that the entire grocery store was filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with organic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed as if there was a tiny
corner where regular non-organic foods
[SPEAKER_00]: were sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm exaggerating to some extent,
but it just seemed to be that obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, even trying to find a quality
supplier of, you mentioned worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Clack produces, and he certainly is a
master of worm casting production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very difficult in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is only one casting supplier
that can produce any sort of volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really done as a by-product,
or it had been done until only very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, as a by-product of their bait
worm industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have since turned that around and are
committed now to quality casting
[SPEAKER_00]: production and are doing a good job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's only really one game in the
province.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost, I visited numerous different
farms and talked to numerous different
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers of compost in an effort to track
down as high a quality of compost as I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew we wanted to have and should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to suppliers of kelp products,
talking to some of the fish factories
[SPEAKER_00]: about their crab meal suppliers,
and what not, it took a lot of vetting and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of research to get to the point
where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of glad those days are over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember starting KISS with the idea
because of, well, two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I wanted to be able to make soil at
home, and I didn't need a 50-pound bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp meal or neem cake or whatever
particular input it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted like three pounds, because I was
only growing a few plants at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw this sort of like need in the
industry at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's multiple companies doing
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're kind of doing that now up in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't a lot of amendment suppliers
at the moment, but I'm sure there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: on their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of work to get something
like this up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your logistics background,
I think, helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did touch on a couple of things that I
wanted to talk a little bit more in depth
[SPEAKER_01]: on, one of which was the sourcing of the
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to formulating soils,
I really think, at least with potting
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, living soils, that's where you need
to start, is with your compost or your
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings, because you're really
formulating around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the product that's going to
determine how much of these other inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to put into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the highest quality source you can get
and afford, I recommend that to people as
[SPEAKER_01]: their starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also touched on heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I asked you for was
the heavy metal analysis of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: products, especially the compost and the
rock dusts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything mined as a potential source of
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you guys do heavy metal testing up
in Canada, just like we do in most states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, those are all very,
very real concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know for a fact that heavy metals
awareness in your marketplace is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: common than it is here in large parts of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's inevitable that it's coming,
and we want to be able to answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions when they're asked of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have already done the homework to
ensure that we have no concerns there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products with compost, as you well know,
unfortunately a lot of people who look at
[SPEAKER_00]: compost as simply a broken down organic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others look at it strictly from its
ability to supplement the fertility needs
[SPEAKER_00]: of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at it strictly from a
nutritional analysis point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the game that we're playing here,
it's the biology contribution as well that
[SPEAKER_00]: is, if not even more critical,
that needs to be in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of boxes to have to check
off when the industry is really only
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the very early game here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with a couple of compost
producers, for instance, that recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: this and are working really hard to get
their product up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have done a great job of moving their
game forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of conversations along the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of actionable information for
users, when I started working with Rob on
[SPEAKER_01]: this, having already formulated the mix
that we use here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: which took me probably five or six years
to really nail down, this process with Rob
[SPEAKER_01]: took two to three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could have done it faster,
but we're both running businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else that takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a period of time that goes
into researching and going through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so starting off with a base mix,
we were looking at peat moss perlite only
[SPEAKER_01]: because of its ability to source and cost
versus other aeration amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in this case, three types of
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had access to a nice fish compost,
a leaf compost, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a good source of that here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some worm casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the peat and the three compost
sources, that's really where we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the biological aspect of our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I'm thinking of formulating
soils, I'm looking at three things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the physical properties of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be how well does it
drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's its CEC?
[SPEAKER_01]: How well does it hold nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's its water saturation capacity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those sorts of aspects of a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I want to think about the
biological aspects, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology we're going to have here
because that's what's going to cycle the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where having a few different
diverse sources is going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also sources that are high in
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think I had you send me samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at them at the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also had some that had some
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to at least see some numbers
on that side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately, the last pillar is
the chemical properties or the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: content of these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I had all of that, then we could
start thinking about what other things we
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to add into the soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That structure is probably deservedly the
number one position in terms of that list
[SPEAKER_00]: of qualities you want to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our original mixes that we started out
with for aeration, we were using rice
[SPEAKER_00]: hulls and thought that was a pretty
reasonable mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aeration option forests and had the
benefits of the broken down into silica
[SPEAKER_00]: content and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we learned after some struggles that
rice hulls, although not bad, not
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly mixed into that mix,
blended in, then it would tend to direct
[SPEAKER_00]: water into certain channels within the
soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would leave some dry pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that created some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was that trial and error
process of having to look at whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: were attempting to do with this objective
lens as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, decided that perlite
really was going to be the superior
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration offering given the range of
options to forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, we've now got an addition
of a horse compost to our mix that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that makes that compost that we
discovered not too long ago just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely lives, breathes, and eats
compost making.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was studying under Elaine Ingham 12,
14 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he makes a tremendous product with all
the inputs from his own farm and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a trial and error process
at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know a lot of people will go a
third, a third, a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a third peat, a third compost,
and a third aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to lean towards closer to 20% on
the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still go about 33%, 34% of some sort
of aeration amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest of that is typically
peat moss in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that mix for its ability to
retain water and have good aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people I know successfully
grow with that third, third, third ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of your starting base mix
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, we start adding
these other amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the first time I sent you a
recipe, you were shocked because it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: much more than anyone else had recommended
putting into a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about a little of your
experience there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely was more than our
recipes that we were using at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we certainly gave it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proof was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think today our mix has 19 different
amendments into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do go, I think, a little heavier on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more rock-dust contribution
than you do, again, because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we have ready access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices are reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the complexity of the product,
I think, just enhances its performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of the product is lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people who are jumping into growing
in soil for the first time struggle a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: with being able to get their soil to the
proper moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add yucca to assist in that as a
surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take a little bit of work to
get the moisture levels, rehydrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to the ideal level that the grower
wants to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just takes patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller doses of watering with a bit of
time in between to allow it to get
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next watering is much more
efficient in terms of penetrating that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've gotten that understanding
of how to maintain the moisture levels
[SPEAKER_00]: that you feel your plants require,
then it becomes a pretty painless process,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're using something like
blue mats to help in that irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you brought up a good point
regarding moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So optimally with these soils,
we want to keep the moisture fairly even
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to avoid these wet-dry cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And peat moss is naturally very
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you mix the soils there on the
facility, can you talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: that process in terms of the watering
component and that heating and cooling,
[SPEAKER_01]: that almost thermal composting process
from all the nutrients that we're adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, again, that too was its own
steep learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off doing a lot of the soil
mixer and started to learn how to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to that soil mixer itself,
which was very limiting in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of materials that we could
produce at any particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even handling the when you poured in
some of the dry ingredients, and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you added the compost and when you added
everything else was problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shut the machine down so many times and
had to dig the material out because it
[SPEAKER_00]: balled up on us or just slogged down the
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've since moved on from a soil mixing
system to our current method of blending
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also allowed us to do a much
larger quantity at a single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has helped keep up with the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that here in Ontario, although
we're on a similar sort of level with
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves, latitudinally, I guess that
is, but I think our winters are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more intense and we have a big problem
with this time of year and the freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to make as much soil as we
possibly can in the fall to guide us
[SPEAKER_00]: through the winter because everything
freezes on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough indoor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to store vast quantities of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we make up all our soils,
we leave it outside, leave it exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the elements, tote it up and find that we
have to bring those frozen totes in and
[SPEAKER_00]: saw them out before we can start packaging
up that material or shipping it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a bit of a juggle trying to
learn how to manage the soil production as
[SPEAKER_00]: it was increasing relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to the time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to squeak by last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we'll make it through this
winter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits spring running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that as soon as it gets mild
enough in the product side, that we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: right back out there mixing soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to highlight for people
making soils themselves is that if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: add a large amount of nutrients when
mixing the soil, or these amendments,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the microbes in your soil are going
to start breaking them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria and archaea are going to
reproduce quite rapidly causing the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exothermic reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to plant into it right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually, you want the nutrients to
begin cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll go through this period where
you mix everything and two, three days
[SPEAKER_01]: later, the soil starts to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep that moisture content
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of access to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets above 131 degrees, you'll kill
off any weed seeds that you had in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize I'm talking to a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the conversion for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get above 131 Fahrenheit,
it'll kill off all the pathogens and weed
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in your mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it below 160 to keep all the
beneficials alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And treat it like you would almost a
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would turn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would heat up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over the period, of the next week
or so, given enough access to oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the right moisture, that soil will sort of
stabilize back at ambient air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you're ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people try and skip this step,
or I've had guys put their soil into
[SPEAKER_01]: rubber-made totes with no holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it turns into this stinky,
smelly mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referred to as the cooking
process, I think is the common term that
[SPEAKER_00]: people like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an absolutely critical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is relative, I think, to the quantities
that you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for a guy who's got four or
five-gallon pots, and he's mixing together
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 gallons of soil, he's not going to get
that temperature spike in the steaming
[SPEAKER_00]: pile that a guy who's making a couple
yards or a driveway full of soil is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to factor, especially if
you're going to be planting directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: this material with your clones or starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to make the mistake of
having too hot a soil, because the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just won't survive in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, as you stated, you've got the
advantage of that biology that has already
[SPEAKER_00]: changed much of the available nutrition
that's in lots of the soil mixed into a
[SPEAKER_00]: more plant-available, bio-available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading an article that John Kemp
had written once, and he pointed out that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really what happens in our spring
when the weather gets warm again and
[SPEAKER_00]: things start growing and you get that
incredible flush of green growth that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large part of that is directly
attributable to the fact that over the
[SPEAKER_00]: depth of that winter, the winter months,
the biology has kept on working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been making the transformation of the
soil into that bio-available form that as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as it gets warm again and the seeds
begin to sprout, that the plant can take
[SPEAKER_00]: this tremendous advantage of and has great
nutritional resources for that spring
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening in your soil as
you're mixing it up, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to duplicate that,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think recognizing temperature as a
factor is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really cold out, things are going
to go slower than if it's really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to reproduce as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in that smaller pot, let's say,
like you mentioned in that first
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, while it may not heat up,
it's still going to take a little while to
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after mixing, I still like to wait a
week or so, even in the smaller containers
[SPEAKER_01]: before planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, seedlings, rooted clones don't
need that much nutrition initially when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're first getting started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people sometimes overdo it right
at the beginning and slow things down a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit in terms of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely use a lighter mix until
the plant's really got some established
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people ask us if we've got a good
seed start mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we just tell them, no,
just take 50% of the kiss mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% peat and dilute it accordingly,
blend it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you a pretty good balance for
most seed starts, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need, in fact, a lot of
nutrition at that front end can work
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to modify that to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question that we get asked a lot
is, I'm not ready to use my soil right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that if they have to leave
the soil for months at a time before
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to plant into it,
will the soil deteriorate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it lose its viability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, of course, it does not do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply storing the soil, people say,
well, okay, if we store it in our basement
[SPEAKER_00]: or in our garage and whatnot, and we point
out to them, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, what you want to do is keep it
outside, keep it in the elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it where at least it's going to get
the moisture from the rains and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it someplace where it's
underneath a downspout sort of thing where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting all the nutrients flushed out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rain and the snow and whatnot is
actually good for that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a negative impact on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always tell people in terms of
storage is to treat the soil like it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, you're maintaining the
moisture content where it needs to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that soil is going to stay more
fertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do warn people to avoid leaching of
nutrients if they want that soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain the same fertility, because
certain things are going to leach out
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen and potassium are the two main
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sodium will leach out, which is a good
thing in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why, for example, if you get a
standard soil test, for your field soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to give you a nitrogen
recommendation on there, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to assume that, especially here in
the Pacific Northwest, that rain has
[SPEAKER_01]: leached all the available nitrogen or
nitrates out of the soil, and you really
[SPEAKER_01]: need to add those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one caution I would have for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to store your soil and it
is getting leached, do plan on adding at
[SPEAKER_01]: least some of those more mobile cations
back into the soil prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to throw a compost tea or a handful
of alfalfa meal, maybe a diluted molasses
[SPEAKER_01]: water rinse, just something to get the
biology up and active again.
[SPEAKER_01]: A week or two prior do I plan on using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right, the majority of the
nutrients are staying put.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil store is just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does great in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microbes are very resilient,
whether they insist or go dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're surviving the process,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've adapted to a lot of the conditions
that you described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, don't throw away your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about in your market area?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen references to vegan-only soil
mixes, where some people are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about the ethical versus the
pragmatic amendment usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, someone who is concerned about
that sort of thing is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reluctant to perhaps use blood,
bone, and feather meal in their soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a significant aspect of your
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently, as of like last week,
talking to one facility in Oklahoma that
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to move towards a vegan soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, that's absolutely something
I'd be happy to help you with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that believe in
growing using vegan inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a strong opinion either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not personally a vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I respect people that are in that life
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain things that are and are
not allowed in vegan production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that list sometimes gets a little
murky in the sense that some vegans are
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think, with the use of insect poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other people are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthworm casting seemed to be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's a manure product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were me, where I would draw the
line, if I really wanted to take a stand
[SPEAKER_01]: on this, I would look at our industrial
food chain and say, I don't want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that comes from slaughterhouses
or from our fisheries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, to me, is a more sustainable
approach to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could absolutely formulate around
these challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to raise the cost in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you still need all your major
micro and macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant still needs these elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you getting them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most vegan sources are quite low in
some of these specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a little harder to track down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to get nitrogen and
phosphorus from some of these animal-based
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't want to be making the
argument one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also am aware that if we can't use
these waste products, the bone meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feather meal, for instance,
tremendous, tremendous amount of feather
[SPEAKER_00]: meal from the poultry industries and the
blood meal and whatnot, then the only
[SPEAKER_00]: other real alternative is it just becomes
landfill, I guess, at some level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can take those products and turn
them into our soil, let the biology work
[SPEAKER_00]: on them and translate and transform them
into vital plant growth substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I think that needs to be factored
into some of these discussions,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, vegans won't use honey in a
lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They consume honey because that's the
manipulation or exploitation of honeybees,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we form a symbiotic
relationship with, one could argue,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of species to species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a blog post that lists a bunch
of vegan inputs for people that want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a vegan soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a good starting point on our
blog page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working on a new mix right now
here in the US that would be more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable using, I've cut out a lot of
those major inputs trying to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As something for growers, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking through the list of questions
that I have from you that we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want to touch at all on this idea
of water only?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's something that I think you
get asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you consider these soils water only?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are growers using the soil mix in most
of the situations in the growers that you
[SPEAKER_01]: work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, water only is a term that I
get hung up on a little bit at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, I use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, water only implies that the soil
has the ideal blend of all the various
[SPEAKER_00]: different nutrients that the plant is
going to need from sprout to harvest in
[SPEAKER_00]: the balance and the ratios and the ideal
ratios that it's going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: irrelevant or completely independent of
the genetic needs of that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge demand to put upon any
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water only, I think, comes into play for
people who are starting out on their first
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow a very decent harvest by
just simply maintaining the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture level of their soil and giving
their plant the water that it requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll do very well with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also plenty of growers who
have gotten beyond that who are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: capable that they understand perhaps the
particular genetics that they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nutritional demands of that
particular strain or variety that might
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance its growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're capable of adding the extra
teas, the maybe top dressings at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the plant growth and that sort of
thing to further tweak that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that sometimes water only,
it just needs that extra context of that
[SPEAKER_00]: term, that it's great as a sort of an
overall approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not to say that you can't move
beyond that and be more target specific in
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just comes from an experienced
gardener's approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know when I first started with
this, what's now called living soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going for something with the idea
being that if you were a medical or cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, you can walk into a grow store
and get a bag of soil and walk out and
[SPEAKER_01]: just water your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really more about simplicity
rather than maybe what's optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we're talking about people
using it in facilities, commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at more sophisticated ways,
I do think small inputs that are targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: at stages of growth can increase your
overall yield and fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, for me, water only started
because of sort of that concept more so
[SPEAKER_01]: than necessarily maximizing yield or
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go water and still get a
really good looking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not off the table if that's the
level of horticulture that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we mentioned clax mix,
but there are other mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can Google soil recipes and
there are thousands of them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, just slight variations of
similar themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, there are a number of recipes
out there too that took sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite approach where they tried to
throw absolutely everything at their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of what I call the kitchen
sink approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spoke a moment ago about the
complexity of the kicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss mix by comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in the earlier days of soil
recipes, soil making, they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw everything at that soil with the
attitude that the more the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, fortunately
today we've got an understanding of where
[SPEAKER_00]: that happy medium space is, where you do
have some sort of disciplined approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutritional profile that you're
building in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just letting that work its magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to caution folks in the idea
that yes, you can put a lot into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it needs to be balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to be balanced around your
compost sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see these recipes online,
and I've seen thousands by now in all
[SPEAKER_01]: these forums, what they're not taking into
account is that you're probably not using
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same compost sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really throws off the mix because
that's what you're formulating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people need to be aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just about any recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be formulated around what you
have and what you're using on that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that that I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in terms of complexity,
it's really all about balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we haven't talked
about yet is when we first mix the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you send off samples for lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got those back and then we just started
tweaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have you make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would take that mix, mix it up again,
send those off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took quite a few tests before we
got to a point where I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, this this looks right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's start doing plant trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is the mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing is the testing until you
feel like you've hit that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like the numbers and then you get into
plant trials at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a process, you know,
and it is it cost some money to to get you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't hit it right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think with some experience and
having formulated a lot of soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: it allowed us to start a little bit closer
maybe to our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you're not going to nail it
on your first mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I mean, that also you can
point to the value of for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger producers of sap testing and tissue
testing that allows them to still analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: the the fertility needs of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, that tends to be well,
both indoors and outdoor field grown
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just there are there are still
tools that you can move forward from even
[SPEAKER_00]: that point and and really dial in your
plants requirements if that's the path
[SPEAKER_00]: that you really want to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you mentioned the the sap testing
and the or the sorry, the tissue testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that, part of part of
dialing that in allows us to add
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, you know, mid cycle and make
improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is also our best guess for a
variety of cultivars that all fall under
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the classification of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, different strains or
cultivars are going to pull up nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that needs to be
factored in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some call them heavy feeders
versus light feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say some plants are more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, we have a pretty big
genetic variety that falls under the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so no mix is going to be perfect for
all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you can sort of start
with a really good premium soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of tweak it based on on the mix of
years growing and then also realizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to play a whole different
levels of nutrients out of each soil mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time to, you know,
in between cycles to reamend, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a you want to have a pretty good idea
of what the proper approach to rebalancing
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil again is going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's something else,
you know, you and I have worked on a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient pack as well for Canada,
too, so that people can not only mix their
[SPEAKER_01]: own soil if they're not able to have it
shipped due to shipping cost for the peat
[SPEAKER_01]: and the perlite and all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also when they go to reamend the soil,
this is sort of our best guess based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the average plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get a soil test, you could
custom or dial in that even further in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the reamendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the expense of shipping soils
across Canada just, you know, is hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: justify in some scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reamendment pack was a good
solution to get the core materials out
[SPEAKER_00]: there when people let people use the
compost and the peat and the perlite or
[SPEAKER_00]: the aeration ingredient that they can find
in their own backyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that creates a, you know,
a pretty serious starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then doing further soil analysis and
trying to modify that mix according to
[SPEAKER_00]: what that analysis tells you out of a good
lab where you're getting where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the proper results is very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you have to stay with the same
lab because you can't really compare these
[SPEAKER_01]: test results across different labs and
make good decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use Logan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of most of the industry has gone to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got lucky in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when I see a Logan test
now, I could look at it really quickly and
[SPEAKER_01]: at a glance, see what the limiting factor
of growth is most likely in that soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an advantage of using the same
lab over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, you know, between you and I,
we kind of also had you look at ANL labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to use ANL labs here in Ontario,
which they have a Western office as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took a little bit of review on your
part to compare that to your Logan to a
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan lab analysis, just to calibrate the
two so that you could feel confident about
[SPEAKER_00]: confident about what ANL labs result for
telling you as we both know every lab
[SPEAKER_00]: result is every lab that you're using is
going to provide slightly different test
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Logan has become sort of the standard
go-to in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until just the beginning of this year,
we had no problem sending soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: down to Logan labs in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had on their website a PDF that
allowed you to print off the documents and
[SPEAKER_00]: accompany your shipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went across no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was talking to them there a week and
a half ago, and apparently the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agriculture has come up with completely
different requirements for moving products
[SPEAKER_00]: across the border now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not anywhere near as easy as it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, ultimately, it doesn't
there's nothing, I guess, special in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that there are a lot of labs running
the same test, but you need to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: test they're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of Logan, we're looking at a
malic 3 and a saturated paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just need to make sure that
it's you're looking what you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the complexity of the
particular methodology or soil test that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you stay with the same one over
and over again so you can correlate
[SPEAKER_01]: results across different samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the key point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know you and I are talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were able to find a way to essentially
prill material in terms of a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: pack, which I was pretty excited to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm open to saying on air what
we're working on right now in those
[SPEAKER_01]: regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the prilling is just it's just a
convenience factor for the end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus it also greatly cuts down the dust
that can come from just blending up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different materials and throwing
it into a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prilling is just adding a lignin as a
binder that turns it into a into a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes handling the product very,
very safe and sensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made a big difference in terms of
our amendment product as we got our first
[SPEAKER_00]: prilled batch back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm wishing I could do that down
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a good source that's one to
work with me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still doing a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mixing by hand and it's not prilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you and I are working right now on a
grow and bloom formula that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: prilled in a fertilizer that would be able
to be available both in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada, the same product, because I
know your experience with logistics would
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to get stuff down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited for that for people
who don't want to necessarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go with the soil or want to be
able to add fertility throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm looking at targeting
certain ratios with certain amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the sustainability of those
amendments and the MPK levels as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to go through the
same similar process we went with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take a little while, but I know
we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm looking forward to that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's something that we get asked
for all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that comes out of some of
the the background of growers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from a hydroponic past,
and they're used to adding various
[SPEAKER_00]: different nutrients at different stages of
growth and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's it's a product that the
market certainly is used to using and and
[SPEAKER_00]: and is asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be nice if we can develop our
own that meets those needs in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that the soil mix does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so one other thing I want to ask you
is what, you know, as someone who who
[SPEAKER_01]: interacts with a ton of growers on a daily
basis, what are the typical, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of like questions that you get asked
or problems that you find growers come
[SPEAKER_01]: across the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a really, really big
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we spend a tremendous amount of time
answering questions and educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I get that that just points to the
comments I made in the earlier part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about kind of still it's an
emerging market as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's such a hunger out there
on the part of growers for more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start going down this rabbit
hole, I don't need to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets pretty fascinating pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and people come in here all the time
with or emailing us all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With questions, they're pretty,
pretty broad ranging and pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be hard pressed to really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a question or two that that stood
out, I I just you know, I'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: comment that the challenge, probably the
main challenge that we face is that that
[SPEAKER_00]: that person who has had a hydroponic
background who started off using bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in some fashion, maybe a pro mix
medium that they were growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they they discover the living soil
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they hear about it from from a fellow
grower or a friend where they read about
[SPEAKER_00]: it and they get all excited about it and
get this real passion for wanting to try
[SPEAKER_00]: this out and come in and get what they
need to for the first grow and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're they're they're leaping in
with one foot into into the living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the pool, but they just can't seem
to pull their hydroponic foot out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they hang on to understandings and
belief systems that that were relevant for
[SPEAKER_00]: you for using a cocoa or a pro mix with
with bottle nutrients and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't those those assumptions
don't necessarily carry over to a living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, such as just sort of pointing out to
them why they don't need to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things anymore and and why they
they do need to, you know, consider other
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences between a soil approach
that probably is the I'd have to say is
[SPEAKER_00]: the singular most challenging issue that
we face on a day to day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was thinking about it once I asked
myself, and I think that the two biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: things I come across are the challenge of
watering correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the watering relates so much
to the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it with multiple guests,
specifically the one with Don Marshall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to that podcast,
I think that one is just a gem when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to talking about watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd suggest that for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other question that the other or
the other challenge I find is that people
[SPEAKER_01]: do too much right off the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, they may switch to a living
soil and then they start doing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: can F inputs and you know, because a buddy
told them those were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they start doing, you know,
add this product from here and that
[SPEAKER_01]: product from there and all these different
secret sauces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, you have this
like conglomeration of inputs to where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to know what was good and what
was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I and I don't want to discourage people
from experimentation, but I'd say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, start slow, you know,
maybe just start with water or do a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: beds with just water so you can get a
baseline for how the soil performs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if you want to do,
you know, some inputs or some teas or
[SPEAKER_01]: things, do them on on half your plants or
a portion of your of your facility that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're dedicating to R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start doing everything all at
once, it just gets it gets really chaotic
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes it really hard to know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along those lines, if you were to
say, have a crop loss or fail for heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals, then you have the challenge of
like that many more inputs and issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to narrow it down to what
contributed to that is almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more with you on that
point, Ted, because just trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, again, pointing at that
enthusiasm and the passion that customers
[SPEAKER_00]: come in here with and just trying to hold
their feet on the ground sometimes is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a challenge because you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to try everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've read about 16 different items and
they got, you know, they got their budget
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to buy 12 of them and
throw them at the garden sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, well, hang on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how are you going to know which
ones are really giving you the results or
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are giving you the problems
when you're throwing multiple options at
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's very sound advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with water only your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add something, maybe a little fish
hydrolysis or whatever it is that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to try, but try that on your second grow
and realize that the only way you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to become an experienced gardener,
the only way you're really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a set of gardening skills is by
making mistakes, but also by really
[SPEAKER_00]: observing the impacts of these decisions
that you're making on your soils and for
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and knowing that it was this
particular product that had this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was using this particular set of
genetics, there's so many variables and
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing too much at your grow at any
particular time is generally not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have too much of a positive benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say keep that money in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it towards a par meter, a dino light,
some of these tools that may be really
[SPEAKER_01]: useful, a blue mat moisture meter or some
other way of measuring your moisture in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that you're going to use grow after
grow that are going to make you a better
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, but you do get the sort of mad
scientist mentality where more is better
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to start fiddling and you
read about on this forum of people using
[SPEAKER_01]: this input and fermenting that product and
it gets a little, it gets a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: control, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and just have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people are often driven
by growing these the biggest, dankest
[SPEAKER_00]: plant they possibly can and that's great,
that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at the pumpkin guys who
are constantly competing against each
[SPEAKER_00]: other for the biggest bestest,
but just have fun at it and take the time
[SPEAKER_00]: to really observe what's going on in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's good advice for
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spending a little extra time in the garden
is huge and it's going to make the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: difference overall in your plant's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did mention genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is something that gets
overlooked too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics are going to play one of the
biggest roles overall in getting you that
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest, highest THC or highest
cannabinoid plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something to highlight as
well for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed our conversation today,
Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you wanted to add before
we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'd like to add is that I
have tremendous appreciation for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the help and support that you've provided
over the short period of time that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: known each other and I'm looking forward
to the next stage because if there's one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about gardening, you're never there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never reach the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to move as far ahead as you make
the effort to approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really exciting time to be looking
down that rabbit hole of soil science with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental challenges that we have
in our world today and for food production
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet still trying to mitigate the
impact of our environmental degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really encouraging
science that is pointing to the values of
[SPEAKER_00]: our soils and our plant interactions with
them and it's a way of exploring that if
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing more than within a 16 square foot
patch of your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be quite a rewarding approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I love what you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love having the ability to recommend the
soil mix now for people that are in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking to try living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that I've gotten to work with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and your son on throughout this
process and I look forward to formulating
[SPEAKER_01]: new products here in 2021.
