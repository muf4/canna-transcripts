[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw the top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Dr. Kevin Maier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Maier has spent the last five years
driving the development of large-scale
[SPEAKER_02]: micropropagation programs for cannabis in
North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin received his PhD in Genome Science
and Technology from the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: British Columbia and translates this
experience with genetics and plant science
[SPEAKER_02]: to every facet of operations, product
innovation, and establishing new sales
[SPEAKER_02]: channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin has established key partnerships
with some of the largest licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: producers in Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and continues to ensure company execution
while driving the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Kevin, thanks for coming on the
podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's start off by telling listeners
a little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, my background is academic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a PhD in Genome Science and
Technology, which with the focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial genetics way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, at the time I wasn't
focused on plants, but I was fortunate
[SPEAKER_00]: enough when the early Canadian cannabis
companies and licensing was coming online
[SPEAKER_00]: to join an upstart there and really just
grew to love plants more than I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I would and dive into this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I couldn't be more happy
that I'm here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working in the cannabis space
for the last five years and typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just focusing on the nursery
space and tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out about you guys from Suzanne,
who's a good friend of mine, and she
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended that we have a chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, this isn't a topic that I happen
to know all that much about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of wanted to let you just lead
the discussion here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
what, you know, tissue culture is and how
[SPEAKER_02]: it works and sort of what you've what you
found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll take I'll take even a bigger
step back and just, you know, touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go a little bit historical
here for a second, you know, just so that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows where this comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a there was this guy
named Gottlieb Haberland way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 1900s, who we assume was a pretty
cool guy because he was working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really the father of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, was studying what
plants, you know, what nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly micronutrients from soil,
you know, the plants really need to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really just got picked up heavily
in the 1960s when, you know, the concept
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing plants in kind of a clean
environment with very specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and minerals and sugars could be utilized,
you know, to produce plants and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them alive, not only just to keep
them from dying out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if something was really challenged or
almost going extinct, but actually grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lots and lots of plants very handily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in the 1960s, this really took off
for orchids in ornamental flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really just through the 60s and 90s,
it kind of exploded as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to produce clean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, plant tissue culture is this
very large field that encompasses really
[SPEAKER_00]: any study of plants growing in a
specialized media or nutrient-rich media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that larger academic world,
there's a subsection that really just
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on clean plant production,
or you might say clean cloning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's called micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear us sort of throw around the
term tissue culture and micropropagation a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, but micropropagation is really the
commercial nursery size, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for large-scale plant production within
the larger academic world of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, I mean, any strawberry,
blueberry you've had in the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: has actually been produced, or for the
most part, it's been produced through
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's critical in a lot of
different industries, like potatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: berries, bananas, I mean, ornamental
flowers, and even now complex medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies like Dole and Driscoll,
you know, they really have taken this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and run with it, particularly
in crops where we're monocropping and
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses start to creep up and cause a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I'd say, sort of the larger
history of tissue culture and where it
[SPEAKER_00]: came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is really focus on
micropropagation within cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp-type cannabis and THC cannabis,
we've got a couple different entities sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of focusing on different areas of those
two markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal really is to produce clean
plants, virus-free plants, or at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as pathogen-free or virus-free
as we can get them, particularly with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more well-known viruses that we're
starting to identify here, so that growers
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very clean and healthy plant,
happy plants, going into production and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, also can scale that production
as they go from maybe their startup phase
[SPEAKER_00]: to a larger, you know, build out an
expansion, you know, hopefully because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the case of cannabis, I've noticed
that a lot of people over the last decade
[SPEAKER_02]: have been talking a lot about tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've visited labs that were going to be
set up, but then I kind of died off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really hear a lot of people that
were successfully doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like there's some challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it exists, but it seems like it was
a lot harder than people thought it was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the challenges associated
with tissue culture that may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, say more unique to a crop like
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's definitely a challenging
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, you know, unlike some other crops that
are, you know, that have been selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: bred for being robust and really,
you know, hardy and different conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease resistant, you know,
cannabis is really only just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that kind of breeding treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to take the crop as it
exists now and mass produce it in tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is very challenging because every,
you know, every cultivar is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are, you know, chock full of
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a challenge just knowing
what's in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, we deal with removing
really any bacterial, fungal or viral
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you don't even know what some of
those are, it just makes for a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think some of the, you know,
I touched on it before where you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: very larger kind of academic side of
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people that have
really, you know, been studying plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture and tried to apply that
knowledge to cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a degree of success, maybe just
producing some clean plants or clean
[SPEAKER_00]: mother stock, but in a very lengthy time
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now we have some of the
large nursery teams that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing large scale micro propagation,
tens of millions of plants per year,
[SPEAKER_00]: shifting into the cannabis space and
bringing that sort of large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial knowledge into it and marrying
that with sort of the academic expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the big
differences for why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people got really excited about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive and time consuming to
set up and develop a TC lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most companies, if something
hasn't really worked out over about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 months, that's usually the point
where they kind of go, okay, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if this is really worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're kind of coming
from the commercial production side and
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand that, you know,
it could be a couple of years of R&D just
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop, you know, the precise,
you know, nutrient formula that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow these, you know, each particular
cultivar happily in culture and multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, I think, is what's driving
the development, at least for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a few of the larger operators in
this space now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went quiet for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, you know, not a lot of
execution because I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: really experienced commercial teams,
they weren't really dipping their toes in
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you touched on some of the benefits of
tissue culture already in the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can remove, you know, bacterial,
viral, fungal diseases, things that may
[SPEAKER_02]: be, you know, systemic in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some dealing with something that's
like powdery mildew, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: might be something that you could,
you can get a clean plant back to a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in addition, it's also a faster way of
getting more plants than cloning as well
[SPEAKER_02]: once you have the system set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I could go into the
whole, you know, there's a whole benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: side of tissue culture when it comes to
plant performance and disease resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: or just, you know, general health and
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plants in, I guess, plants that
have come from tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sugar cane and other crops that,
you know, are really commonly produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost across the board, you see sort of
an inherent health and resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like, you might just see an
inherent slightly improved resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew just because the plant is
starting healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting without essentially being
coated in, you know, fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just going to carry that
health through the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look at just really every
single way that we can produce clean
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, I mean, space wise, you know,
the efficiency of tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at it compared to
conventional cloning, takes up maybe 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's a pretty
rough estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in a maybe few thousand
square feet of a lab in tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we can produce over a million
plants a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were looking at a cloning room,
a mother space, sort of a single tier
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning space, you know, you're definitely
not going to achieve those kinds of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers in that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take me, take me through this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one question I had then is you're not
necessarily, you're not doing anything to
[SPEAKER_02]: modify the genetic makeup of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just reproducing it when we talk
about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not, so, you know, within the
larger world of plant tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely an academic side to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they might focus on,
on, you know, genetically modifying
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms, but that's, that's not really
what micro propagation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're just, we're just basically
clean cloning in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit more like a computer
chip manufacturing facility where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got no dust particles in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're working in a very sterile
environment and just taking advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's ability to multiply,
even when it's very small and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and produce lots and lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no, we're not, we're not impacting the
genetics of the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an organic grower myself,
how should I feel about tissue culture in
[SPEAKER_02]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you would, you would
instinctively think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic production would, would despise or
should not, you know, feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really interesting is that,
you know, there's already a lot of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture that's used within organic
production, which people might not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, the strawberry industry in
California, the organic strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: production, you know, is heavily reliant
on plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a, I should say,
you know, basically there's, there's a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that organic producers can, you know,
source plant material from tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't impact, you know,
as long as they're still running it
[SPEAKER_00]: through an entirely organic process,
it doesn't, doesn't impact their
[SPEAKER_00]: certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think where the challenge for some
organic producers, you know, in using
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture lies is in how,
or what type of hormones you're using to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're producing plants in tissue
culture, they're really going through a
[SPEAKER_00]: few different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first stage we call initiation is
when you're bringing in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sort of sterilizing it,
you know, cleaning it up, sanitizing it
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get rid of any surface pathogens
and get it then into a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a test tube or a glass jar to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tissue culture, once you've sort of
verified that it's clean, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those problems anymore,
which can take a while, many months,
[SPEAKER_00]: you move the plants into the next stage,
which is multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really just sort of guiding the
plant to be more bushy, sort of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mini mother plant really, so that you can,
you know, every few weeks it can,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be split into multiple plants and
you can build a big stock that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next stage is really bringing it out
of tissue culture and to really tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to start rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you're going into a plug setup
or you're using a media that tells the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to root, using a rooting hormone,
and then you're basically just hardening
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant outside of the tissue culture
for the last and fourth stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we just call acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be, you know, hardening it
off in the greenhouse, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now organic production, if you're using
synthetic hormones, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your tissue culture media, that might
not jive well with an organic production
[SPEAKER_00]: regime because they're not naturally
derived, but there's actually a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture that can be done even just
with naturally derived plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you know, you can even
utilize something like a willow bark
[SPEAKER_00]: extract in a tissue culture rooting
procedure that is just naturally derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing synthetic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, organic producers
don't need to be afraid of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really this sterile chemical lab
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really can be done really
just in a very clean and organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, compatible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it does and it doesn't, because one
of the things I struggle with is the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that it does seem to be quite challenging
for a lot of people to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to set up a lab and actually get
successful plants out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm wondering here is,
I mean, assuming that the media culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: the culture medium, and then the nutrients
that you're feeding to the plant whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: that concoction is, that would be,
you know, chemically based or synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that point, when you give the
plant back to the grower, they could treat
[SPEAKER_02]: it organically and that doesn't affect the
organic certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, is there anyone doing this on
scale that's actually using a fully
[SPEAKER_02]: organic process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you really believe that's even
possible on scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand I could go and
harvest willow bark and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: access some of the hormones out of there
and potentially clone a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'm not I'm not truly getting a
clean plant, am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can I can I still go through the
whole process and get a clean plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely are groups that are
using very, you know, organic regimes
[SPEAKER_00]: where everything from everything that
they're utilizing in the plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: media, you know, is is sort of organically
derived materials that are just really
[SPEAKER_00]: just going into media that's producing the
plant in a clean lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other external, you know,
problems, you know, pathogens and pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get a hold on that plant early
while it's in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of the other things that
I think really gets me interested where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think organic production can
get really exciting here using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, starting from tissue culture is,
you know, just because you're removing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the the natural microorganisms in
the plant to get it healthy at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an opportunity there really right
after that plant is coming out of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture to really introduce every type of
beneficial organism that you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I you know, one thing that we're
really looking at is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are all the beneficials?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are all the natural, you know,
beneficial mycorrhizal and things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can inoculate the plant with early as it's
coming out of the really coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or out of the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, you know, it's it's we're
just taking advantage of nature there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just setting the plant up to,
you know, really thrive instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: being completely barren of all,
I guess, microbial life and going out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, into the field or the the
pod or the the indoor setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since you're starting so clean,
you can really do whatever you want at
[SPEAKER_02]: that point in terms of what you want to
introduce to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the things we've seen is,
you know, there's a lot of I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a misconception when when
somebody is growing a strain that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they've been cloning it for
years and years and years and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people will attribute
it to something like genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, often that's not the case
when a plant is being cloned serially over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it also builds up a lot of
microorganisms within it that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is these are microorganisms,
you know, bacterial or fungal that their
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the plant sort of varies
from symbiotic to bordering on pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the more those build up,
the more they can impact the plant's vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what we're seeing is that
the plant is declining in terms of either
[SPEAKER_00]: just vigor and yield or potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, very often it's just that
it's been cloned for so long, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated so many passengers within it,
some of them not very good for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, we really need to get rid
of them before the plant can come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: its sort of we call it, you know,
generation zero seed generation vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, tissue culture allows you
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, with an emphasis
on, you know, beneficial organisms right
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, you can you can really not
only reset the plant, but then set it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as advantageously colonized with,
you know, stuff that's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help it really going to help it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the things I wanted to
cover, because you hear people talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genetic drift or genetic
exhaustion or this idea that that clones
[SPEAKER_02]: will degrade over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think is probably more like you
said, the case where it's this this
[SPEAKER_02]: buildup of, you know, endophytes or,
you know, having a plant that's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot of environmental stress and
that people are cloning it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: off of a stress to stress mother plant,
they could be getting less vigorous
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily a reflection of the
genetic material of the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's always there's
obviously the classic diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant could be, you know,
getting Fusarium and Phytophthora,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, could be impacting the nursery
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these other, you know,
root borne and, you know, fungal pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be there impacting the plant that
are really hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Fusarium, obviously in sort of
the California clone nursery is really
[SPEAKER_00]: just devastated a lot of more the
traditional clone nurseries and tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you know, allows you to get away
from those, which, you know, often are the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of it that is a little less
understood and we're just kind of really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into it now is the virus side of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of known viruses right
now that impact cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, we have a pretty good,
I guess, idea of what some of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test for we test for viruses
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of my colleagues,
Jack, Dr. Jack Bunns, hopefully will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to jump on the podcast and talk a
little bit more about plant viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we we test for plant
viruses because we need to be able to show
[SPEAKER_00]: that the stock we're producing is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of it, we also just need
to help people identify what the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're looking at it and
attributing it to maybe genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it very well could just be a virus
that, you know, isn't showing up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical virus screen or just something
that they're not testing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it kind of tends to fall into
three camps, one being that you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: a buildup of bacterial and fungal
endophytes that are maybe impacting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, removing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you really see a boost in vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other camp being viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's certainly a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing it a lot on the West Coast,
a lot of obsolete and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third camp being actual,
you know, environmental issues or genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if I were to do tissue
culture with 100 different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, you know, it might only be one
or two that are truly aging out and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a having sort of either having a mutation,
true mutation that's causing a problem or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that typically they'll, you know,
fall in the in the pathogen camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I was trying to consider genetics to
use in tissue culture, what sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects do you look for in a plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would assume if a plant is
susceptible to a particular pathogen like
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew or, you know, fusarium,
something like that, it may not be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: candidate for tissue culture just in the
sense that, yes, you can remove it and get
[SPEAKER_02]: them back a clean plant, but it's probably
going to be susceptible down the road and
[SPEAKER_02]: have the same issues later in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's a tough question
to answer because I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone everyone might select differently
for their own reasons, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial or just disease resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you all it's easy to say you
should always select for a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistant, but disease resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we understand the
complexity of the commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market on the retail side and what people
are sort of trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a there's a demand,
I guess, every year for the new new and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's going to really,
I guess, clash with traditional breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, where we're trying to to have very
healthy, clean plants that we're selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: over multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a it's a difficult one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think tissue culture,
at least, is a tool, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think provides some of these
growers who are dealing with more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenged or pathogen susceptible plants
with a way to reset their population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, even if you weren't
producing every plant through tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you might be able to reset your
mother stock every four to six months from
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture so that there wasn't enough
time for something that you knew would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably impact the plant that plant to
take hold and cause you real problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's got me thinking from my
conversation with Jeremy Plum over a proof
[SPEAKER_02]: about this idea of getting consistent
chemovar expression for like a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you are dealing with a
particular disease or something and you go
[SPEAKER_02]: into a dispensary and get this particular
strain or cultivar and you have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: response to it, you could very well get a
very different chemovar expression going
[SPEAKER_02]: back, you know, even buying it from the
same grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things he's been
working on and I think tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: could be an important part of that process
and keeping your genetics consistent over
[SPEAKER_02]: time, too, for a medical patient like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember, Jeremy, I actually
listened to that that discussion you had
[SPEAKER_00]: with Jeremy and, you know, he was talking
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember, he was actually mentioning
how they had the same cultivar grown at
[SPEAKER_00]: three different environments and it was a
starkly different chemical profile in all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how challenging it is even having,
you know, the same genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they're impacted by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, where tissue
culture can play a role here obviously is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends how much the
environment is impacting variable
[SPEAKER_00]: production or variable chemotypes,
you know, of a cultivar even in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing a lot of variation and
it's caused by environmental things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, tissue culture might not impact that
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's, you know, different
environments in terms of pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this room is a little more pathogen
challenge for powdery mildew or this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, potentially is developing some
viral issues, you know, having the
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent stock every time is certainly
going to give you a lot more consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so you can get that elusive,
you know, consistency for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, which everyone is striving for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people are, you know,
passionately striving for, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this would just be another
tool to ensure that consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you look at some of the
clinical trials that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really have occurred in lots of different
medicinal plants, most of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the project won't even be
greenlit unless the plants are coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture just because of the typical
consistency with that methodology is just
[SPEAKER_00]: so much stronger than normal cloning or
from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess take me through this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I was a grower and decided that,
you know, I had a really special plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wanted to sort of preserve or reset
or cultivate in large numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know this is something I'm going to
want down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume I would contact a company like
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to give you a certain amount
of plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how does this all work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends a little bit on what the aim
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just wanting to store
something or bank it, so get it into
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture for storage, or you're just
wanting to get it into tissue culture to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up and get a few clean plants
back, you know, that whole process is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to take about anywhere from
five to eight months, assuming that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not any major viral challenges
with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we would talk to a company
like ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we would basically coordinate
either visiting and sampling material
[SPEAKER_00]: directly, having our team do it,
or providing a, you know, detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: guideline on how to basically provide us
with just large branches or cuttings that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can sample from that could be shipped
to us in a sort of a good way,
[SPEAKER_00]: either same day or next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would basically harvest as many,
you know, viable samples off that tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: as we could, so that we would have,
you know, at least a couple hundred sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of surviving, we call X plants,
you know, so samples in tissue culture now
[SPEAKER_00]: growing without contamination that have
survived kind of the initial cleanup
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that all happens pretty
quickly, you know, from the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody says, let's go, we can show up
the next day or within a week and get that
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't really know how successful
that plant is initially in tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few weeks, but, you know,
after that, we're really just taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: through a series of steps, you know,
within kind of the regime of how we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant in culture, so that it's really
just getting used to growing in culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you're sort of taking
plant material, you're telling it to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in something without roots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to just morphologically adapt to
that environment, just like any plant
[SPEAKER_00]: would in a different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes some time for the plant to get
used to growing in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, then you're driving
the plant to start multiplying so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can build some stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really at that point,
once it's happy there, we could pull clean
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out at, you know, anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just wanted a couple clean
plants back, we might be able to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: in three, four months, if it's just a few
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually people want to, you know,
get a couple hundred or at least a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least 50 or a tray back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can run some type of trial,
either put that right into mother stock or
[SPEAKER_00]: get a few in production and do a
side-by-side comparison, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with those plants versus the plants from
traditional cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just work with, you know,
with everybody to find a plan that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're wanting to just store the
plants at that point, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would just maintain maybe a very small
quantity in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're wanting to go and do
production, so, you know, they have a room
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want to dedicate or get
supplemental clones from us for,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it really just becomes kind of a math
and calculations around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have a thousand plants but they want
3,000 a month and the plants are doubling
[SPEAKER_00]: every month, you know, it's going to take
us a couple extra months just to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock up and then be able to provide them
that, you know, 3,000 every month sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just, there's a lot of weird
calculations that go into it in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out the timelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I think you should
expect to be able to get back some clean
[SPEAKER_00]: material if you're putting something into
culture, you know, within six to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months, if it has viral challenges,
particularly like obsolete and viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: we usually tell people to anticipate about
eight to 11 months because there will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely be additional steps and what we
call sort of deep meristematic culturing
[SPEAKER_00]: where we might have to culture just from
meristematic tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who's not aware,
you know, apical meristematic tissue is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the most newly forming piece of
tissue on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't really been vascularized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't connected to the circulatory
system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't really been infected by,
you know, other viruses or pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in that plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can sample from that,
you can essentially get away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: viral problem just because that tissue
hasn't been infected yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you hear about people
talking about tissue culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: often you'll hear things, you know,
you'll often hear meristematic tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly a method to sort of get
clean tissue from a mother plant that has
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem and get away from viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the only way to get away from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the only way to get away from
those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually take a parallel approach
and maybe have about three methods running
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time so that we're covered
because meristematic tissue culture takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take 10 to 12 or more months to
develop samples from meristematic culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think there's roughly a
timeline there that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people might, their eyes might bug
out of it and go, wow, that's a sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: shock for sure that, you know,
that it's going to take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if something is
commercially important for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're producing it consistently
in a recurring basis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably an easy case to be made
for getting it cleaned up and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: backup of it and being able to scale up
production, clean production if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this got me thinking about one of the
challenges associated with giving genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: to a company like yourself or really any
company that has the ability to reproduce
[SPEAKER_02]: those genetics or do research on those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a special plant that I have,
you know, ownership over in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've either bred it or, you know,
I want to use it in commercial production
[SPEAKER_02]: in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want more competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want other people using this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of rights and privacy do I have
around, you know, working with a company
[SPEAKER_02]: like yourselves or yourself regarding
protection, you know, essentially IP of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever plant tissue I give you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, Ted, I'm glad you brought that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question that I get every day,
you know, how are our genetics protected
[SPEAKER_00]: and what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, we make it very clear
and we have contracts that support this
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, your genetics are your
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no claim or ownership on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do any genomic sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do any cloning without your
approval on all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think it's critical,
especially within the nursery space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where you are dealing with
customers' genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have bred those themselves or,
you know, done an extensive amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we understand the value
there is huge, especially on the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, if you have something and
you don't want it to be flooding the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we take that very seriously,
kind of intellectual property and
[SPEAKER_00]: protection of our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we make no claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the other side of it for us is,
you know, we just, we don't do any
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you look at a lot of nurseries,
whether they're doing tissue culture or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, I think, you know, it's very hard to
say that you'll protect a customer's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics if you have a breeding program
over here where you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to develop and acquire and
get interesting cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think that's a really big
piece of it for us is to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we, you know, not only can show that we
have, you know, no interest and no
[SPEAKER_00]: business, you know, developing genetics
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to help people scale and
produce their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big piece, you know,
you might want to look at the nurseries
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if that, if they're developing a
breeding program, you know, that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a red flag that there,
you know, there's probably an incentive
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere for somebody to, you know,
even if it's not something that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do or the CEO will drive, you know,
there's going to be somebody in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere who's going to be interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think not having a breeding program
just takes a lot of that incentive away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the contractual protection,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, I think you hit on two
things that are, from a grower
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, really concerning.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, you know, the idea that they're
going to, someone's going to do something
[SPEAKER_02]: with that actual tissue or those specific
genetics, but also this idea of genome
[SPEAKER_02]: sequencing to where you can identify in a
genome these specific occurrences across
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple genetics, you know, you're going
to see thousands, thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can say, hey, this is what seems
to be special across all these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then take that data and start a
separate breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you guys are not doing any
genetic sequencing without permission from
[SPEAKER_02]: a grower themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the issues, you know,
here in the Northwest that happened a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years ago that you may,
maybe you're familiar with too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, we were very aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a bit of a wake-up call
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, one thing I didn't
mention, we do have the ability to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic fingerprint of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's critical for a nursery
for quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I go and produce 10,000
plants, I probably should be checking that
[SPEAKER_00]: batch as it's going out to just verify
that it was the right plant before it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: out and gets grown by somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really typical in the blueberry
industry and other crops that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: in large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big difference between doing a
genotype, a very simple genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing genomic sequencing is exactly
what you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to kind of do a deeper dive
for underlying information potentially on
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes that plant interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way we genotype is
completely anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's called a sort of variable
nucleotide tandem repeat sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the same way that humans do
forensic genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're, you know, looking for
somebody who matches a sample of hair or
[SPEAKER_00]: blood, you know, you can use a very kind
of basic genotyping method to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: that the identity matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very much like a fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell you if that person has
blue eyes or brown hair or is really great
[SPEAKER_00]: at producing THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just tells you that this plant equals
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the same and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, that type of
methodology and maybe understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying technology and when groups are
talking about genomic sequencing or
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyping is really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the event that you talk
about in the Pacific Northwest that got
[SPEAKER_00]: really people frustrated, you know,
does tie a little bit to the method they
[SPEAKER_00]: were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's some companies that
do a genetic fingerprint using what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a SNP profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a panel of, you know,
30,000 individual regions within a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genome that create a fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of those single, you know,
nucleotide regions can be tied to a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually matters and impacts the
plant or is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so they can sort of
potentially derive some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say potentially, because I don't want to
infer that they're trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly the possibility is there to
get functional information from a SNP
[SPEAKER_00]: panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whereas a VNTR type fingerprint
doesn't give you any information,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really about, you know,
any functional genes within that genome
[SPEAKER_00]: that can really provide any useful
information for things like breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: developing a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realize I went on a bit of a tangent
there, but I think it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting for people to understand the
differences, you know, in genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprinting and genome sequencing and,
you know, what the downsides or risks are
[SPEAKER_00]: with some methods over the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be the first to admit that I'm
fairly ignorant on a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think one of the challenges that
happened with that particular company
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't necessarily that they were bad
people or had bad intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just poorly communicated and then
people didn't fully understand exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what the implications were that were
associated with a lot of what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to do, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I see both sides of that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, having I think whatever
company someone decides to work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think having a very frank discussion and
understanding what rights you have as a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having that contractually written
up so that both sides understand what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're you know, what services that are
going to be provided and and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having a really clear, not overly
complicated, you know, agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we often just call them material
transfer agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, ours just is meant to be
very readable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's all just built to protect
the IP of of the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want to just plant our flag
and say, it's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to help, you know,
our our specialty and a lot of micro
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation tissue culture nurseries,
you know, their specialty is large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting really, really large number
numbers of plants produced in a clean way,
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently, economically, maybe even
cheaper than traditional cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we think that's going to
drive the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, stratification across,
you know, any developing crop where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, right now, nursery is internal
for most companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as markets develop,
just like in Washington and California and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of a lot of states that have been
going for a while now, you start to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery side start to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's going to just continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to you've already
seen, obviously, processing extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: separate kind of from traditional
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nursery side, I think,
is pretty ripe for that that
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation where, you know,
we can the economy of scale for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a lot of clean clones for a lot of
different groups is just a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: economical than than a group doing it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that's really the way it's
going to go, because it's gone that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every other crop that's
produced produce clonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about your
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the economic side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: What states are you guys in currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the costs associated with
this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in Washington for just just
under a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we have a hemp nursery, a hemp tissue
culture nursery, as well as a THC cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been going since the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, since the summer,
it's been we've been kind of bombarded
[SPEAKER_00]: with demand and interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite surprising, pleasantly
surprising just to see how many groups
[SPEAKER_00]: were interested in this and that we might
be able to help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different things on
the services side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just putting a cultivar into tissue
culture, getting it cleaned up and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, that might range because it's
sort of time dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a monthly cost, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in the range of three thousand
to maybe forty five hundred dollars per
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, roughly, to get it into tissue
culture, cleaned up and handed back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to continue storing
it or scale up for production,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably just a continuing
subscription fee, a couple hundred bucks a
[SPEAKER_00]: month or a few hundred bucks a month for
us to maintain that, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In scaled production, we really just at
that point shift to a traditional nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you say, I want this many
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a purchase order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting a deposit down and getting
a, you know, getting a clean clone order
[SPEAKER_00]: so many months down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a bit more typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody asks me what what
what's the clone pricing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really does vary by market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, more developed markets,
whether they're external genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if we if we as a nursery
have genetics from a breeder, because
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders do license genetics to us as a
nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we support the breeders to if they're
trying to get something that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: developed, to the market at scale,
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers can acquire those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might cost more than than mass
producing their own genetics because they
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's no royalty associated
with their own and whether it's sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: one off clone purchase versus a recurring
clone purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm dancing around the price question a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just to give you a range,
it might be, you know, a one off might be
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere from like eight to twenty dollars
a clone, depending on if it's their own
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or, you know, a very very
exciting, new, interesting cultivar from a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder that has a massive royalty tied to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really just providing plants
one time so that the grower can mother off
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's recurring clone production
definitely tends to get down, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more in like the 48 dollars per plant
range, potentially even getting sub four
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, you know, if it's very,
very large scale commercial micro
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation on a recurring basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to I was going to try and pin
you down for at least some sort of number
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I appreciate everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize there's a lot of variables that
go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys are only in Washington,
but it sounds like you had plans to
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially be in other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in Canada at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're active and we'll also be active in
about six weeks in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have that lab just
finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set up here over the next few weeks
and we will actively be able to take in
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and work with people probably
about six weeks from today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be, you know, roughly the
last week or the first last week of July
[SPEAKER_00]: or the first week of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to start working with
growers in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we were also really just
looking to expand into a few other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can't be everywhere,
but we certainly have a model where we
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate with existing companies in
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already licensed and functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can come in, develop a
nursery division under their license and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of share in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also get access to a lot of those
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're a company that is
in a different state that's coming online,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly, you know, maybe on the East
Coast, for example, you know, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: chat, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, we'd love to have that
conversation about how we might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here in Washington state, you have a
medical market that you have laws that
[SPEAKER_02]: allow for a grower to grow up to 15 plants
at home if they have a prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a license card from the state
directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that something you guys support?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, paying $8 to $20 for a
clone as a home grower for six plants or
[SPEAKER_02]: even 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to yield a lot more than I would
have going, you know, going down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: rec store and buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus it allows me a little more control
over the growing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys support that sort of thing on
a smaller scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, I'm glad you brought it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in discussion about how we can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to support home medical
patients and people who are growing at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the challenge for us is we just
don't have the bandwidth to deal with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of microtransactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're really trying to do is
partner with retailers who can sort of set
[SPEAKER_00]: up all of the transactions with the home
growers and then facilitate a larger order
[SPEAKER_00]: from us just so that we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people can, you know,
we can just coordinate local pickup for
[SPEAKER_00]: those people that need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would absolutely love to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, we're still fairly new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the groups we're working with
are large rec growers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're taking a lot of our
bandwidth, certainly as they expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we never forget about,
you know, wanting to help out medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's sort of the way we'll
be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's such a challenge for medical
patients to get clean clones because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact, you know, you have plant limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't do a ton of cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself because of the number of plants
you're allowed to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go out and get,
you want to acquire new genetics or get
[SPEAKER_02]: new plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't grow from seed, the chances
of bringing in hemp russet and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these other, you know, the canvas aphid
are really, really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love the idea of starting from,
you know, tissue culture plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even a $20 a clone, that's not,
that's kind of the market rate for clones
[SPEAKER_02]: in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not really that, that high,
surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the, you know, the prices I'm
talking about are, you know, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: like large scale wholesale kind of
production for commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I think the retail,
you know, the retailer is probably going
[SPEAKER_00]: to tack on what they tack on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the number I've heard is,
you know, whatever the, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: typical, you know, prices directly for a
cultivator usually going to end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: about three times that by the time it gets
to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think, you know, ideally we
can, we can target some cultivars that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe we already produce that we
can provide at as low a cost as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those, for those home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was sort of it for the
questions I had regarding tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you, you know,
taking their time today to answer some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's there anything else that you
wanted to add before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd want to
leave people with is to, to maybe just
[SPEAKER_00]: shift their thinking a little bit around,
you know, how a facility is laid out in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cultivation where, you know,
right now the internal nursing industry
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the business, you know,
maybe takes up anywhere from 10 to 25% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility space, certainly takes a lot
of bandwidth and personnel and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of costs and challenges around clone
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what would that look like
if, you know, you didn't have to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: any clones yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that space could be dedicated to
flowering, you know, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: additional veg space, but also just more
flowering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how would that impact your
business, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you could take the space you
have and, you know, generate 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30% more revenue generating product
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a, it's a weird shift for
people just to think about losing what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what feels like a piece of,
a piece of the whole entity, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the facility is, but, you know,
take a look at other industries and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be so scared of the idea that,
you know, maybe working with a dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: external nursery slowly, not all,
you know, not, not a hundred percent to
[SPEAKER_00]: start, but, you know, supplementing your
existing clone stock and taking over some
[SPEAKER_00]: of your clone production, even if they can
do it cheaper or on par with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and expand your production capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe that's a different way to
think about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that might be something that's
worth taking a look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a really interesting
point thinking about how, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of labor, stress, workflow,
crop risk, you know, chances of not having
[SPEAKER_02]: a clean plant, all of those things that
come in with a traditional cloning method
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're also used to using in,
in facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little bit of a, of a mental shift
to consider some of these other options.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, glad we could chat about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, thanks for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be talking with your colleague
regarding viruses too, which I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: forward to another, another topic that I
don't know a ton about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for your time and what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you the best.
