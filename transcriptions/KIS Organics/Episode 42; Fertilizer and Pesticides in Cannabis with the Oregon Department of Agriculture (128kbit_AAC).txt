[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, rules and regulations are an
important aspect of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, it's important to know that
the products we purchase to use in our
[SPEAKER_02]: garden are safe and providing the
nutrients or microbes that are listed on
[SPEAKER_02]: the labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: My interview this week is with Sunny
Summers and Matt Haynes with the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon Department of Agriculture have
been leaders at the state level in regards
[SPEAKER_02]: to product testing and information sharing
for consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very excited that they accepted my
request to come on the podcast to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about some of their findings and to help
growers better understand pesticide and
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer product labels and some of the
challenges around policy enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give a little background on my guests
at a personal level, Sunny Summers is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Policy Coordinator for the
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunny has a degree from Oregon State
University in bioresource research.
[SPEAKER_02]: She worked in pesticide regulation and
enforcement for 12 years before making the
[SPEAKER_02]: leap to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When not scratching her head over cannabis
regulations, she can be found napping in
[SPEAKER_02]: the woods, kayaking on the Willamette,
or chasing one of the Bruiser Brothers
[SPEAKER_02]: around the Sassy Sunflower House.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Haynes is a graduate of California
State Polytechnic University, Pomona with
[SPEAKER_02]: a BS in agronomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been with the Oregon Department of
Agriculture for 20 years and the
[SPEAKER_02]: department's fertilizer program for 18
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt reviews product labels for
registration, conducts marketplace
[SPEAKER_02]: inspections, collects and compiles tonnage
data, and reviews laboratory sample data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to joining the department,
Matt was with the JM Smucker Company and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mission Resource Conservation District.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Matt and Sunny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit more about
your roles at the ODA and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: programs that you're involved in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Sunny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the Oregon Department of Ag's
Cannabis Policy Coordinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that involves marijuana and
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently am helping write the rules for
our industrial hemp program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also work really closely with the Oregon
Liquor Control Commission, which has the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary authority for adult use cannabis
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also liaison with the Oregon Health
Authority, who does all the medical as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as testing rules in relation to adult
use cannabis and medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also work with the industry,
helping them figure out who they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to, may not be our agency or who
within our agency they would need to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt, I know I've actually worked with
you in getting some of our soils
[SPEAKER_02]: registered in Oregon a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about your
role with the ODA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am with the department's fertilizer
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer regulation is quite old,
actually, much older than the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: program here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to prior to the creation of
the agency, which was in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my role here is as a fertilizer
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm reviewing product labeling that is
submitted for registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm conducting marketplace inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out in the field and see if folks
are compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also review a lot of lab data that we
generate here internally in the department
[SPEAKER_00]: from product that's been sampled in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the program's goal is consumer
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that the consumer
receives what they pay for and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get things that they shouldn't have
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to touch on that a
little bit later in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to start off with sort of a
general question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of challenges do you see for
cannabis growers within this relatively
[SPEAKER_02]: new regulated market?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sunny, I know there's probably been a
lot on the policy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt, I know you've seen things with
the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that that sort of sparks
in terms of particular things that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the perspective, taking a step back
of the agency, we kind of have a dual
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we do it pretty well in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the department is tasked with both
regulating the agricultural industry as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as promoting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason my position even exists
is our former director, Katie Koba,
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty forward thinking and really
wanted to treat all things cannabis the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as any other agricultural crop as
much as we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where some of the challenges
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to reframe them as opportunities
come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the OLCC, for example,
registers all growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we aren't the ones that are licensing
those marijuana growers, but yet they
[SPEAKER_01]: still need to work with us on pesticides
and fertilizers and agricultural water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having to work with multiple
agencies for some people can be really
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult, especially if they are not
coming from an ag background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the really awesome
things about the cannabis industry is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's brought together such a wide range of
people who are interested in the new
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell coworkers here, we've got our
typical tie dye Birkenstock wearing folks
[SPEAKER_01]: running the gamut all the way to former
investment bankers and insurance brokers,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who understand money, but don't
necessarily understand that agriculture is
[SPEAKER_01]: not a widget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I see some opportunities for
learning in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of those situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt, was there anything that you
wanted to add from a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we see over and over again in
this market is that you've got a long
[SPEAKER_00]: history of folks that operated outside the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they historically have done this
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have now brought that attitude in
or continue that attitude as the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: framework has been built around the
production of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they continue, and this isn't the grow,
I don't really work with growers
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly, but I work with input
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're continuing, a lot of them
continue this outlaw or bad boy attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do things they really should not
be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for part of it, it's the way they've
always done business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part of it is it gives them some
street cred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, look, our product works better than
everybody else's because the gamut doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's troublesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know I've vented to you in the
past about this because it is really a
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate the level of
testing that you are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if we just talk about fertilizer,
you released lab analysis, and you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this for years, even before,
I believe even before the canvas industry
[SPEAKER_02]: came under your jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the products we see,
what you talked about there, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: is someone will say, yes, I have this
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, I don't know, 332.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking at one of your old
ones from 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they may say, our product has a
proprietary phosphorus source that
[SPEAKER_02]: releases the phosphorus much more
efficiently than another product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're comparing two, three,
three, two products, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: only to find out that the available
phosphate that's actually in the product,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe instead of 3%, it may be 11%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're essentially making claims
around a much higher percentage of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient than what they're telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a grower perspective,
that's really confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really challenging because if
we're trying to regulate our nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient and fertigation program to the
plant itself, we really can't do that
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of numbers that are so far off
of what we think we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I would agree with that
wholly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer industry regulation,
as it evolved over the last 100 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: really was based on making sure the grower
received the minimum amount that was
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thought being that nobody's going to
give the product away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as they get the minimum,
if they go over, well, nobody's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that because they're not going to give
product away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dynamic's changed quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is over formulation and
non-disclosed ingredients, whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or pesticides in products that
may give a particular product an edge over
[SPEAKER_00]: a competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as Sunny noted, with kind of the
wink, wink attitude, hey, check it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to tell you exactly why,
but hey, it works and it works well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you guys are doing as an agency is
going in and sampling these products
[SPEAKER_02]: because when I submitted my product,
my soil, and registered as a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: because I made plant growth claims saying
it would help a plant grow, therefore it
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to be registered as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I did that, I also had to submit from
a lab a guaranteed analysis saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was at least this level of nutrient
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would set my product label
slightly below that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say we use the example of 332.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be something where my analysis
might be 3.2%, 3.1%, and 2.2%,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would say my product's at 332.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you're doing is going back
in and sampling that product at some point
[SPEAKER_02]: to see if I met those guarantees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like I stated previously,
the process has been to make sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, Ted, your product met the minimums
and much of state regulatory activity has
[SPEAKER_00]: been based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also starting to go the other
direction now to make sure that you've not
[SPEAKER_00]: over-formulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply for, in a large degree,
water quality issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got product that's not accurate
as to the label and it's being applied
[SPEAKER_00]: over a large swath of ground, that can
impact water quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really important point,
especially around the use of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: and phosphates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a big challenge in the
canvas industry as it's something that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion, we tend to massively
over-apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's great that you're
looking out for water quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else around fertilizer
registration that you would think is
[SPEAKER_02]: important for growers to know from a
grower perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that pops into my mind is I
wasn't aware that you only have to put
[SPEAKER_02]: something on the label if you're
guaranteeing the analysis of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when we're talking about
macronutrients, I just know from my label
[SPEAKER_02]: it's NPK and calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make a guarantee around sulfur,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to test the sulfur in
my product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's some reason we would think
that it could be harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur typically wouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get an element like boron that if
that product was well over-formulated with
[SPEAKER_00]: boron, you could create some phytotoxic
effects that could harm a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will sometimes look for components,
nutritive components, that aren't listed
[SPEAKER_00]: but we may suspect might be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this all just random sampling or is
it complaint-based as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you go about choosing which
products you're sampling?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is random.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're in the marketplace conducting
inspections, we'll pick up product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a history on
manufacturers that don't necessarily meet
[SPEAKER_00]: their guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to focus in on that
manufacturer more if we find that
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly they don't meet their
guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, occasionally we do get
complaints whether it's we don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're formulating with as much phosphate
as they should or they're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: different form or hey, by the way,
I used to work for this company and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting Ethafon in this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to go look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so take me through what happens if you
do find a violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it often depends on how far up the
quote ladder they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to the point where we take
some very low level enforcement action.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they repeat, we can go up to civil
penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they continue to repeat, we can cancel
product registrations and place stop sales
[SPEAKER_00]: on the product found in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so it doesn't start with a stop sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's further down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for lab violations, we always give
folks the benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we continue to sample and see it
violate, violate, violate, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can issue a stop sale, which would
legally prohibit the sale or distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's talking fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we move to pesticides,
does that change on the stop sale side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I used to be in the pesticide
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually what is going to happen is if we
run into a situation where we think a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide is contaminated or has an active
ingredient that isn't listed on the label,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is kind of what you're
getting at, we're going to go pull a few
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles ourselves and have those analyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we've received a
complaint, maybe a grower used a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: something happened, they have their plant
material tested, and it came up positive
[SPEAKER_01]: for an active ingredient that they didn't
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they narrow it down and think,
okay, this is the product that it might
[SPEAKER_01]: have come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't rely on their test results for
enforcement purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really needs to be something that we
sampled ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what the chain of custody is from
that point of sale to our lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the lab analyzes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get results that are positive for an
active ingredient not on the label,
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point we would issue a stop sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, aren't you the agency that found
Guardian Mite Spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was a big one that,
you know, I got samples of that back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day and I fortunately didn't apply it
to my plants, but a lot of growers were
using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Oregon, and I think the Washington
rules are quite similar, all cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be tested for about 59 different
pesticide active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Guardian was under our old testing
rules for just medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was a grower who was taking his
plant material in and it tested positive
[SPEAKER_01]: for an active ingredient that he didn't
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually the private lab that
contacted us because they had a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different growers who were saying that
they were testing positive for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them used it and they were
starting to point fingers at him as having
[SPEAKER_01]: lab contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he took it upon himself to kind of
sit down with them and figure out what all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out Guardian was the common
thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had it tested, came up positive,
referred that to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went out, like I said, and purchased
our own new bottles of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And determined that it did have that
chemical in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really positive thing in my
mind that the cannabis industry has
[SPEAKER_01]: brought to all of agriculture is we've
actually had a handful of those situations
[SPEAKER_01]: since the testing rules went into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important to not have
products adulterated with another active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just cannabis that that affects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially some of them were OMRI listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were ones that people expected
were legal and appropriate for use on
[SPEAKER_01]: organic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the active ingredients that they were
contaminated with are not allowed under
[SPEAKER_01]: the National Organic Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really opened up, I think,
all the regulator's eyes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer's eyes throughout the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think you bring up a really good
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need this level of testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting way too much trust on
manufacturers to be delivering what they
[SPEAKER_02]: said they were delivering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been proven over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Guardian is just one example.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one that pops to mind is Mighty
Wash, this alkaline water that was
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly killing mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turned out that there were other
ingredients in there, like I believe it
[SPEAKER_02]: was parithrins in that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this level of trust, we're assuming
that, as a grower, we're assuming that the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer is telling us the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're assuming that all these
products are being tested by the
[SPEAKER_02]: government, when in reality, it's a little
bit more of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of something in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do catch people like this,
I think that just shows the need that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have for agencies like yours to exist,
because it's just so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece that I always tell folks
when I'm giving a presentation is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I use Guardian as an example,
it was $410 or so, I think, for a 16-ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was what the EPA called the 25B
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it had naturally occurring ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like lemongrass and
cinnamon oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they listed all the other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the requirement to fall
underneath that 25B, which means they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to go through the full
registration process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're paying $410 for Thai food,
that if you read the reviews on the
[SPEAKER_01]: website, works the first time against
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you, but my BS meter is
off the scale for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something sounds too good to be
true, it probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's similar to the wash products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wash products typically have a pretty
steep price on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kept often in the glass case in
the front of the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the product, at least
disclosed on the label, is inactive
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder why it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for listeners that aren't familiar,
as I understand it, and I hope you correct
[SPEAKER_02]: me if I misstate anything, the 25B list is
any product that's considered safe for
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the first example that pops
into my mind that may have some known
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticidal properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then by using those sorts of products
in your product, you don't have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through the full EPA registration,
which is a really challenging,
[SPEAKER_02]: long process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something has that EPA registration,
they've already gone through all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of these products just fall
under the 25B list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you, some of my
entomologist friends just will not use
[SPEAKER_02]: products on the 25B list for the most
part, just because they're not as well
[SPEAKER_02]: tested and they're not as well reviewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of their actual effects on insect
populations and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a very set list of active
ingredients that are allowed under the
[SPEAKER_01]: 25B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exemption from federal registration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if lavender's on there,
but things like thyme oil, cinnamon oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: some zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a pretty limited list.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put it together back in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not ever going to add to it is
what they've told me in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only do they have to pull an
active ingredient off that list,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to pull the other ingredients or
inerts off of what they call the 4A list,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is minimal risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then unlike other pesticide products,
they have to tell you everything that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most pesticides, you'll see the active
ingredient and other ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they don't ever tell you what those
other ingredients are.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to qualify for 25B, they have to
tell you everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, they don't go through
the full EPA registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do, however, have to be registered at
least in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Washington also registers 25Bs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our staff review those labels to
make sure they're not making wild claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't claim to control public health
pests, which are typically going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: things, bacteria and such in hospice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mosquito control claims, you know,
vector type insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can't be for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and there's some question in
folks' minds about how efficacious they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: How well do they work against whatever
pests they say they're going to work on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for clarifying that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you see a lot of 25B products at
trade shows, for example, for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I see most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all make pretty amazing claims,
usually verbally, to the grower that's
[SPEAKER_02]: standing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would encourage people to do their
own research on a lot of these products,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so many of them on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reason that you're going
to see a lot of 25B products are there is
[SPEAKER_01]: no EPA registered pesticide for anything
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That specifically lists that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's actually listed pesticides
to kill ditch weed, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to control a pest specifically listed
doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of those situations you
were asking earlier about challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government hasn't recognized
cannabis as a legal crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, research as to what amount of
residue you can have on it when you
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: What rate do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt was talking about phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a really big deal with
cannabis, especially indoor grown where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're under those very strong lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does that active ingredient stay
on the plant material?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what is done in order to get a
product registered with the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in Oregon, we came up with a list
of products that would not be illegal for
[SPEAKER_01]: use on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means they have really broad
label language.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're allowed on food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those 25Bs, they just say,
you can use it on any food crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And food crops are really the most
restrictive outside of public health pests
[SPEAKER_01]: for how you use a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EPA traditionally would set what they
call tolerances.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a residue level that can be on that
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look at potential exposure in the
short term and for the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is our potential for chronic long
term health effects if we were to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: that active ingredient over the course of
our lifetime?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have models that they put into
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take into account more sensitive
populations, young children, the elderly,
[SPEAKER_01]: pregnant women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come up with a value that
they feel is protective of human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that has been done on the cannabis
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any research on how these
pesticides are affected when combusted and
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaled through the lungs at all versus
food products that are obviously consumed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get people saying,
well, why can't I use what they use on
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there's very few pyrolysis
studies, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens when you burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's not a lot of information
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know something like myclobutanil,
based on private lab studies, turns into
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen cyanide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one that the cannabis
industry needs to be aware of because
[SPEAKER_01]: myclobutanil is a fungicide that
historically would be used off label on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine on your grape leaves that you're
not rolling up and smoking, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: but may not be so great when a BIC lighter
is hot enough to convert whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: myclobutanil is on there into hydrogen
cyanide and you're now breathing that into
[SPEAKER_01]: your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and even with tobacco, the EPA has
looked at it and said, well, if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide residue on tobacco, that's
probably the least of your concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're inhaling a known carcinogen into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a little bit of residue
pesticide, again, not your biggest problem
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've kind of taken a hands off
approach even there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They absolutely stopped looking at chronic
long-term exposure on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only regulate it for acute exposure
for those folks who are applying it while
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in the ground or working with the
plant material when it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I like to throw out,
I don't give tobacco juice to medically
[SPEAKER_01]: compromised children.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are giving cannabis to medically
compromised children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to be protective of the
most vulnerable population that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: using this crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that don't know,
the most common myclobutanil product is
[SPEAKER_02]: Eagle 20, just the consumer name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the name people are most familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have heard the argument that,
well, it's used in vineyards and grapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is an edible crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why couldn't we use it on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're using such a small amount that
it really isn't going to have any effect
[SPEAKER_02]: on the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it makes growing a heck of a lot
easier when you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew or botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad that that information is
getting out there and people are becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: more aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that really relates more to the
consumer side than the grower side,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a lot of trust there on
the part of the consumer that these
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are following all the rules,
too, which is a whole other side of
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement that we could talk about,
too, that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something to consider, too,
is the routes of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a pesticide material that
dermal exposure is very, it's not water
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble, it's not going to get into your
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Sunny mentioned, you combust that,
you chemically change it, and that route
[SPEAKER_00]: through inhalation could be a huge,
huge impact on your health where,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, having some on your skin may not be
a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eating it might not be an issue
because your stomach helps break down
[SPEAKER_01]: those chemicals before it gets into your
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you inhale something, your lungs are
an immediate conduit to the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know that we can say it's
going to be horrible, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: precautionary principle says we haven't
studied that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the likelihood is that that could be a
very toxic exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think the customers are
interested in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is regulated and they feel that
folks are following those directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a more, there's a sense of
confidence when you walk into a regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: store versus meeting the guy on the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so speaking of pesticides,
what are you seeing in terms of lab
[SPEAKER_02]: results in regards to concentrations of
these pesticides as cannabis gets
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated down into things like wax or
rosin or oils?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing much higher levels of
pesticides in those products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Matt and I don't see those lab
results, so I'm not sure I can speak
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligently to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, any time you concentrate the
cannabinoids, you're going to concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: any other chemical that's on there,
including the pesticides, which is why
[SPEAKER_01]: most states have a pesticide testing
program in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, the raw plant material is
tested and the bulk oils would be tested
[SPEAKER_01]: for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 59 different active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we can just put something in
a little vial and say, tell me everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I don't know, 1,300 or more
different pesticide active ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: registered in products in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to find all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not easy lab samples to run in
addition to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state kind of had to limit what
they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in theory, if a grower was using a
pesticide that was not one of those 59 you
[SPEAKER_02]: were testing for, it could still be making
it through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, like Matt was talking about
earlier, employees who do not have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: working relationship with their boss or
who have left a company, many times will
[SPEAKER_01]: call and let us know if there's something
potentially hinky going on at a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do follow up on those kind of
complaints as well and not just the test
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a confidential process,
just out of curiosity?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how that employee presents
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to remain confidential,
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will not be able to follow up
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we can provide them with a case
number though, if they want to call back
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, tell me what happened with case
number, such and such, then we can provide
[SPEAKER_01]: them the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that public information if you do
have violations on the cultivation side
[SPEAKER_02]: like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that are information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information is public available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks just have to make a request in order
to receive it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're talking about pesticides,
I saw you have an alert right now on your
[SPEAKER_02]: website about pyrethrins and I think you,
how do you, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: PPO?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
PPO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pipernil butoxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pyrethrins are a naturally occurring
pesticide derived from chrysanthemum
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PBO is what they call a synergist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has some pesticidal activity,
meaning it kills insects, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily included in there because due to
the fact that pyrethrins are naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring, they break down very quickly in
the environment and insects can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: develop some resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the PBO is included in that
formulation to help the pyrethrin be more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective against the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nerve agent in insects and the PBO
helps keep the insect from metabolizing it
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it actually is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, the Oregon Health Authority
established what pesticides cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at what products were folks in
the industry likely to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: What products did we know had been
historically used like the Eagle 20?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they came up with their
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, ODA's list of what products are not
illegal to use are ones that have either
[SPEAKER_01]: no tolerance, some of them like
pyrethrins, EPA has said is low enough in
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it up to the day of harvest
and we're not going to be concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: residue levels on the crops that it's used
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got onto our list because it met our
criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the products that have that in there
that have label language that is broad
[SPEAKER_01]: enough that we can allow it for use on
cannabis are allowed on our list.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those situations where not
having extension service or companies
[SPEAKER_01]: doing research, we don't know what happens
on cannabis when you apply pyrethrins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what happens on squash and cabbage
and all of those things and we know it
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a cool, unique plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible that it doesn't happen the
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some growers have failed for
pyrethrins and or PBO who use the product
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the label directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have the alert out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it your own caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some remediation options
available just for pyrethrins and PBO that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available for other active ingredients if
they can show that they used a product on
[SPEAKER_01]: the guide list and according to the label
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of kind of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we get research into the plant,
you know, good agronomic research,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to know why that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of this information is available
on your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a there's a PDF you can download
on the differences between pyrethrins and
[SPEAKER_02]: pyrethroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the alert on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage all listeners to go and
sign up for the email alerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get all the stop sale information
whenever new analysis come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the work that the ODA
is doing around sharing this information
[SPEAKER_02]: with growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to I wanted to change
direction, though, a little bit and ask a
[SPEAKER_02]: question for Matt regarding the microbial
analysis that has been done by the ODA as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at a test from 2015 and I can
tell you that these tests have been highly
[SPEAKER_02]: debated in forums online based on the
results you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you can explain a little
bit about that program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bacteria and fungi have been
guaranteed in for lack of a better way of
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it fertilizer products for a number
of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike the chemical constituents,
nitrogen, boron, zinc, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: no state had been actively looking at
these components during marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's common for a product to be
tested, you know, somebody finds it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it back, send it to our regulatory
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see if it's got all of the
available phosphate that it's guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, boron, zinc, copper, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no state had been looking at microbial
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back around 2013, Oregon, right now
we're the only state that is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to do some very rudimentary
testing using simple, very simple dilution
[SPEAKER_00]: plating to look at bacillus, trichodermis,
pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we find these bacteria and simple
fungi in the product at the levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're guaranteed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And overwhelmingly, we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also retained a well-known mycologist
in Corvallis, Oregon, to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
such as glomas or gigaspora.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking at are the spores there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the root fragments there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it meet its guarantee of spores or
propagules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it a little better there, but for the
most part, products are not meeting their
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantees for the mycorrhizal fungi
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of it is, for years and
years, folks have been able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantees unchecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling them on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's gonna shake up the way
the industry promotes and guarantees
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found that bacteria or fungi that
are of human health concern as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now we're looking at such a
high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Oregon law requires
identification by genus and species and
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, if relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're looking at just the
species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if they guarantee 10
combos of bacillus, so bacillus subtilis,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus cereus, et cetera, et cetera,
all the way down, all we're doing right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is looking at how many bacillus are in
that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're failing, again, almost
universally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability to look at the
species, but if you can't crawl yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no reason to see if you can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets to a point where products meet
their guarantees, we can go to the species
[SPEAKER_00]: level and see if they have harmful,
potentially human pathogens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're not there,
not even close to being there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really interesting question,
Sonny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just assume that these products are
safe because they're being packaged and
[SPEAKER_02]: sold by a commercial company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't even really occur to me that
something might have human health impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, my initial thought was just I was
amazed that these products weren't being
[SPEAKER_02]: detected, or these microbes weren't being
detected on the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the label right now from
2015 for piranha with advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they claim to have mycorrhizal fungus,
pseudomonas and trichoderma, $55 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: CFU of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you didn't detect any of those things
in the product at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are paying through the roof for
these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how expensive they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you touched on that on the
pesticides thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping we're going to get more
accountability of these manufacturers on
[SPEAKER_02]: the products that they're providing to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do need more of this microbial
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we're not entirely clear right
now is, again, let's make the assumption
[SPEAKER_00]: of benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not positive that there is one
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, again, we're looking at
content, not necessarily benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure that we're going in the
right direction in terms of guaranteeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, trichoderma at $55 million
colony forming units per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right thing to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We enforce law that is written by the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes with assistance from the
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's drafted by the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That law says that these products have to
guarantee genus and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more and more evidence that
points to it's not specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma, harzianum, live fungi that
you really want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the stuff that trichoderma harzianum
secretes as it's growing and living and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying that you want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: No clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: No clue whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, then we're barking up
the wrong tree by saying, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have a genus and species
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, if the magic stuff
that these bacteria and fungi secrete is
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown, then how do you make a level and
fair playing field amongst products?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a struggle right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the challenge I see is as a grower
or someone who's be purchasing these
[SPEAKER_02]: products, I need something quantifiable
that I can compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm looking at two products and
one offers me the glomus interatuses or
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizophagus interatuses at, say,
50 spores per gram and another one
[SPEAKER_02]: guarantees 500 spores per gram and they're
the same price, my initial thought is to
[SPEAKER_02]: go with the one where I'm getting more,
essentially what seems like more product
[SPEAKER_02]: for my money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're finding is that maybe
these claims on the labels are really not
[SPEAKER_02]: all that accurate to where what you're
getting is nowhere near what you thought
[SPEAKER_02]: you were paying for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a little different though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking, what you mentioned were
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the processes there are much more well
known in that you need to, so if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: glomus or gigaspore or whatever it happens
to be, the idea there is you want that
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi to infect a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need that spore or that propagule,
whether it's an infected root fragment
[SPEAKER_00]: that you add.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need specific infection,
it infects, you get that awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal association in the soil that
expands your root zone, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products are a little more easy to
quantify because we're counting spores,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're counting root fragments,
whatever, to make propagules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the bacteria such as bacillus or
pseudomonas or what we refer to as simple
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi like trichoderma, they all can
excrete VOCs, volatile organic compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever nature they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much less clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of ways they can promote
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are pesticidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually act on other pathogens in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can excrete compounds that can
solubilize, let's say iron or phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could excrete compounds that could
actually get into the plant and signal in
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathways, metabolic pathways in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have a good understanding of
these compounds they secrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you don't understand the
compounds, how do you quantify them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially what you're saying is maybe
the current way that we are regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: these products because we don't know the
effects of these microbes or how they act
[SPEAKER_02]: on plants that really for certain species
it may not be the most accurate way of
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling or quantifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enforce statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enforce Oregon law, and that's the way
it's written right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be the best way, or it may be
the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're starting at this
quantification stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody says there's bacillus subtilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see if there's bacillus in this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know, Tad, are these
products truly effective, or is it a
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is $250 a liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got 55 different genus and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much good work has been
done out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that any has really been done
with off-the-shelf product to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: to evaluate the content first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't meet its guarantees, and then let's
use it per the label directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we seeing an agronomic benefit to
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we get a better crop yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we get some other quantifiable effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or again, is it just placebo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, the Grow magazine say this is what
you use for whatever results you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard, peer-reviewed science just isn't
there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think another point that you
bring up that's good to mention is that
[SPEAKER_02]: just because a product makes your list of
something that's approved for use is not
[SPEAKER_02]: in any way condoning it in terms of
efficacy or the ODA saying you should use
[SPEAKER_02]: this product in your cultivation
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that according to the way it's
structured from a legal perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're allowed to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true on pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have a list for fertilizers,
just to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our registered product list,
and we say that these products have met
[SPEAKER_00]: the requirements in Oregon law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an endorsement that hey,
this will work or give you some benefit at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's to keep a company then from
putting out a product and just not listing
[SPEAKER_02]: any microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting out a micro product and just
saying there's microbes in there without
[SPEAKER_02]: listing or making any claims in terms of
the guarantees of the products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to claim microbial
content in any way, shape, or form,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's on the physical product label
or via web presence or brochures or
[SPEAKER_00]: flyers, they can't unless they make a
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't stop them from putting a
microbial component in there and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing about it because we won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're going to say microbes,
then they have to guarantee microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like we've done a good job of
talking about the test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, are you guys going to be
coming out with any new lab tests like
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been a little while since the
last sort of series of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any more in the works that we can
look forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have them in the works
continually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we take samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our process is to make sure that all
enforcement actions are completely wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: up because any enforcement we take,
the recipient has legal rights and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can challenge the results we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to make sure they've exhausted
all of the rights that they wish to
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise before we post anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we test every year and we have
reports for 17 calendar year and 18
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar year that are written up just
waiting for enforcement to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would encourage listeners to go on
the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they haven't seen these results,
it's freely available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason you shouldn't go there
and see if the products you're using have
[SPEAKER_02]: been tested and see what results the
Oregon Department of Agriculture got when
[SPEAKER_02]: they tested the products you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's free information out there
and I think people need to access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you, it's going to be more of
the same, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same him, different verse.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so like different companies,
same results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, results are not getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that you guys want
to talk about or share with listeners,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunny on the policy side or Matt on the
fertilizer side that we didn't talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking at cannabis in general,
it's still evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in Oregon and I think it's true
in other states, every time our
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature is enchanting in town,
something changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the agency has to go into
rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking a step back, the legislature
passes a bill that becomes the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the agency going to implement the
law?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the rules that we put forth that
goes through a public comment period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a public involved process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately, that's what Matt's
program is enforcing off of is the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's been a wild ride with
cannabis and it's going to continue to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our legislature will be starting here
on the 22nd of January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an odd year, so it's a full
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means hang on to your your hats
and we're going to be working at the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature until June.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the goal is always consumer safety and
consumer protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're always working towards that
goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: As as it goes, it sounds like from what
you're describing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, and specifically with
cannabis, you know, there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: other other moving pieces with the other
agencies and, you know, law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns and federal concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that affects the industry and it
affects, you know, it feels confusing and
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels like things are changing all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The agencies are feeling that pain as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to be an evolving
process for a number of years as we start
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also why I call it,
you know, opportunities rather than just
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges is when do you get to be part
of a brand new industry like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is exciting to be involved in something
that is an emerging market in an emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all we're learning so much every
year that about this plant and optimal
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw in a couple of comments here,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Sonny's talking about emerging
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet on on my side of the of the aisle,
the fertilizer side, we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: definite contraction in the number of grow
shops that are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots have closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing suppliers, smaller suppliers
of products that are no longer renewing
[SPEAKER_00]: their registrations or out of business
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry took a big, at least on my
end of things, took a big hit in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that was just due to the
over oversupply of cannabis to the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational market by growers and then
also the the movement towards online sales
[SPEAKER_02]: for hydro shops and and going straight to
the manufacturer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if why why would I grow ahead of
lettuce at home, go through all the effort
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing ahead of lettuce at home when I
can go to five different stores within a
[SPEAKER_00]: mile radius of my house and buy it cheaper
than I can I can grow it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to have folks that
home garden and want to to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's just a lot of folks
that are not buying those input products
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've either reduced their
operation size or like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big oversupply of product in
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the markets change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one of our our our registrants here
in Oregon when I was at an inspection a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years ago who did not want to
see legalization happen because he felt it
[SPEAKER_00]: would impact his business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, it's impacting his
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope maybe people listening to this
podcast today will realize some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: importance behind possibly growing their
own in the sense that they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily trust everything that's on the
market as it stands right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what we're learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do appreciate you guys working
towards keeping keeping products safe and
[SPEAKER_02]: really trying to push, you know,
manufacturers to provide safe product and
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate product and then cultivators to
do the same with the with the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's never it's it'll never go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I grow tomatoes at home because I
find the tomatoes in the grocery store
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always going to have folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're always going to want to do it
themselves to either because they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow things or they want to grow a variety
that they can't find or they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fiddle around in many, many ways that they
can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't think we're going to go
back to to the mid 2000s where the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: was totally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted a reliable known source,
you were going to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just want to say thank you for
your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your willingness as a government agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agency to come on the podcast and share
this information with with cultivators and
[SPEAKER_02]: take time out of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything else you wanted to add
before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just add, like you said,
have folks go look at the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt and I contact information is there or
you're welcome to provide our contact
[SPEAKER_01]: information on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if folks have follow up questions,
send them our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're happy to chat with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's the best way for people to
to know what is happening and get the the
[SPEAKER_01]: true information, because I find there's a
lot of rumors that go around in these
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: A universal for at least my program is the
more folks talk to us, the less problems
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would rather have someone reach out
to you at the beginning before applying a
[SPEAKER_02]: product or before getting to a situation
where they might be in trouble rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: going the other direction.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to we want to help you on the
front end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to come back you with a
stick on the back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I haven't met you at Sunny,
but I can tell you that Matt was very
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful for me with on the fertilizer
registration side, because as a new
[SPEAKER_02]: company trying to register a soil and I
know soil sort of for this new part of
[SPEAKER_02]: within the fertilizer industry,
too, it was a huge challenge for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was very, very helpful and spent
time on the phone sort of explaining label
[SPEAKER_02]: claims and how to structure everything and
what needed to be on there and what
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate it made the
process so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Sunny Summers and Matt Haynes
with the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do go to their website and add
yourself to the mailing list for all
[SPEAKER_02]: updates regarding new information,
stop sales and their testing results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted the links to the ODA site and
information related to this podcast right
