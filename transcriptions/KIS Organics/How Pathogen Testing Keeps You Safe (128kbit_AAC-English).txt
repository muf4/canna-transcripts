[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, so today I want to talk to you
about pathogen testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogen testing is a great tool to
determine if you're dealing with an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: like Fusarium, Pythium, or Hoplate
Enviroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: HLVD is a significant pathogen affecting
cannabis and the symptoms of HLVD are
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted growth, chlorosis, and necrosis in
some cases, commonly thought of as dudding
[SPEAKER_00]: is what you hear a lot of people talk
about in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to note that infected
plants may not show any visible symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: at all, which is why early detection is
crucial and it can actually show up in
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds now too, though at much lower rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing your plants is the best way to
know if this is a potential issue or to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid bringing something into your garden
that could be an issue down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we offer testing through Three Rivers
Biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost per test are only $15 per test,
but there is a five test minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you order your test, here's the
supplies and the process for submitting a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got this in the mail and I wanted to
show you guys the whole process and take
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it as well as what comes in
the kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And opening it up, I have my sample tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I'll put my sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an envelope for packaging and
mailing that sample back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have my instructions from them
on how to take a sample and I'll walk
[SPEAKER_00]: through this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as my sheet for recording my
sample with the barcode that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: match up with the plant that I'm testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a list of supplies that you're
going to need in order to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need scissors or pruning
shears, bleach, a spray bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towels, a pen, disposable gloves,
and a cooler with ice inside or fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cooler over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm actually just going to take the
samples and put them directly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is to sterilize your
scissors in a 10% bleach solution for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 10 minutes and then wipe dry with a
fresh paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my scissors are now ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step that they want you to do is
to fill out this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to write the name of the
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's Gary Payton crossed
with animal mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to put G-P-X-A-M.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to take my barcode here
and I'm going to stick it right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: form like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to take the
corresponding barcode, so 0157,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to stick it on the plant
that I'm sampling today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could stick this on a pot stick or
you can stick it right on the fabric pot
[SPEAKER_00]: here, right like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've done all of those steps,
the next step is to put on your disposable
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves, or you can already have them on,
and spray your gloves really quickly with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of bleach solution,
10% bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do it away from my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure my hands are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step is to take my
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the sample here, you need your
sample length to be less than a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: inch, so not very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking, this is a quarter inch
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole sample that's going into the
vial tube needs to be less than a full
[SPEAKER_00]: inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the important part of this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to go over here and take
my sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to gently peel back the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: To expose these lateral roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take some from a few
different spots in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to have to cut some of these
down because they're just too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now that I have my samples and
I've cut them down to the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: size, less than a quarter inch per sample,
per root, and then total sample size of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the roots is less than an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting all of them into the sample
vial and then they recommend moving it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and down like that and then turning it
like 10 to 20 times just to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots are fully coated with the sample
solution in there that will help stabilize
[SPEAKER_00]: it for the trip to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm putting on the barcode that
goes with that particular sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to figure out the best way
to do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to put it on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will allow the lab to match
that particular root sample with that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular plant that I pulled the sample
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to record that on the sample
sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to get that directly
into the refrigerator for 24 hours to let
[SPEAKER_00]: it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking that and sending it to the
post office, filling it out with the
[SPEAKER_00]: address on the sheet and getting that to
the lab right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really the best and frankly the
only way to find out if your plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: poplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to know what
you're dealing with when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about pathogens so you can treat it
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
