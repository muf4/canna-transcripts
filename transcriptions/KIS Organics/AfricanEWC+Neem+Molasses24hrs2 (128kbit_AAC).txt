[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the African compost with the
molasses and the neem, and I've seen like
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five of these really wide fungal
hyphae structures in this sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just wanted to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only at 100 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering exactly what the effects of
the neem are on the soil, but when I added
[SPEAKER_00]: that and the molasses, so you can see
there's just a ton of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is at 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the widest diameter fungi I've
seen on any of my testing so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm zooming in now so you can see there's
a ton of bacteria as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at 400 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta say, this surprised me quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not expect to find this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we can safely say that the
addition of neem cake watered in is
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not killing the microbes in our
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be increasing them,
especially when I look at it with molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
So, thank you very much for watching,
and I'll see you next time.
