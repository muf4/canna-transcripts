[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here with Suzanne Wainwright-Evans,
and we're talking about various pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna start off talking about
the root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about that in
relation to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna say everybody has it,
but I think almost everybody has it at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I wanted us to kind of
start here is because I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted through Instagram several times
a day, which is fine, but people are
[SPEAKER_00]: sending me pictures of their root aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I've had a few situations where
people have actually been treating for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years thinking they had root
aphids and they're not root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, it's either a fungus gnats or
now I'm actually having a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: get mites confused with root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, mites have eight legs as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: When mites are first born, they only have
six, but then when they molt, they'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, when they're first hatched
out of the eggs, people don't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see them till they're later in
life and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll have eight legs where
insects, which is what aphids are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll always just have six legs and then
their antenna.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't count their antenna as legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've gotta start there because
how we manage mite issues is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different in how we manage aphid issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually, I'm saving a whole file on
my computer of things people have thought
[SPEAKER_00]: were root aphids that aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concern is people are doing all
these Bavaria drenches or Isaria using
[SPEAKER_00]: these two different fungi, which we're
using for root aphid management,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't really do anything for
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just people are wasting a lot of
money and a lot of products going out when
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kinda why I wanted to talk about
them a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so tell me a little bit about their
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned already the adults,
the flying adults look a lot like fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats and people are confusing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've had a tough time looking at a
sticky card telling them apart unless they
[SPEAKER_01]: were side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the key
characteristics throughout the etymology
[SPEAKER_01]: of the life cycle of this pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with fungus gnats, when they're adults,
they all fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae are white maggots in the soil
and they have a black head capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you can tell fungus gnats
larva from other fly species in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically they bounce around on the
soil surface and they have this very weird
[SPEAKER_00]: little flight pattern they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why when we put out sticky
cards for fungus gnats, we typically have
[SPEAKER_00]: them closer to the soil profile and not up
in the high top part of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy is where we put more for things
like thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But down towards the soil, that's where
you can find the fungus gnats bouncing
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids, most of the time they don't have
wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop wings when it's time for them
to disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically what I'm seeing,
especially in cannabis, but this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: true because there are several species of
root aphids and there's some that attack
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, some attack ornamentals,
some attack cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically they all kind of hang out in
the soil until there's either an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental cue or something like the
population gets too high and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time for them to disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's happening in cannabis
is people think, oh my gosh, in flower we
[SPEAKER_00]: have this massive all of a sudden root
aphid issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the numbers have been really
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been hanging in the soil,
reproducing, feeding on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not developing wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they get to a certain number
or environmental cues may play into this
[SPEAKER_00]: too, which we don't know yet, but they
decide, okay, now we're gonna have babies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are gonna develop wings and then
that's when you see them coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and dispersing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may be like, oh no, I've seen them
crawling around with no wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're seeing are immatures that
haven't developed their wings yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just at a facility a few weeks ago
and we collected a bunch of root aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: and we looked at them under my dino light.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I got a new dino light,
I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can actually see what are called
wing pads and that's where the aphid wings
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna develop from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you don't see full blown
wings on them, you can see on the immature
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids where the wings are going to
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something that as you look
at aphids over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see these aphids that are
climbing around by the hundreds or
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at them, you can see these
wing pads and know that when they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to shed their skin into the next life
stage, when they get to the adult part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they will have wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take me through the life cycle of an
aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does it start?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for root aphids, it's a little
different than regular aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically aphids do a thing called
parthenogenesis and that means they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to mate to have babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically all their offsprings are
clones of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why there's a lot of problems
with insecticide resistance where people
[SPEAKER_00]: use the same product over and over,
natural pyrethrins, if you use them over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if mom developed resistance since her
offspring are clones of her, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have resistance too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it's very easy to
develop resistance in aphids and
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the female, when she is an adult,
she just sits there and will have live
[SPEAKER_00]: birth for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in warmer climates and inside of
greenhouses, we generally don't see them
[SPEAKER_00]: laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my entire life, I've only seen one
species do it and that's the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of doing their own weird
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about them in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside your greenhouse with cotton
melon, with your green peach, with even
[SPEAKER_00]: your root aphid, what you're seeing is
just one female just having live birth all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and they're clones of herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it just goes on year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're an outside producer of any
plants in the Northern climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do overwinter as eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the days get shorter and the
temperatures start to fall, aphids then
[SPEAKER_00]: actually will produce some male
offsprings, they'll mate and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: females lay eggs and then they overwinter
as eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, those hatch and
off to the races again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in protected environments where they
don't get those environmental cues,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just have babies year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work a lot in South Florida,
outside just babies year round kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, and we're not sure
exactly why yet, the cannabis aphid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual cannabis aphid, not aphids on
cannabis, but the species, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid, it actually, it is laying eggs
inside of greenhouses, but it,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, facilities that are using artificial
lighting and we're actually seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's when people are changing
their lighting and temperature to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to flower, that's triggering
the cannabis aphid to go into egg laying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like this one weird exception
we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen it in Canada, United States,
Southern, Western United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern, kind of all over this happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so with these live births,
you get these little tiny, are they
[SPEAKER_01]: considered, is that considered a larval
stage at that point or is it the actual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call it immature, but it looks just
like mom, but it's a miniature version
[SPEAKER_00]: because insects basically have two ways
that they can grow up and become adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have things like aphids that when
they're born, and they look just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: adults, they're just smaller versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time they molt, they get a little
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with stink bugs do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side of that, you have insects
like butterflies, the eggs are laid when
[SPEAKER_00]: they hatch out, their immature stage does
not look like the adult at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they actually have to go through
complete metamorphosis to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so caterpillars do that, flies do
that, beetles do it, ladybugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larva look like little black
alligators, they don't look like ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people see small ladybugs and
they're like, oh, it's a baby ladybug,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, no, that's the full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see a ladybug adult, they don't
grow any bigger than that because their
[SPEAKER_00]: immature stage are that little alligator
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it's so important to
know what the different life stages look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm spending a ton of time
teaching in my workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have an aphid in an egg,
when that hatches, does that hatch as a
[SPEAKER_01]: little baby clone as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have egg laying, generally
there's a male and a female, so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some genetic diversity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one has done this detailed of work
yet on the cannabis aphid because of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the limitations of who can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can study it and moving it and yada,
yada, yada, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so in terms of plant health and
plant damage with the cannabis aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the root aphid, are there any
distinguishing characteristics in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they still using the same mechanism
for feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all aphids have what's called a
piercing sucking mouth part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically have the plant wall here
and their mouth looks like a straw and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just stick it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they start feeding on the
plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't actually chew the plant or take
away pieces of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why historically systemic
pesticides have worked so well because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're moving in the liquid fluid of the
plant and you just tap your straw in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and you suck it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why systemics do work well on
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you know, it can lead right back to
a lot of resistance issues and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of crops we can't use systemics on and
including cannabis is when you definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be using a systemic on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I see with the root aphid is an
overall just decline in plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't look as vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color can be slightly off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stresses the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually when they're in like
propagation, the numbers are so low,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't notice it and it's over time as
the populations build and as the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: get closer to flower, all of a sudden you
have thousands of these aphids feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can really stress a plant,
especially add in any nutritional stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put disease, all these different
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically people are pushing cannabis
plants pretty hard to grow for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that we want and they're
pushing with fertilizer and that just adds
[SPEAKER_00]: into the stressors on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the cannabis aphid, they're
feeding on the foliage of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: that cause, and it's the same thing with
the other foliar aphid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're again, sticking their mouth
parts in, but you can see more
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when aphids feed, since they're
sucking up all these plant juices,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take them in a lot more sugar than
they actually need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens then is they're like,
well, I've got this extra sugar inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna squirt it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they actually will squirt out what
we call honeydew and it's the excess
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars they don't need as part of their
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually get sticky on the leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is oftentimes when you get ants
moving in, cause ants like to feed on that
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets really bad, you can get
what's called sooty mold growing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes people think they have
disease issue, but it's actually all
[SPEAKER_00]: related to what we call piercing sucking
insects, whether it be aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: white flies, and even some of the soft
scales can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen it with white flies and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we scouting for these various
aphid species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the root aphids, you need to be
scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just think everybody should be
treating in prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and this is, people don't do
enough treatment and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wait until the problem gets too bad
and it's, you don't wanna wait to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: for the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be scouting, but scouting
depending on how you're growing can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that use the large living soil
beds, you can't really scout for root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids because you can't get in there and
really see your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get the root aphids in there,
they just keep building and building and
[SPEAKER_00]: people end up fighting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they just try to keep them
suppressed in those soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the foliar aphids, you go by and if
you saw that video, I did an Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: while ago where you just bang the plant
onto the board, aphids will fall out too
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do that as well as thrips and
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an easy way to detect early
populations on the foliar feeding aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using a bang board to get the bang
aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you did there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know the ODA put out a report on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can link to that PDF.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some photos and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had a chance to see that
advisory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty good to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I can share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's a basic overview,
but the thing is, we still just don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to this whole egg laying thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time, again, I've ever seen
aphids lay eggs in a greenhouse and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: first time for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show the images to other entomologists
and everybody's like, whoa, because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody's seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a very unusual behavior about
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't even know what really will
feed on the eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume lacewing larva would feed
on them because lacewing larva will eat
[SPEAKER_00]: just about anybody and anything,
including their brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something when you are scouting
to be aware of because you won't readily
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize it as an aphid egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks more like a yellow to black,
almost really shiny Mike and Ike's candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Aureus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that feed on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It possibly would feed on it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my dream thing to do is to get a
bunch of the eggs, throw a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial instead of my scope for hours,
but you've got to have the eggs right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some treatment options that
you're aware of for root aphids or for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis aphid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about stuff, the root
aphid management in the past, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: listen closely because I had a lot of
people contacting me about it and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said things that I never said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in time, as in July 11th,
2019, we are not seeing success
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling it with any of what I call the
macro biocontrol agents, the row beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mites, any of those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you put a root aphid in a petri
dish with a row beetle, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to eat it, but it's not controlling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things work to control it,
it wouldn't be such an industry wide
[SPEAKER_00]: problem because everybody's dumping loads
of this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have seen, the best thing we've
got going right now are the microbial,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call the enema pathogenic fungi,
they're fungi that kill insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: products like botanogard or mycotrol,
which are the Bavaria bossiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the GHA strain has been
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm finding is when people say
I'm doing it, I'm not getting control,
[SPEAKER_00]: the product doesn't work, they suck,
they're not applying it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, for the 9 million times,
botanogard is not a GMO product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis industry, you know what,
I need my tin foil hat for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's actually upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a GMO product.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the microbials on the market right
now, they've selected them by saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this fungus works the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna use this, but it's not
genetically engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got people saying it, and it is not
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to fact check what you're saying
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, the Bavaria, as a drench
application, and remember the spores have
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in contact with the aphid,
it's not systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to get contact for it to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing good results with Isaria,
which is another genus of enema pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in the product like PFR 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you have to apply it correctly
and get contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you recommending applying this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was just interviewing a buddy of
mine, and he was using the, hold on,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me get this right, the DRAM BP4 with
an aftermarket five-headed telescopic
[SPEAKER_01]: atomizing lance for a lot of his spray
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily for microbial
applications, but how are you applying a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of products you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbials like the Bavaria or
Isaria, they work well on root aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: not foliar aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of somewhat complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus, when it's in the soil,
does a good job in the root aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for foliar aphids, it doesn't work
that well, because you really have to tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mix the fungus with an insect growth
regulator, which are IGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: IGRs basically disrupt insects from
becoming mature adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's like if a 14-year-old's
getting hammered with a compound that will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them from going through puberty kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically what insect growth
regulators do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very, very loose, the way I'm
explaining this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is when you have an
aphid, aphids shed their skin a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foliar aphids, and that's why you get
those white flakes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray and here lands your Bavaria
spore, boop, or your Isaria, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: whoop, it sheds its skin, there goes the
spore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tank mix it with an insect growth
regulator, it stops them from molting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that spore can't get molted off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're talking about using these
microbials for a foliar application,
[SPEAKER_00]: for aphids, you've got to have that IGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily for the root avid species,
because you have 100% humidity in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fungus works fast enough down
there, but on the foliage, you need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, is when you look at insect
growth regulators, most of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: disallowed in cannabis production,
with the one exception of azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what state you're in,
if you can use azadirachtin or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but azadirachtin is actually an insect
growth regulator that can be tank mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the microbials for better foliar
aphid management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the sprayer your buddy's
using, that's when you would use that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But treating for root aphids in the soil,
you need one of more like the drenching
[SPEAKER_00]: heads that is like a heavy water,
because you want to get a lot of water
[SPEAKER_00]: volume to get the fungal spores down into
the soil surface, into the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the soil profile, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm wondering though is,
how does an atomizer affect these spores?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, it's not damaging them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing that can damage spores
is heat, and that's why you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very careful with foggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Michael Brownbridge, if you guys don't
know him, you should know and follow his
[SPEAKER_00]: work up out of, he's with the Vineland
Research and Innovation Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, if you're coming to
Cultivate this weekend, I'm not sure when
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the podcast up, but Michael's
gonna be speaking on microbials this
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend, at Cultivate, as well as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a presentation on how to
integrate microbials with traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries to use them for biocontrol
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Michael Brownbridge has actually been
doing study, research up at the Vineland
[SPEAKER_00]: Research and Innovation Center,
looking at equipment and how does putting
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria bacillus and things like that
through this equipment and how does it
[SPEAKER_00]: affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, it's heat and pressure are
two of the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for just regular, sprayers,
it's usually not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with these foggers where they have
really high PSI and you get the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat cooks and kills them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I looked at, this was probably
almost a decade ago, I looked at some
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea through a fogger, and it
destroyed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the bacteria was- Yeah, well there's
cold foggers, and DRAM makes one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's the stuff, you can
probably put a link in this for the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that Michael's been doing on testing the
stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything else on aphids before we move
on to a different pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, just ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to help everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that because you guys are
taking full advantage of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just count legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has eight, it's a mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got six, it's a spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an insect if it has six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, if there's, you know,
antenna, insects have antenna.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just basic things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, I mean, I'm not gonna
completely promote myself, but yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: come to one of my classes that does basic
insect ID so that you guys can learn this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff. Okay.
