[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: science-based perspective and drawing top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_03]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guest this week is Dr. Eleanor Koontz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eleanor is a trained herbalist and
geneticist bridging the gap between
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional herbalism and modern science.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the CEO and co-founder of
LeafWorks, a botanical verification
[SPEAKER_03]: company using genetics to improve
medicinal quality, sustainability,
[SPEAKER_03]: and transparency in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is also co-founder of CANDOR,
the People's Herbarium, the first
[SPEAKER_03]: herbarium committed to documenting and
preserving cannabis cultivars and
[SPEAKER_03]: varietals along with the collective
knowledge gained through community
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is her second time on the show,
and if you are interested in learning more
[SPEAKER_03]: about herbariums, we talk more extensively
about it in the other podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: In honor of this podcast release,
we will be offering 10% off on the
[SPEAKER_03]: LeafWorks gender ID kits through the Kiss
Organics website for a limited time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about the benefits of these kits
and how it works in the podcast along with
[SPEAKER_03]: other topics around cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Eleanor, thanks for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wanted to start off, you know,
the last time we talked on the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: we talked a lot about CANDOR and
intellectual property and those things,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to follow up with you and
talk a little bit more about LeafWorks
[SPEAKER_03]: this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you, you know, why don't you
give us a brief overview of CANDOR for
[SPEAKER_03]: people who might not have heard that
podcast, and then we can really dive into
[SPEAKER_03]: LeafWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CANDOR is a cannabis herbarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first and only dedicated cannabis
herbarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is, is a repository of
physical pressed specimens that help to
[SPEAKER_00]: define the diversity and the cultivars and
varietals or strains that we see that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been held in the community and have been
lovingly not only bred and differentiated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but caretaked by many, many individuals
over decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CANDOR is really a spot where we
can just look at those plants and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where the community can define the
plants that they're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I highly suggest that people are
interested in learning about herbariums to
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to that podcast, because I learned
a ton of stuff there that I had no idea
[SPEAKER_03]: about from talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a separate project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a totally separate project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a project that grew out of
necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LeafWorks at its core, its fundamental
core, is a botanical identification
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the entire goal of LeafWorks is to
know what you're buying, selling and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really extends into the entire
herbal market, so the natural products
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, when you go into a health
food store or your local grocery store,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you buy either a tea or a tincture or
an herbal supplement, you have a list of
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients that are in that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is, as a third party
verifier, we look at those botanicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going into that product and verify if
it says there's acanacea purpurea in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We verify there is, in fact, acanacea
purpurea in there, and there aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants in there as filler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the natural food space,
it's required that you have a third party
[SPEAKER_00]: or a verification of the botanicals that
are going into your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just say you're selling ginkgo
and then sell celery instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important because in the
botanical trade, there's actually quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of fraud, which is, I guess,
an unfortunate truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this fraud is purposeful,
so it's very much like we're going to add
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants into this mix because the
adulterant plants are cheaper and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the fraud is purposeful,
but some of the fraud is inadvertent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have plants that are wildcrafted or
are harvested, and occasionally people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pick the wrong things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do is we work to identify
those botanical materials that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: into products to verify that they are,
in fact, the thing that we think they are
[SPEAKER_00]: or that the label is saying that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started to do work in cannabis,
we realized it's hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say it's bubblecush or you say it's
tangerine or you say it's cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you really know you're getting that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we started with
cannabis and really looking into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a botanical identification
company, if we're going to make a test to
[SPEAKER_00]: verify that you have ginkgo inside that
product, the first thing we do is go to an
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium and get herbarium samples that
have been vetted by a botanist that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert in the particular plant of
interest, in this case, ginkgo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use those herbarium specimens as
reference material, certified reference
[SPEAKER_00]: material, which is a very important thing
in not only science, but in the botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you have the certified
reference material, you can then use this
[SPEAKER_00]: as your gold standard to make,
in our case, a genetic assay that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify that plant based on a
reference material that we know is 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: the material we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we moved into cannabis and
we're really looking to do this value add
[SPEAKER_00]: for our cannabis customers and our
growers, there wasn't this vital resource
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could find certified reference
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there isn't something out there,
what do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to build it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how candor came into
existence was this lack of this very
[SPEAKER_00]: important resource that the community
really needs in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: empower themselves to define their
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really are just the vessel that
holds that information for the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to make sure I'm understanding you
correctly, like, for example, if someone
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to know if this plant was truly,
let's just stick with Tangy, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would have to, because there's no good
standard right now, I would think you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: have to collect a bunch of samples so that
people say, hey, I have a true pure Tangy
[SPEAKER_03]: genotype here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would kind of collect them
all and throw out any outliers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that would become the standard
for Tangy moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does this work in an industry where we
don't have an existing standard,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some plants, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other plants, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we're working, so we worked a
lot with Subcool before he passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a very easy way of defining
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was putting proper yields into the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were clones, super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a pressing of the
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use that as our reference
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of his crosses were seed crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same mom, same dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would take a sample of the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take samples of the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take a panel of the siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, this is the breath of diversity
that now is terrygasm or whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is that we were speaking about in
that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those types of definitions,
when you're working with a breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we also work with organizations like
Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organizations that are breeding and
putting proper yields into the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a much more straightforward,
cut and dry kind of definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're working with things that are
like Bubba Kush or things that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: community standards, things that have been
tried and around and in the community for
[SPEAKER_00]: a very long time, it's much more of what
you describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we take many samples from
organizations that have held the material
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take in all of the information we have,
where they got the plant, how long they've
[SPEAKER_00]: had the plant, the important
characteristics that define that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will take a wide swath of those
individuals and then compare them to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another and say, okay, out of these 80
samples or 10 samples, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: great our sampling is, let's say it's 10
samples, these nine are all holding
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to throw it out as an
outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's sort of like eating an
elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start where you're at and you get
as much information as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do this low-hanging fruit first,
the ones that are here where you still can
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with a breeder-specific person
that's giving that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other plants that are
sort of in community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the community help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have multiple people who, oh,
I know I gave this to this person in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s or I, you know, of really good
examples of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wade Laughter is the original breeder
of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows that he gave some of those plants
to be sold to Harborside during a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I run into an individual that's
like, oh, I bought this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in 92 from Harborside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have confidence that it's the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we compare them,
we see that, yes, they do genetically hold
[SPEAKER_00]: up and they physically hold up when we
compare the herbarium specimens to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another and the characteristics that are
driving the phenotype of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of investigation,
but it's really having the community lead
[SPEAKER_00]: us to where we need to get to make the
definition of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot like any other plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, can you say that,
like, let's just take the example with
[SPEAKER_03]: Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could say that a plant then has no
Harlequin actually in it, like if they
[SPEAKER_03]: claimed it was a Harlequin cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then conversely, if Harlequin was
derived and not into the plant genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: like some people are, let's say it was
derived from another cultivar or
[SPEAKER_03]: originally another varietal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to see that in the
Harlequin?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could say, oh, this was originally
pulled.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a little bit of, you know,
cushion it or a little bit of something
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you need a lot of information to
do that, some genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, that is part of what we do is,
you know, some individuals will come to us
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, I think I have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make sure we have enough of
the reference sample to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate, is it that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look and see if that is a
possible parental cross for a mystery
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can take a plant where someone
thinks they have what they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they think they know what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at it and say,
yes, it looks like it is in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it is a cross of these
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, we can't find any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence of this particular plant in its
pedigree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of an off question,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering how often do you just see
plants that have the same physical
[SPEAKER_03]: morphology or growth habits that and,
you know, someone might think it's a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a cookies, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you you do the genetic testing on
it and you're like, this really isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: related to cookies or, you know,
even though it may look similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis is an amazingly plastic
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plasticity is a kind of cool genetic
term where the environment really affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have the same phenotype looking
very different in different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, you can have a lot of
different genotypes converging on similar
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity and one of those those aspects
is the plasticity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a beautiful aspect and it's also a
challenging aspect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I've been saying, and maybe you'll
correct me here, that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: one, is probably at some of the greatest
diversity we've ever seen and may ever see
[SPEAKER_03]: with this plant just because of this
latest surge of, you know, legalization
[SPEAKER_03]: and breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I assume over time with capitalism and
commercialism, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems like we're at sort of a peak
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then along those lines, in terms of
diversity, are you feeling like we're
[SPEAKER_03]: still discovering new things regarding the
genetics of cannabis and learning more
[SPEAKER_03]: every day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you feel like you're starting to get
a handle for what what this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: contains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, answer the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is exceptionally diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sort of it is the best example of
the more you love something, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse you'll make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a couple of excellent
examples of humans in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can point to roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really make the diversity that we know
we have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expand it and we explode the types that
we the types of plants that we have around
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you can definitely see that in a
lot of our ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think roses is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dogs is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I can take a wolf and make all
of the different breeds that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just something like
anything that we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as humans are very good at caretaking
things that could never survive on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing that, we really do expand
that diversity in this immense and awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis is absolutely a
really good poster child for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of difference that we have not
only in smells and and statures and leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: shape is kind of a mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we're at a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that I feel like not move away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we'll ever move away for
growing, growing cannabis for its
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we will return to growing
cannabis for a lot of other purposes as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, especially as the hemp movement
gains traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that aspect of agriculture expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a lot more
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a lot more
cannabis and hemp is the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot more cannabis that is
specifically grown for fibers or to be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful in concrete type applications or
packaging applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going to see a lot of
expansion of diversity in those realms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to just the fact that every
time we look at the plant, we find more
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals that are doing more amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like THCV or CBG or CBN or
any of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we look and investigate,
the more we find it's really this treasure
[SPEAKER_00]: trove of amazing pharmacopial chemistry
that, you know, as humans we really
[SPEAKER_00]: resonate with with our own endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the diversity in cannabis is
only going to increase as we understand it
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really gets at the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're really just at the
very, very tip of the iceberg with
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the genetics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like to say quite
often is really comparing it to corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went to grad school,
the university that I was at, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in the building I was in,
I was in the genetics department.
[SPEAKER_00]: That department, I think, had seven labs
working on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you went over to the botany
department, you would probably add five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six additional labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you went over to the ag
department, you'd add five or six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you have 20, 30 labs at a
single institution that work on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you play that forward with
cannabis, the same thing is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because we really don't know very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition is really limited our
understanding of the science of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it takes a lot of work to
really drive down and understand genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: specific genes that are driving
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can get some broad strokes
pretty easily, but to really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the interplay of the entire genetic
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the genes and all of the other
components in the genetics that derive a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's years of research and lots
of time on task.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we're going to learn more
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next decade is going to be a very
cool time to be interested in genetics of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one thing that your your recent
comments just now made me think about,
[SPEAKER_03]: though, was a friend had sent me an
article on researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can post it on the podcast page and
we're done of scientists brewing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: using beer yeast, the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if you'd seen anything
on that, because they're actually able to
[SPEAKER_03]: turn certain compounds into THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you're not going to get the
full collection of diversity and compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: that you get in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know as scientists, a lot of scientists
are very derivative.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to break down these
individual compounds like THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing synergistic effects between
different cannabinoids and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_03]: how they all kind of play a role together
in terms of an experience for a user or a
[SPEAKER_03]: medical effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think this is going to change?
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who's a geneticist,
how do you take an article like this and
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you think that's going to affect
our industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's been affected in a lot
of different ways, but I really do look to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the precedent that's really been set
with herbalism and the natural products
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we can extract chemicals from
plants and use them in a very pointed way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my science brain, I completely
understand the need to approach things in
[SPEAKER_00]: that derivative kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just to simplify it enough
so that we can understand things about how
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals are either derived or how
they're specifically functioning within a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular system or on a particular cell
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think those derivative type of
experiments, that derivative or that very
[SPEAKER_00]: like, let's look at one chemical at a time
kind of thinking is exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that our understanding
and utility are not the same thing in my
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely have a deep appreciation
for that kind of work and the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we really look to something,
when we really look at herbal medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, we often find that just because
we can pinpoint a chemical that has 80 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the effect on whatever pathology
that we're looking at, it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is effective at curing the
pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll see that with cannabis,
especially with the ensemble or entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect with the multitude of chemicals
that are acting in concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it becomes so complex to really
understand how all of those things are
[SPEAKER_00]: really affecting your positive outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to be able to
replace the benefits of the herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine with a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's in our best
interest to do that, but you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking to someone who has a lot of faith
and confidence in herbal medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as a primary medicinal
modality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Western medicine is amazing at
what it does and there's no escaping the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for acute medicine at certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking at more holistic
medicine, especially food as medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs as medicine for health and longevity
and vitality, you're never going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a derivative product, as far as
I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'll be much like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're going to be able to find a
single molecule that has 90% of the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: to make something cure something or have
the positive medicinal effect that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that's going to be the
norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chemistry of cannabis is radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the plant medicine is still
going to be really important and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the industry can really lean
on that, especially as we understand more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more about the diversity of plants,
how different plants do better in
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start to think
epilations and the real understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: that interaction between the genotypes,
the different plants themselves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environments in which they're in and how
that really affects the quality of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to be the most
exciting information that we dig into in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to see too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my brain was just thinking while
you were talking about how I could see
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially people using THC compounds
derived from yeast to boost their THC
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers in their final product,
even if that product had kind of like what
[SPEAKER_03]: you were describing with the fillers and
the supplement industry at the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see people extracting terpenes
not only from cannabis, from other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you want some taste of
Glymaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are better from some citrus
than it is from, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be a market for that
and there will be players who that feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like the best solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to have different
quality metrics and that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting thing to watch,
especially as someone who sits here as
[SPEAKER_00]: like a third party lab, someone who is
really trying to communicate the essence
[SPEAKER_00]: of the material that's being sold,
so that not only can individuals who have
[SPEAKER_00]: special material articulate that to their
consumers, but so that consumers can start
[SPEAKER_00]: making choices about what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that'll be the real power is
how does the consumer move the ball
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like does the consumer want a high THC
product, even if it means we're spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast-driven THC on flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we'll be able to,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird move, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, you know, some people want to,
when you look at the alcohol industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not the best example or the
best parallel, but you know, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: want a table wine and you don't care that
it's three different kinds of grapes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it comes in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the situation calls for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other times, you know,
celebration and you want a very special
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going to have that
kind of product differentiation and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to add in my mind,
the value to the smaller family farm or
[SPEAKER_00]: the craft farm where they're really
growing a specific kind of plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific area and the quality is what's
going to drive, you know, the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, using your alcohol example,
I would look at it a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, hey, you know, we have a
market for wine, you know, because I want
[SPEAKER_03]: a glass of wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want ethanol, you know,
like I want something that has flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have something that has
enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not looking for just the effect of
being like, you know, inebriated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that to me is sort of like a cannabis
versus, you know, THC product derived from
[SPEAKER_03]: another source.
[SPEAKER_03]: But growing cannabis is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, commercially, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do see where something like this
could gain traction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it concerns me a little
bit, but I was just curious from like a
[SPEAKER_03]: geneticist perspective what you were
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there's this great little like
meme that's going around about you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we as consumers get over
the novelty of being allowed to interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis in a legal way, you know,
I think that novelty has got to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wear off so that instead of just having
this giddiness about being able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access, we can all of a sudden say,
oh, it's not, oh, I can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I really want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just want ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like something that is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like as we lose the novelty
of being able to access the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll have much more of a discerning
kind of palette driven consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it remains to be seen how
it will really play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that everyone just wants
to get inebriated.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that's also us growing
up as a consumer, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For learning about what's out there,
it's hard to know what you want if you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had a lot of experience,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say for folks who haven't
listened to my podcast, with Dr. Aidy Ray,
[SPEAKER_03]: where she talks literally just about this
topic and the idea of applying science to
[SPEAKER_03]: user experience and how THC is not the
driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start doing blind tests with
people in terms of what creates a better
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to follow up with her.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's working with, you know,
Jeremy Plumb and Stephanie Barnhart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a really cool thing that
they're doing in Portland around this
[SPEAKER_03]: concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I will have to follow up with
her and ask her the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would love to hear that follow up,
because it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teenager is like, yeah, I'll drink the
methanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, me, I'm not going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely am curious about how it
kind of I'm curious about how the
[SPEAKER_00]: education of the consumer goes,
because that's also a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of, you know, deepening
understanding of the plant and the value
[SPEAKER_00]: that differentiates different kinds of
growing methods and different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was something I wanted to ask you
a little while back here while we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as someone who loves growing tomatoes,
you know, I will choose varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: finish sooner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll tend to choose determinate
plants depending on how much height I
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look for things that have some level
of resistance, you know, like may not be
[SPEAKER_03]: as likely to get powdery mildew or rust
or, you know, whatever whatever crop I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look for those, you know, disease
resistance in the varietals that I choose
[SPEAKER_03]: for my vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we making any progress in that regard
with with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you starting to see markers associated
with some level of resistance to certain
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely are slowly making
strides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard thing with both susceptibility
and resistance is that very, very rarely
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a single gene situation where,
you know, you have this gene and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of the exception rather than
the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those types of plants are going to
be complicated to breed in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially because there's this really
interesting and dynamic interplay between
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the the molecules we really like
in cannabis that taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of those are also the
molecules the plants are using to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: against their own pests and predators,
whether they be insects or viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is this moment where
sometimes breeding things to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: more resistant will make them less
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we see that in a lot of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really just understanding the
plant and understanding how to decouple
[SPEAKER_00]: those things so you don't lose the
characteristics you like while moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a direction that makes it more
robust to pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're definitely making moves in that
direction, but I think it'll be a long and
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated process to really hone in on
the nuances of all of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the plants, especially when
you're looking at, you know, flavonoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes and all of those taste,
taste molecules, smell molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to yield and water,
you know, water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, there's so many
things when looking at a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of ways, we have,
as a community, cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: selected plants that are really great at
producing the chemistry we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not super great at living,
you know, because especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it inside, you can really baby that
plant in a way that is just not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going to have a
little bit of a challenge take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants that have been bred in that
extreme flavor direction, without any
[SPEAKER_00]: regard to, you know, can the plant stand
up on its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant might have glorious colas,
but if the stems aren't strong enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold them up, you know, it becomes more of
a challenge to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going to have to undo
some of those issues that we inadvertently
[SPEAKER_00]: created by growing in the styles that
we've been growing through prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so two points I want to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, resistance to is a sliding scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you may have a room with a bunch of
cultivars, and one may be less likely to
[SPEAKER_03]: get it or not display as many symptoms to,
let's say, botrytis or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not to say that if your spore
pressure gets high enough, it's not ever
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think we have to be
careful with the word resistance when
[SPEAKER_03]: people think of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing I want to mention
around it was, oh, just that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we talk about this level of diversity
in these plants, it makes it really hard
[SPEAKER_03]: to really know what we're seeing over
time, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, someone may say this plant
didn't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, you don't know how much
spore pressure you had in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and maybe your cover crop gets
it, but it's not the same powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: that affects cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's all these different
variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a long, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a long journey in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that point that you made is
right, is hitting the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this dance between, you know,
something may not get root rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you put it in standing water,
it's probably going to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's definitely that
interplay with the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be the number of pests or the
kind of pest, then yeah, some things are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be better equipped to deal with
it, but it is a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also, you know, you brought up the
point of how we were breeding during
[SPEAKER_03]: Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think at that point in time,
unfortunately, there were a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_03]: using systemic fungicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were able to grow these like
massive buds that literally would not get
[SPEAKER_03]: botrytis because they had, you know,
your people were using Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you just, you cannot grow these
things to the same size and scale without
[SPEAKER_03]: getting botrytis, you know, organically
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're kind of working
backwards from some of that stuff too,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some plants, moving them outside
is going to help them and other plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: just not going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a violent and dangerous
place for them and they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to utilize the beauty
of those plants and use them in breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that diversity is
going to help us understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the genetics that underpin the
characteristics that we love so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can track those characteristics down in
plants that are better suited for
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and situations that don't
need massive amounts of water or massive
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just not going to work in a
market where you're testing your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for human health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your outside outdoor comment brought up
another question for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hear a lot of talk around genetic
drift or genetic degradation with clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people say you have to move
take your clone and then grow it outdoors
[SPEAKER_03]: and breed it every four years or whatever
length of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you seeing with people who are
cloning the same plant over and over
[SPEAKER_03]: again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you seeing a lot of genetic drift over
time or mutation slowly on a given clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think anyone has enough
really good data to give a robust answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do see some genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll look at clones or clone
operations and, you know, things aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 99.8 or 99.9% identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is definitely somatic mutations
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the health and well-being of
clones, though, from at least what I have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in the experiences that we've had at
LeafWorks and the groups that we've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with, looking at this kind of question,
most of the time when we have plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: just aren't doing very well and the idea
of bringing them outside, it's generally
[SPEAKER_00]: pest and pathogen load that's doing the
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the drifting of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the genetics are similar enough,
you know, 99.9% similar, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other external circumstances that are
driving like the decline in the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: not so much just the fact that it's a
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's certain things that are
systemic in terms of diseases that could
[SPEAKER_03]: cause a different, you know, poorer
expression of that plant over time if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're cloning it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could definitely see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like anything, if you're cloning
and you have a plant that's 30 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's had 30 years to acquire
bugs along the way, you know, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: be viruses or, you know, just pressure
from other predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: A newly germinated seed is like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't had as many negative
interactions to affect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does extreme stress affect genetic
expression over time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's say you had a plant that had a
huge amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a big mite problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that potentially cause greater
genetic drift or other issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no evidence that it creates
greater genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does do is it can change gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that stresses a plant out
absolutely affects gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be positive or it can be
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certain medicinal plants that you
actually want to whack back or cut all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before you're going to harvest the
medicinal part of the plant because the
[SPEAKER_00]: emulation of predators like eating the
leaves will boost the production of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the phytochemistry that you're
actually interested in as a person using
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant for a medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an odd one where predation
actually increases the chemistry that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens in certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we'll see that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, heat stress is going to make
some herm and do all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we definitely see changes in the
gene expression based on stressors for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not necessarily going to carry
on to the next generation or even
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily into a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's say you had a vegetative plant
prior, like before cloning it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that just went through a variety of
stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you had a plant that just went
through a variety of stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you forgot to water it, maybe it got
too hot, maybe didn't get enough light,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you nurse it back to health at that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know as a human, like my
cortisol levels have probably gone through
[SPEAKER_03]: the roof and then come back down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But am I passing that on to my children at
some point when I have to have a have a
[SPEAKER_03]: child or like in this case, if you're
cloning a plant, is that getting passed on
[SPEAKER_03]: or is that just go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's going to go way more easily
if you go through a seed round,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the genetics are transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetics, so things that change
expression, so like change methylation
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns and how things are regulated,
that is much more damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetics are not heritable in the same
way that, you know, like the DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: heritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cloning, though, you're not
actually going through a gamete,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not actually going through sexual
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cloning, you can actually carry
those epigenetic changes on for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of those changes are permanent
and you can't undo them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that stress really can affect the
plant more long term as a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like, you know,
like there's these great twin studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done as humans where, you know,
one twin will smoke or one twin will run
[SPEAKER_00]: marathons all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, and it changes the
epigenetic context of their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they have differential
expression of different genes and thus
[SPEAKER_00]: have differential health as a result of
their actions in, you know, positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm positive as we dig in and look
more closely at these things, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can look at them with,
you know, we have clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the best thing for a
geneticist to be able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: anything is to be able to look at clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like we're going to we're
going to understand more and more about
[SPEAKER_00]: this as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, we can expect that epigenetics
will remain in a clone a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetic changes will remain in a clone
a lot longer than plants that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: through sexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, before I forget, though, I wanted to
cover sort of the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about this in the last podcast,
but, you know, people are sending you
[SPEAKER_03]: plant samples, you know, leaf tissue,
enough for you to be able to do these
[SPEAKER_03]: these types of genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, you know, as a grower, what are the
risks associated with that in regard to
[SPEAKER_03]: protecting and preserving intellectual
property or that plant themselves that
[SPEAKER_03]: they feel that they have some ownership
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, leaf work is very, very direct about
their genetic, our genetic data policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any plants that we take in to do a
test, whether it be a gender ID test where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're helping you sex your plants early or
other tests looking at different either
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural ID tests or sort of we do a
double check just to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a plant you think you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just run the test and that's all we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a very robust genetic data
program where we we work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeders and growers and look at
the diversity of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do different things to understand
the genetics that underpin characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: that those growers are really interested
in, whether it be flowering time or
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have an active research side of
the company, but those research projects
[SPEAKER_00]: are separate from you're going to send me
your plants to do gender ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants don't cross over at all in
our in our in our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very, you know, very strict
if you send us something to do a test on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the only thing we do with that
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we have such a vested interest
in really promoting the diversity that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists in the cannabis community and
helping those individuals that have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to not only develop all of these
different plants, but steward them and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them safe and protected over the over
the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really work very, very closely and very
hard with organizations that have special
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to define those plants so that they
can gain that intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's something that is
confusing for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what what is the intellectual
property that I own as a grower or a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and really, any plant that's been in
the community for more than a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, for the most part is a really
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we were talking about any
other plants, everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, you shouldn't own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then people get weird when they start
talking about cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just like different attitude
about these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to really own a plant,
you have to have done a lot, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have done work to breed something special
and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to define that is to
define it in the way that we define all
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants, which is to make herbarium
pressing and write a botanical description
[SPEAKER_00]: that enumerates why that particular plant
cultivar varietal is special and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the characteristics that make
that plant special and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we take in plants to do
cultivar registration, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take those plants, we work with candor
to make herbarium pressing, we do genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that are then linked to those herbarium
pressing so that there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: tangible to link those genetics to,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics in a vacuum mean nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if I go to my local
dispensary and buy a pre-roll and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence it, even if I'm the first one to
sequence that plant, it does not mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: own anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of like going to the store
and deciding I'm going to buy a gala apple
[SPEAKER_00]: and sequence it and then tell everyone
that I own gala apples because I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that doesn't really make much
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have this idea that that's how you
gain ownership of plants in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just it's a false it's a false
promise that I think a lot of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations are giving to people to
sequence data really means nothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially because just like anything,
I mean, we look at the sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between chimps and humans and
we're almost the same at the sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is also true with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really understand what is the
phenotype that makes this plant different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to describe that in order to
gain any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important thing in gaining IP
protection, if you have something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: eligible, is to do botanical description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics are kind of the icing on the
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not you don't need you need the
cake to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the icing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the genetics really just add value.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the driver of any kind of IP
application that you would do for a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so let me try and yeah, let me try and
summarize my understanding of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And please correct me anywhere in here if
I screw up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just say I'm a grower and I have
a very special plant that I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: unique and I want to preserve it and have
some level of ownership over it because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount of time and energy I put into
breeding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would at this point need to reach out
to a lab and it has to be a lab that I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel comfortable with and trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd want to read their genetic data policy
so I know exactly what they're giving me
[SPEAKER_03]: and what I'm giving them in regards to
information and plant material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in order for that DNA sequencing
to have any value, it has to be tied to an
[SPEAKER_03]: herbarium based on how we currently value
or view ownership of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is sort of unique to plants,
as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at that point, having those two
things tied together and having this
[SPEAKER_03]: information from a lab would allow me to
have some sort of legal framework around
[SPEAKER_03]: which to show that that I own this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, and this plant also has to have
not been out in the world for more than a
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Publicly, is that kind of cover it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants, you know, plant IP is not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a plant patent in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to specifically show how you've
altered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's generally for clonal type
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have seeds and things,
you can get plant varietal protections,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, so there's different
nuances and a lawyer is going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to really articulate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most fundamental aspect is really
the plant is a botanical description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the same thing like we went off
into some uncharted territory and found a
[SPEAKER_00]: new orchid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first thing we're going to do
when we find that new orchid or develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: new plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just breed a new cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you find this new plant or breed
this new plant, the first thing you do is
[SPEAKER_00]: do that botanical description to describe
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always linked to a physical sample,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a tangible thing to
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the genetics really are just the
icing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about the genetic work
that we do with breeders is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders want to then license their plants
to different farms and say go through this
[SPEAKER_00]: process of writing these beautiful
licensing agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay a lawyer a lot of money and then
they don't have any way to enforce that
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the genetics that we do are really
just a tool that then that breeders can
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize to audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can audit their grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing the right plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you giving these plants to someone you
shouldn't be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can sample those plants and say,
oh, wait, these are my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really enforce your contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valuable tool, but it doesn't give
you anything just because you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anyone can sequence anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no rules about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around that note, if someone sends you
plant material, we were talking a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit before the podcast about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned this wasn't like a Jurassic
Park situation where you can completely
[SPEAKER_03]: recreate this plant and then start growing
and selling this plant yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequencing doesn't give you that kind
of power.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it give you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sequencing gives you a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is really that like that
toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a bunch of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics gives you tools to track
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this licensing example, to be able
to track plants through a system or
[SPEAKER_00]: through different growers, it also gives
you the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that this plant smells like
blueberries, right, you can then utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and compare some like compare 10
plants that smell like blueberries to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that don't smell like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can whittle down between that
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those things that are driving the
smell that you're interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you have those tools,
then you can look in and you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: your own breeding stock, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't just recreate breeding
stock with with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you then you can use those genetic
tools to screen your breeding stock to
[SPEAKER_00]: find things that are most likely to smell
like blueberries, if that's what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just a toolkit that can
help facilitate and streamline breeding so
[SPEAKER_00]: that instead of having to grow a thousand
plants and, you know, do the chemistry for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them, you can say, oh, out of these
thousand plants, these hundred are most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to smell like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow them and focus on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, breeding is iterative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to start still have to do
more work on those plants to get where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what those genetics do is they give
you a toolkit to make it easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the big issue that people had with that
company in Oregon that was collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: people's plants and genetic information to
create this collection was that as a
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder, if I'm giving you a plant that I
know is special and it's going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: these specific genetic markers that relate
to its specialness, whether that's
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance or THC levels or, you know,
some synergistic effect of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids, you know, as some as a lab
that's collecting all this information,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can use the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're getting a larger and
larger data set over time to where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: start saying, you know, all of these
plants that people are saying are special
[SPEAKER_03]: for this reason all have these same
genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to work with a breeder now and
say, hey, we're going to breed until we
[SPEAKER_03]: get these same genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have an advantage over other
growers because we can use this as an
[SPEAKER_03]: extra tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that does that kind of summarize what
what the the anger and frustration was
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the anger and yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the anger and frustration
really came from being duplicitous about
[SPEAKER_00]: the intent and selling a product that was
sold at or under cost, not because you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to sell a product, but because you
wanted to gain genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's different when you're working
with a breeder and you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we're going to do this project
together and we're going to push your
[SPEAKER_00]: material forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is this is how we're working in
synergy with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very different model than I'm
going to take all this information from
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that may or may not want to
help that cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to I'm going to shift my I'm
going to shift my direction as an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, I'm going to tell you that
I'm doing and I'm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asking genetic diversity for the greater
good, and then you're going to shift your
[SPEAKER_00]: business model into I'm going to be a
producer of propagules and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: compete with my customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's all about tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about what you're doing and it's
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're a breeding
organization, that's fine, but present
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself as a breeding organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the issue is like
nobody likes to feel like they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: duped and nobody likes to feel like
they're dealing with someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicitous in their intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that's really where the
anger came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, no, a lot of people would still
work with you if you say this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be like straightforward
about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this particular organization,
I think the anger really came from saying
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain set of things in community
settings and then saying a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: set of goals when it was come in time to
talking to their board or their investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're whatever you say to
whatever you're saying to anybody about
[SPEAKER_00]: the trajectory of an organization,
it should be the same no matter what room
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the investor room or if
you're in your client room or if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: a community room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the issue is that it's
just not being straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really likes that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't interview with Reggie
Gaudino when he was with the CSO at Steep
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill Labs, and he was very clear about the
fact that they are collecting this data
[SPEAKER_03]: and what their potential plans were for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he also said, you know, they could get
bought out by Dow at some point,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that data might be used for something
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something you need to be aware
of and a risk associated with who you
[SPEAKER_03]: choose to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, as a grower or breeder,
you're going to have to pick a lab at some
[SPEAKER_03]: point if you want to have this genetic
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit of a catch 22.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, this happened to me in my
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my father did a lot of work in the
infancy infancy around compost tea in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of paying a lab to do a lot of
testing around, you know, how does water
[SPEAKER_03]: quality affect what microbes are grown out
in, you know, in our brewer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how does changing these designs affect
the microbial diversity or the food
[SPEAKER_03]: sources?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is E.
[SPEAKER_03]: coli able to grow in this in this brewer
under these conditions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So any, you know, spent, oh, tens of
thousands of dollars on all this testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, a few years later,
this particular lab started selling
[SPEAKER_03]: compost tea brewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was very, very frustrated because
all of us had been using this lab to do
[SPEAKER_03]: testing as sort of an independent
resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we were competing directly with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a huge advantage of having
all of our tests and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely understand the situation
that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important, like when
you're looking for a genetic testing
[SPEAKER_00]: company, what so one of the things I'm so
proud of about leaf works is our core
[SPEAKER_00]: mission is to help individuals define the
plants that are in community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's doing cultivar registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more of those cultivar
registrations we can do where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: vouchers, and we have histories,
and we have breeding pedigrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it immortalizes those
plants in the community such that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say that this is a unique plant
that makes CBD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all plants that make this chemical I
now own with this utility patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the utility patents that
are being put out by some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic companies that everyone is working
with are so super overreaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were just look at the resource
of the herbarium, or would look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar registration that leaf works is
doing, you would see, oh, that patent is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in violation of, you know,
all is not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's part of the problem is
we don't have resources for patent lawyers
[SPEAKER_00]: who are, you know, looking over these
applications to say that it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: overreaching patent, like there's not the
information is, you know, you tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the only plant that makes this
this particular ratio of chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they grant you that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have someone over here that has
a plant that has a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary background is a different
plant that makes the same pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that would prove that that was that
particular especially the utility patents
[SPEAKER_00]: should be, you know, vetoed should be
thrown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have we have a dearth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the things that I'm
so proud of leaf work for doing is the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that we do to define genetics helps
to preserve and empower those people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been holding those plants to be able
to continue to use and breed with those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't have someone come in and say,
Oh, I own this plant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have proof that well,
you can't own it because this has been in
[SPEAKER_00]: community or this has been bred,
or this is a different version of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, whatever the story is,
I was going to give the power to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the problem,
because we don't know what plants are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you can have people say this is
unique and special, and I own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to, you know, there's these
utility patents, it's like, between two
[SPEAKER_00]: and 5% THC and between 12 and 16% CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has that ratio, I own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's more than one
evolutionary background that can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: that chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, but it's hard for her people
who are assigning, you know, I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent lawyer, right, like that
doesn't know exactly how to judge these
[SPEAKER_00]: patent applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we're gonna have a lot of
things thrown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But documenting what we have is one of the
most important ways to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to our material long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what you're saying is,
it's not so much about owning something,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's about keeping community access to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So other people are going to be collecting
information and potentially trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: claim ownership over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by having, you know, candor and leaf
works doing this work, potentially it
[SPEAKER_03]: allows the community to continue access to
these plants without paying patents,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not about just having a special
plant, but it's about protecting our
[SPEAKER_03]: rights to all of this diversity and all
these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I never looked at it quite that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's both sides, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the tomato community has a
really good framework for this where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can breed tomatoes, but we have a really
good understanding of what tomatoes are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and which ones have patent
protection and which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you breed something new,
you also have a way to articulate that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's new, like the rose society is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I if I breed a new rose,
they have a registration of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thousands of rose cultivars that are
out there and they can say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it its own name and its own,
you know, story around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have this this reference in
order to be able to articulate that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something new and novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we run out of time,
you know, I wanted one of the questions I
[SPEAKER_03]: had, I want to talk to you about was the
advantages of gender testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you offer gender testing, you list in
your genetic data policy that you destroy
[SPEAKER_03]: the samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not associated with the the other
aspects of your company around the
[SPEAKER_03]: research program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you talk a little bit about why
someone might want to do gender testing in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of an ROI or the advantages around
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are growing from seed there's a
lot of different reasons why you'd want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do gender testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and foremost is, of course,
you can know the sex of that plant seven
[SPEAKER_00]: to ten days after germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you can take a little tiny
piece of that plant or a little piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cotyledon and not kill the plant,
you can know what the sex is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great because depending on how
you're growing and your growing style,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you generally save when we do our
return on investment analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you save between 20 and 30% on your on
your grow based on not having to spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: time the way on the labor, the material of
repotting and transplanting, taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants until they show until they
show their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other really great advantage is if you
know which plants are girls, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping only your girls, then you can get
them into their final resting spot earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: like their final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't have this issue where
you're like waiting for them to show and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just have healthier plants,
because they're getting into their spot
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, their roots are going to be
healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And healthy roots, of course, as we all
know, makes healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's really nice is you,
you know, especially with organizations
[SPEAKER_00]: that have square footage requirements,
you really make sure you're using your
[SPEAKER_00]: space in the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not using some of your space to
grow boys that then you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill in with female plants after the
fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really maximizing the number of
plants that you can get into your space
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be productive for you in your in
your production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and plant count numbers for people
dealing with that, too, on the flip side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of growers that say the
funniest things like I have one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know this wonderful
human, but he said the funniest thing he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I use you because I'm too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in my eyes aren't good anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can put that on the
website, but it was another reason why why
[SPEAKER_01]: someone is using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to look at this is such a
waste of time to have to walk around and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at those plants when my eyes can't
always see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's all kinds of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do see people all the time online
asking, you know, is this a male,
[SPEAKER_03]: is this a female?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll see a variety of answers a
lot of times underneath in the comments
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, at that point, you've
already put in, you know, two,
[SPEAKER_03]: three weeks into this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the time savings is the big
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we recently ordered some cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to be offering them through
Kiss Organics as another service to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to purchase these gender ID kits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited to work with you
guys on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, so the price just for people
who are interested and just listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts and might want to know more
ranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like from ten to fifteen dollars
a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a card.
[SPEAKER_03]: The minimum would be four plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're looking at sixty dollars to try
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about what that process is
for someone who receives a kit in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have variable pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it at scale, we,
of course, want to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps us out to be able to do it in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we give you a discount on bulk
orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're receiving your kit,
what you get is a collection card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that collection card, you're going
to take a little tiny piece of that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to press and squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to actually use the back of a
Sharpie marker to rub back and forth over
[SPEAKER_00]: that card to really press that plant
material onto the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that juice is really going to soak
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special paper that DNA sticks to
and it breaks down proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just send that card back to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we just take a whole
bunch of the card and just do a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use multiple markers, which is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's unique about
our sexing is that we have five markers
[SPEAKER_00]: across the Y chromosome that we look for
instead of just using one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most all of our competitors are just using
a single marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because not all males
have all of the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of diversity in cannabis,
as we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really wanted to make sure that
we offered the most robust test and we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't missing any males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it was really important for
us to have multiple markers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out across that Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never missed anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take in that card, we take a
little piece of that paper, we do that
[SPEAKER_00]: assay, and then we let you know via email
which plants with which tags are male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started looking into this and
wanting to offer a gender ID kit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you go online and you see other kits that
are less expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think you were the one actually
that had to explain to me that those kits,
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually have to have a lab or other
tools in order to really process them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy, I guess there's one that's
like $5 sample, but you have to have a PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and you have to do the work
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to do all of the lab
work, which of course requires a 15 to
[SPEAKER_00]: $40,000 machine and a person that knows
how to do PCR and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pipetters to be able to do the PCR,
which are several hundred dollars each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so unless you're really equipped to
put a whole lab on your farm, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really the cheap solution that you think
it is because you do need all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure in order to be able to do
the test itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was just something.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you do a quick Google search,
it's not very clear the differences there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to mention that for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate that because it's
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, but we can do this for five
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, but do you have a PCR
machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like how many of those do you have to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were like, oh, I'll buy a PCR
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you have to do 500,000 of
these to break even now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it depends on, you know,
if your farm that's doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that everyone is at the
scale where it breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks the.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it breaks even very easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for people that want just the gender
ID, this is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what is the process for someone who
wants to be more involved with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the cultivar registration side
of things?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that process look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a breeder, you have a special
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a cultivar registration on your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hold like we have also
individuals that hold these immense
[SPEAKER_00]: collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have had these plants for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also do cultivar registrations for
them where we take in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do the botanical description and we
then take it and look at our other
[SPEAKER_00]: reference material to make sure that if
they say it's plant A, it is in fact plant
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been really good for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a breeder, it makes sense that
you're defining your material and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all those ducks in a row to really
have the documents documentation you need
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a collector, it's also a really
good way to understand the plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, especially if you're someone who
grows plants in multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cultivar registrations in that
process can really help you understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: like let's say three farms, which farm is
the best to grow what plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of additional
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of plays in and dovetails
into a lot of the work that is coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: the the regulatory frameworks that are
happening around not only California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are starting to percolate in other
states as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that cultivar registration is
really a great way of documenting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you have and being able to leverage
that information to the best use for your
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking at this page right now
and it's pretty interesting the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: information you get about a particular
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, what would I send you in order for
you to do this service?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two, in regards to this service,
I see you don't have any pricing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to give a range of sort of
what something like this might cost or is
[SPEAKER_03]: that not something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I definitely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're registering a single plant,
it's $5,500 to do a single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing multiple plants,
that price goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We visit the farm or we send you a kit
such that you can do the herbarium portion
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and making the pressings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our staff botanist take
that information and write that botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take in pedigree history and we do all
of those those aspects of the registration
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically present to you and we do the
genetics, link those together and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: present to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a little magazine that
pulls all that information together and is
[SPEAKER_00]: this little document that you have in
order to share about the plant itself with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, customers, other people who
maybe want to grow your plant if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also gives you that tool set
with the genetics that are linked so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have any additional utility,
you can utilize those tools to track
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, articulate what's interesting
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it if you are going the IP
route with your lawyer as part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: docket.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those components can then be
utilized for those purposes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I highly suggest that people go on
to the leafworks website and look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar registration page just because
it's a really interesting the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, it's almost like a little
magazine about the about that particular
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, your example is a pistachio
chai.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of interesting to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if you don't ever plan on
registering a plant, it's just kind of an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing is where this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's say we've we registered that
chai and now I'm an extract maker and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: buying pistachio chai flower from a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now take my flower and send it into
leafworks and verify that I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I have that I can put a little
leafwork certified feel on my product,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be a vape pen or some rosin or
any other kind of product that then I can
[SPEAKER_00]: convey to my customers exactly what's in
that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really moving toward bringing
cannabis into the fold and treating it
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we do the other plants such that
especially if I'm a product maker that one
[SPEAKER_00]: step away from the farm, it's a way that I
can have assurance that I'm getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower I think I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have some assurance through a third
party that, you know, not only is it the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I think it is, but it's not,
you know, cut with trim from something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can also convey that to my
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as we get just like we were
talking about earlier, as we get more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more refined in our own consumer desires,
being able to really articulate what plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the product and having the customer
have confidence that they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting what they want, it's going to be
beneficial for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I've made a pre-roll
with a certain plant, potashio chai,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have made this beautiful
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know I like potashio chai and I see
these two products and they both are
[SPEAKER_00]: leafwork certified, it is that plant in
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more likely to buy your product
because I know I'm going to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does is it gives this
confidence and it's confidence that's then
[SPEAKER_00]: shared between brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it increases the brand equity
because you know that that label means
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So along those lines, I assume it's a lot
less expensive to do a check on a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: than it is to do this whole registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does something like that cost if you
wanted to just, you know, check to see if
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics match what you thought they
did of something you'd already done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just doing a double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant double check is $250 for a
single double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, if you're doing a,
excuse me, if you're doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: double checks, we sell those in bulk as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I did go down this,
let's say as a grower, you want to do this
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar registration, is there any risk
of, you know, potentially losing that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to the lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, could you take what you are
collecting and somehow grow out this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: through tissue culture or some other
methodology?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we, yeah, we just, the only access we
ever have to the plant is through the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbarium and it's dried plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really do anything with that
other than reference it long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't tissue culture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, what it is, is it's a,
it's a immutable reference that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: point to, to make sure no one else is
stealing your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last question for you,
is there any way to view some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: registrations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to a way to know that like,
if what I'm trying to create as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a certified reference material has
already been created or if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: something similar?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can always contact Leafworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we've been talking about how to
present that in a more user-friendly way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires a lot of web
[SPEAKER_00]: design alteration as maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done quite a bit of work with the
Humboldt seed company and their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly we're working with them on doing
seminar seed certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who really want to know that
they're buying seminar seeds, that
[SPEAKER_00]: certification is important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, that's probably the first thing
we're going to put up as a list,
[SPEAKER_00]: a referenceable list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see which cultivars from which
organizations have been certified with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Femini seed cert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we do that, we'll,
we'll grow into adding those cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: registrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's this weird interaction
between privacy for our customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also getting the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're, we're figuring that out
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're hoping to somehow in the
future, make some of this information more
[SPEAKER_03]: available to the canvas community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely our goal, especially as we
start to get, you know, plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really utilized by a lot of different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know a lot of the biovortex
seeds are grown by a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and all kinds of different products
are made out of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to reference the cultivar
registration of like, black dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, and then see, oh,
you know, mood mate is growing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: making beautiful pre-rolls and,
you know, Bryson, Bryson family farm is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is making well extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is absolutely the shorter
long-term goal for that, that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope people, you know, found a lot of
this information useful and I really look
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to working with you in regards to
offering these gender ID kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to get it out to more people
and help them streamline their process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Dr. Eleanor Kuntz, co-founder of
LeafWorks and Candor.
