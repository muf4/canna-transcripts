[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guest this week is Jim Barrett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim has a bachelor's of science from the
Auburn University in Agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: Services, a master's of science from
Auburn University with an emphasis on
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology of vegetable crops and a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: from Michigan State University with an
emphasis on physiology of horticulture
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a professor at the University of
Florida from 1978 to 2016 with a focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: crop production in controlled
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: A major component of his work was
evaluating plant growth hormones,
[SPEAKER_02]: also known as PGRs, and developing new
application strategies for greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: After retiring from the university,
he went on to run Barrett Horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: Consulting for four years with a focus on
crop production and facility planning for
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida medical cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has since retired again and requested
that folks not attempt to contact him,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he kindly agreed to come on the
podcast to share some of his experience
[SPEAKER_02]: around PGRs and was originally recommended
to me by Suzanne Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was grateful to catch up with him on the
phone and learn more about plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones and regulators and how they may
impact crops like cannabis, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: what risks may be associated with their
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jim, well, thanks for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, can we start off by giving
listeners a little bit of your background
[SPEAKER_02]: in the horticultural world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a retired faculty member from
the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent about 40 years there
specializing in crops that are grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either vegetables or a lot of the flower
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main things that I was
doing there was looking at plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators that are real commonly used in
greenhouse crops and looking at evaluating
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, evaluating formulations,
application methods and procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my work there was directed at
trying to reduce the amount of actual
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical that is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that the chemical that was being
used by the commercial growers would be
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'd be less of it being used,
less getting into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last few years since I retired from
University of Florida, I got involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some consulting in the cannabis
market in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with some of the growers there
in developing their culture for that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, as well as designing
facilities and that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm a retired grandfather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to emphasize you are now
fully retired and you're doing this out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your own generosity of your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're no longer looking for consulting
work and there won't be any contact
[SPEAKER_02]: information for you in the podcast section
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to throw that out there for
listeners as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I want you to obviously
enjoy your time as a grandfather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's dive in talking about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd want to start talking a little bit
about some of the definitions and labeling
[SPEAKER_02]: around, you know, plant growth hormones
and plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like we're going to use
those terms sort of synonymously in this
[SPEAKER_02]: in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term plant growth regulator or plant
growth regulators is as a pretty broad
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's often
associated with plant growth regulators is
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they are a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the term pesticide for the federal
government, the EPA, pesticide is a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legal term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant growth regulators from
EPA standpoint, they are classified as
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, in the EPA, you have
insecticides, fungicides, herbicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant growth regulators that fall
under what they describe as pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, we often think of
pesticides as something you're trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: a chemical you're trying to kill
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant growth regulators are not
trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to, you're doing something
to regulate the growth and the evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of a crop that you're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that standpoint, as a user,
you have to treat them differently and
[SPEAKER_00]: think about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're considerably, plant growth
regulators are considerably more difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage as a grower than insecticides
and fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that whether or not a plant growth
regulator is a pesticide becomes a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, especially in the cannabis market,
it is a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing tomatoes or geraniums or
poinsettias or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products that you use there,
whether it's an insecticide or a growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator, comes with a federal label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't use it unless it has an
EPA approved label describing how it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, in the cannabis market,
there's not any federal regulations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are no real pesticides with
federal labels for the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's starting to evolve a little bit
more with health just because of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But primarily for recreational or
medicinal cannabis, it's regulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: individual states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies so much from one state to
another in what the state approves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes a real legal issue as to
whether or not a PGR can be used from a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal standpoint in any given state or any
given market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the legal plant growth
regulator situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legally classified as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the PGRs, they're widely varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PGRs in general are either a
naturally occurring or a synthetic plant
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone or a chemical that regulates one
of the natural plant hormones or the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reason there's some
confusion about whether it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: called hormones or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've sort of just evolved just using
term plant growth regulators for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hormones like gibberellin,
natural hormone in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that gibberellin does in
the plant is causes stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes the plants to get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, in cannabis, we must have a lot
of gibberellin in that plant because they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a group of chemicals that are
synthetic that interfere with the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of gibberellin in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are gibberellin synthesis
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that group of chemicals, if you put
those on a plant, it will make the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces the amount of gibberellin in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant is shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a product like paclobutazole is in that
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have other hormones like auxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auxin, IA is the natural auxin,
helps cuttings form roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty common for us to use
synthetic auxins, IBA or NAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are products or chemicals that are
in our product like dip and grow to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote rooting, bone cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinin is another type of natural plant
hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in promoting lateral blood
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also involved in leaf dieback,
turning yellow, senescence of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cytokinin materials,
the synthetic cytokinins or the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokinins might be found in something
like seaweed extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will promote lateral blood growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in some of the synthetic materials like
a material that's called 6BA, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic cytokinin, it reduces leaf
yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant treated with that, the leaves
stay longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay green longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apsizic acid is a plant hormone that is
involved in causing leaves to drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps plants go dormant in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so apsizic acid is something that
reduces growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, there are very few apsizic
acids that are used in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, there has started being used
pretty widely of apsizic acid for use on
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes and some other crops now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the grapes turn red or ripen
uniformly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that makes the harvest easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an example of how many of
these plant growth regulators are used on
[SPEAKER_00]: food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene is a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural plant hormone used by the
plant normally in response to some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is synthetic products,
ethyphon is the name of one, that when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are treated with ethyphon,
it produces the ethylene gas inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant responds like it is
responding to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing about ethylene
is just lots and lots of uses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene can be used to cause flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, pineapples, almost all
the pineapples we consume in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant was treated with ethylene in the
field to get it to the set fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all our tomatoes and bananas are
treated with ethylene after they were
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested to get them to ripen uniformly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another set of synthetic
materials that block the action of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the formation or the action of
ethylene in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these are used in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not legally, but we can talk
about this a little bit more later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ethylene becomes an important chemical
to talk about very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasmonic acid is one that's being
researched quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the folks that are looking at
plant hormones across the board in all
[SPEAKER_00]: types of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term plant growth regulator covers
a wide base of chemistry or actual
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals and also a wide base of what
we're trying to do in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So took a little time answering that
question, but it's a pretty complex issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's college courses just on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize it's quite broad and there's a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're obviously not going to be able
to get into all of it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to touch on some of the
highlights from our conversations off air
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things I'd like to start
with, because when I think of plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators in cannabis, I immediately go
to Pakla Butruzal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's the one that everyone
knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one that was most commonly used.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, you know, you can tell if a if
a plant has been treated with Pakla
[SPEAKER_02]: Butruzal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about it just as
a general perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's talk about how,
you know, in terms of how it affects a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, just strictly from, you know,
morphology, a morphology aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's talk a little bit about
what's going on possibly inside inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Pakla Butruzal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a product that I started working
with about 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a long history with Pakla
Butruzal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Pakla Butruzal is a synthetic
chemical that blocks the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: gibberellin in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it it is an inhibitor of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, Pakla Butruzal,
there are several others in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniconazole is the molecular structure is
very similar to Pakla Butruzal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Uniconazole is more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diminizide is in the same group of
chemicals that block GA synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramiquat, chloride, or some people
know it as cyclosal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyclosal is one of the or chloramiquat is
one of the more widely used chemicals in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture is used many, many parts of
the world on wheat and grain crops to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent them from lodging to keep them
standing up stronger in the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also being used on turf grasses
and golf courses and stuff quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pakla Butruzal is the one that is very
often used and because it is readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available in agricultural markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some cannabis growers have have
tried it and have used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's blocking gibberellin,
it causes the inner nodes to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: compact, shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very, very strong relationship
with the dose amount that is put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's if you take the example of a
something like a cannabis plant that has
[SPEAKER_00]: long inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would normally be getting inner
nodes that are as the plant is growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: either vegetative or in flowering,
if the inner node naturally would be let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say five inches long, you could put on a
Pakla Butruzal amount that might reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: that to three to four inches or you can
put on enough that you reduce it to a half
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch or an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just a matter of what the
grower is trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get those kinds of effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakla Butruzal is very, very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's important to think
about from the cannabis market is that
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakla Butruzal is very long lasting in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down in the plant, degrades very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I think that is a
significant issue is that more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, particularly if you're in a
medical market now, all of your product
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be tested before it goes to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pakla Butruzal absolutely will show up
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know plants that are still
showing the growth effects of Pakla
[SPEAKER_00]: Butruzal five to six years after they've
been treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is an issue to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a very serious issue for
many of us in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be clear, it's not it's not legal
to use Pakla Butruzal on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no legal application for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being an organic grower had a
lot of negative associations with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I haven't really researched it too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I think is
interesting that you mentioned in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: how long it stays in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's essentially what you're saying is
it's systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I have issues cloning a plant that
had been treated with Pakla Butruzal for,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, potentially multiple generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the concentration, depends on
the rate that was put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on a mother plant, for example,
if you put on a little bit too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put on just a little bit of Pakla
Butruzal, maybe you can reduce the length
[SPEAKER_00]: of your cuttings by 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just stack those nodes right on
top of each other and you won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough stem there to take a cutting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you put on too much on a mother
plant, you throw the plant away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you end up doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the main reason people are
using it is to increase the weight and
[SPEAKER_02]: density of their buds or flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's typically what I hear about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is not an area that I am
terribly knowledgeable on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you mentioned,
because I was worried about safety from a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical perspective for people who may be
immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it carcinogenic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sorts of questions around its use in
terms of danger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your concern from talking to you sounded
like a more the highest level risk is with
[SPEAKER_02]: the applicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: With these in general, I think,
PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pesticides in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, many of our pesticide
regulations that we see are designed and
[SPEAKER_00]: we talk about the end user, the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're working with something
that's toxic, the person that has the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest exposure is the person who's
applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's something that's toxic,
that is the person that has the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: potential problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a number of examples of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I started to use a couple of
specific name examples that I won't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're sort of in the courts
right now and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the cannabis market, this spills
over to the silver issue in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market where silver products are being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, some of the products
that are being recommended for use twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: day until flowering, that person who's
applying that silver has a potential lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of exposure to a metal that's not very
safe for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that applies to all of our chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to Paclobutazole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any Paclobutazole
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any of these synthetic
gibberellin inhibitors that have an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them are labeled for food
crops in one application or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paclobutazole is used on a number of the
tropical fruits where the trees tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: get real large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use Paclobutazole to keep the
trees from getting quite so large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice crops in several of the Asian
countries are treated with Paclobutazole
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it shorter and more compact and
stronger so that it pulls up in the fields
[SPEAKER_00]: until it can be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are used on food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Paclobutazole label that most of
us see is a product called bonsai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bonsai is used on ornamental crops,
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not used on food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that label does not have food crops on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other Paclobutazole labels
that do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm buying organic produce,
though, that would guarantee that these
[SPEAKER_02]: products are not being used on that crop,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said use the term guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to the best of our knowledge,
assuming that someone's not cheating the
[SPEAKER_02]: system, if you're buying certified
organic, then these products are not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no synthetic plant growth
regulators that are allowed for use in
[SPEAKER_02]: organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wanting to avoid wheat crops
that haven't been treated with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: products, then you're buying organic
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these things have been being used on
our organic produce for decades,
[SPEAKER_02]: it sounds like, from what you're saying,
like in the case of Paclobutazole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no research that you're aware
of regarding, say, combustion versus
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption of some of these chemicals,
which is something I wanted to highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any research to show what happens
when you burn Paclobutazole in the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue in the case of cannabis versus
eating it in, say, a rice crop or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, for a company who's selling
the product who has to pay for all this
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, there would not be a need for
them to do that kind of testing unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they're selling it right now into tobacco,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group of chemicals, none of these
are used on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no, I don't know of any testing to
see what would be the response would be on
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these products that are burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on to a couple other
plant growth regulators besides
[SPEAKER_02]: gibberellum inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about
trichontinol, because you and I were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about alfalfa, because we were
talking about maybe organic sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shared some stuff that I wasn't
aware of regarding trichontinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichontinol is a, gosh, I was at Michigan
State in, oh, it was about 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: 76 or something like that, working on my
PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the faculty members I was
working with made the discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichontinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really interesting molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting plant growth
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa is where it's been found in the
highest concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any commercial
trichontinol products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to a chemical supply company
and buy trichontinol, but that would be in
[SPEAKER_00]: a real concentrated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trichontinol in a concentrated form is
very, very difficult to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down very readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even if you, for example,
handle a spoon and get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: acid off of your fingers and then use that
spoon to handle the trichontinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll break the trichontinol down and so
live this activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where trichontinol has shown to really
have its best effect is using alfalfa as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch around plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the original work was actually an
accident using trichontinol as a mulch and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how much promotion and growth
occurred in some of the grain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the place for that is if a
cannabis producer has access to alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_00]: using that as a either incorporated into
the soil or as a mulch for in-ground
[SPEAKER_00]: plants would be the place that there would
be a real use there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes it works real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot of the plant hormones are
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it works real well and sometimes
it doesn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not any negative effects,
but when it works, the effects on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth are dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields, the things that are increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I were to, as an organic grower,
throw some alfalfa meal in my soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably not getting a lot of
trichontinol benefits because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably breaking down from what I'm
getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the pelletization process or even the
meal process with alfalfa affect
[SPEAKER_02]: trichontinol?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you talk about mulching, are we
talking about something more stem-y,
[SPEAKER_02]: more like the original plant crop itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now this goes beyond my real
experience because I have not worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: trichontinol since looking at it in
Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I familiar you with is getting
the performance from using the alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens when it's pollockized
and dried and that kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we can do our own research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some folks that are
looking at trichontinol now that have much
[SPEAKER_00]: more updated information than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, can we go back?
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we didn't really talk about is
what trichontinol does.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the benefits in terms of plant
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: It promotes photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It promotes growth, makes the plants more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say promotes photosynthesis,
would it allow the plant to take in more
[SPEAKER_02]: light, as in it could handle higher light
intensity, or that it allows it to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient with the amount of light it's
receiving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
Both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CO2, that's the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more efficient with, of course,
if you're an outside grower, you're locked
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural CO2 levels in the plant is
more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be worth trying some trials,
some controlled environment trials using
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious to do a little research or
learn more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's any negatives in terms
of pest habitat and other things like that
[SPEAKER_02]: that might offset.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll have to talk to Suzanne and kind
of pick her brain on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You touched on ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that there were a lot of
questions about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of ethylene, I think of
bananas and ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would one potentially use ethylene gas
to their benefit when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or detriment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there things to avoid in terms of
ripening or how this gas works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never treated a cannabis plant with
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a product called Ethafon that
can be used and is used on a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops to spray the Ethafon and then inside
the plant, it's converted to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would not be difficult to basically
apply ethylene to a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Responses that I would anticipate getting
would be enhanced leaf yellowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence to leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it on a little bit too early,
you can knock off flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so timing on ethylene and its
application in plants is a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that ethylene would
do is ethylene would tend to make a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely to be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a little bit of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where you're having a problem with
hermaphrodites, ethylene potentially would
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I anticipate that you'd see too many
negative effects with ethylene itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place for ethylene in cannabis is the
products that are preventing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from producing ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene is involved in sex expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis, a number of other plants,
if you block the ethylene natural
[SPEAKER_00]: production of ethylene in the plant,
it will shift from producing female
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers to male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where there are a number of
cannabis folks and particularly the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized hemp seed that's become so
popular in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be produced using a product
that blocks the natural ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: production in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't guess we need to get into how
you produce feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to take a female plant and
get male flowers and thus pollen produced
[SPEAKER_00]: on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that by blocking the ethylene
production in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I think of ethylene, I think of
post-production.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that after we harvest the bud and
it's in a jar, ethylene is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: building up in that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we burp the jar, we're going to
lower the ethylene levels in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we put the lid back on,
that process would restart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we're kind of
naturally regulating in the curing
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that way off base?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just made it that point that once
you dry that material, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get any more ethylene really produced by
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it's drying, though, is what I'm
wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe not once it's cured,
but as it's going through that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: curing process, like moving towards
homeostasis in terms of the leaf tissue,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there still ethylene being produced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at that point, is it done?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethylene production is going to be
decreasing just like all of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that tissue is first cut,
there is a big blast of ethylene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a natural thing that the plant
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's wounded, it produces a lot of
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as it's drying out, the amount of
ethylene that is produced will be
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of takes me in a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we go in and, say, prune our
flowering room and remove a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: material, and we're making a lot of plant
wounds, would that be a good time then to
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially do an air exchange to remove
any ethylene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that probably insignificant in terms
of the amount of ethylene that's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: being produced in a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the ethylene is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of that is sort of internal
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the tissues and moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, actually, I anticipate that,
particularly as we get closer to flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: and harvest, that a lot of what we're
doing is stimulating stress in that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it will produce more oils,
more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ethylene is involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our wounding of the plant at
that point is making the plant respond
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's being attacked by insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ethylene is a natural factor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jasmonic acid is a natural part of
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually benefiting from that
ethylene production when we wound the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at that stage.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plant stress, I think,
is a fascinating topic when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, it's pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've always been under the impression
with cannabis that, with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities that I've visited, that we have
no issues creating plant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always on the side of reducing
plant stress because it seems like every
[SPEAKER_02]: facility has something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no perfect grow out there,
at least as far as I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do wonder about targeted plant
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've heard of tomato farmers flooding
their fields with salinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of other, with other food
crops, targeted plant stress to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit production or flavonoids,
terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any research in that in
regards to cannabis or any direction in
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to our conversation that you
think might be interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: The research that has been done clearly
shows that the stress that's tend to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis and the way it's grown is
stimulating terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's as far as we really go
in our information about how to control
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it, but we're not controlling
it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our high salt stress, if we're drought
stressing, definitely the leaf removal,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the air that we're blowing over the
plants causes ethylene formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing a lot to stress the
plants, but we're not doing very much in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as the industry and the
information evolves, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out which are the best stressors
and when to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I haven't seen any research
that really tells us that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are a lot of individuals
that they feel like what those works best
[SPEAKER_00]: in their facility, but we don't understand
why behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I've even seen guys throw
ice cubes all over their soil prior to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest and freeze the plant and shock it
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You name it, I've seen it, I feel like on
the forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing to bring up is we have
a massive genetic diversity in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: when we talk about the selection of
cultivars that we're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you don't have that in other food
crops, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to affect things too,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to account for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the plant hormones, the plant
diversity is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works best or the dose or the timing
of the dose in one strain, if I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with tomatoes or geraniums or poinsettias
or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis folks call them strains in
agriculture, we call them varieties or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from one to another, the dose and the
timing is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum dose and timing is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is one of the most diverse
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from across the country, there's a
huge variation that we don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's an important thing to
remind people of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what may be perfect for one strain
or cultivar may have an entirely different
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you talk specifically about
gibberella, I can think of some plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that are already quite compact relative to
others that have huge internotal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's research on other crops that
tell me that there's big differences in
[SPEAKER_02]: the level of GA that's produced for those
different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on to another one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jasmonic acid or jasmineate is another one
that I've seen in relation to roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get off of that, and I'm not
following time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under the ethylene, we did not really
directly talk about silver phthalosulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for blocking ethylene, silver
phthalosulfate is a chemical that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are producing cannabis seed are
using to produce that male plant from a
[SPEAKER_00]: female clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver phthalosulfate is a chemical that's
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its effect on ethylene is really
pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy it on Amazon, a product with
the marijuana leaf on it and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, it is a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no federal or state labeling
that I know of for silver phthalosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's information on how to make it
yourself, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not a really safe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That silver is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from an environmental standpoint,
if you're using silver phthalosulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying it in a greenhouse or a
grow-through or something, you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, it's not a very safe
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another product that this other
product is called epilblock, or MCP is the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule, MCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a labeled product for use on
agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not labeled on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a safer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another product that stops
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called EBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a commercial product that's
used on apples called Retain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do something that's,
if you're doing something and none of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be labeled, I think you'd be
better off using a safer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: than a silver product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there are some people that
are talking about using a colloidal silver
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's the least efficient and
requires much more silver to do it and is
[SPEAKER_00]: more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's my two cents worth
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not an area I'm very
knowledgeable about.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an organic person, I think,
oh, silver, it's a metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a good option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, organic doesn't necessarily
equate safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of organic compounds that
are quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an important
distinction that you mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, and gibberellin, gibberellin,
gibberellin products are widely used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the markets and agricultural markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will tend to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite as efficient as the
silver phthalosulfate, but they will,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do the same thing if they're male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to come back to, you know,
we talked a little about Paclobutrazol,
[SPEAKER_02]: even when we're talking about safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did do a little quick Googling
and saw there was some research showing
[SPEAKER_02]: potential liver damage in rats related to
Paclobutrazol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, growers that were using it,
and it was in a lot of these hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: products, you know, found one thing to
realize is that people are putting stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: off label in these hydroponic nutrient
products, or they have in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the big challenge, you know,
and these are pretty major companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone knows the names of
these companies, and they were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a lot of money by selling these,
because if you can, it makes growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or growing cannabis a heck of a lot
easier if you can cut down your flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: times, that saves you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and other products, I know this
is, maybe a PGR, but I wanted to talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about Eagle 20 when we're
talking about some of these potential,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, products that people are using
in cannabis that are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to touch at all on,
do you have any familiarity with that
[SPEAKER_02]: product at all, in terms of?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm familiar enough with it that
I know what the situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a problem in the American
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets, you know, back to not knowing
what's in some of these things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased and used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to do the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to create really glossy
brochures and bright labels and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the marketing, the marketing can make
the product sound like that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the best thing since sliced
bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know everything that's in
there, and you don't know what is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where I come from
traditional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like information that is legal,
describes what the product is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it'll do, you know, how to use it,
and identifies everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sooner we can get to that,
and you know, 100% in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: market, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still just lots of material that
you can buy from Amazon or down at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the big box store or wherever,
online sources that I describe it
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the marketing is better than the
product itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would really encourage, you know,
anyone that's growing cannabis to really
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to the products that they're
using and making sure that they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important thing to me is that
we're always moving in a better direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I want to touch on that really
quickly, Jim, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a grower, to be able to use risky PGRs
and, you know, Michael butanol,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we're talking about when we say
something like Eagle 20, it makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's finishing sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's denser, you know, applying a systemic
pesticide allows us to not have to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about things like mites or things like
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it really easy for the grower to
grow a healthy looking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we talk about the risk associated
with it, you know, I want to highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: that one, it's risky to the to the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're exposing themselves to
higher levels of these toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably not doing it in a manner
that's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all off label and not researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't been trained.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a pesticide license to
apply these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a risk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the risk to the consumer,
like with Michael butanol, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read that, you know, it is used on a
lot of our food crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that that I think
growers use in defense of its use in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is no research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not allowed on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no research in terms of exposure
versus inhalation or via inhalation or
[SPEAKER_02]: absorption through the skin, as well as,
you know, when we when we burn it,
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly what I've read from,
you know, people smarter than me is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it releases a highly toxic gas or form a
cyanide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I worry that people growers look at
these PGRs or, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides are systemic and they can say,
oh, well, they're used on apples or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're used on mangoes or rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when you say, you know,
this this thing about labels, I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can highlight that enough
because these labels are there's hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: of thousands of dollars, if not millions
of dollars behind the creation and testing
[SPEAKER_02]: of what they're allowed to put on this
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I mean, sometimes the
government regulations are good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a any pesticide product to get a label
for cannabis, a federal label for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residues have to be established,
all of that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be a much, much safer
situation for us, even if you just talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the current problems with
the organic certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a federal certification and you can't
get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call it organic or natural or
something, but it's not tested to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and if you really get an organic,
I mean, if you go to a grocery store and
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy an organic tomato, it has a little
label on there that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that says it's been certified as being
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an independent agency has to come in
and evaluate what that farmer producer is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to make sure that they're following
all the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're just selling any kind of
product, and saying that it's natural and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe or just using the term organic
without using the official label,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no one is actually inspecting that
and certifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's where I think as we move
in that direction of more federal
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation in this in this space would be
a lot better off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really it really comes down to knowing
your grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are certifications out there
like I don't know if you've heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: certified kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Andrew Black, where he is following
the same standards that the N.O.P.
[SPEAKER_02]: uses and actually doing and doing testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is there's just not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess not enough public awareness
around it, you know, to where that
[SPEAKER_02]: certification has as much value as I think
it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that certified organic
sticker when we go into the grocery store
[SPEAKER_02]: carries a lot of weight, at least for
someone like me, I'm putting a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: trust behind it compared to, you know,
I'm paying what, 50 cents a dollar or more
[SPEAKER_02]: for my produce, you know, and I realize
that I'm paying for that certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for that company to do that
work and know that my product is what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: eating is grown in a way that fits with
my, you know, my ethics or my morality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, you're absolutely right that
that is a challenging cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we might want to
discuss just a little bit, I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that you had some questions
about the temperature and affecting growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we refer to as the difference in
day and night temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three things I want to cover with
you before signing off, I know we're
[SPEAKER_02]: running a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was was that topic, how adjusting
temperatures may work similar to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of these PGRs and how that
might be useful?
[SPEAKER_02]: For people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about jasmonic acid and I
want to talk about stability because
[SPEAKER_02]: people are making a lot of, you know,
ferments or applying organic products like
[SPEAKER_02]: kelp meal, for example, and thinking that
they're getting these various PGRs or
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa and how I want to talk about how
stable these things actually are to know
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're if they're potentially even in
the final product to say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are getting some of these natural PGRs
or no, they're probably, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: disappearing before they ever really have
an effect on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would you like to start?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, Diff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diff is basically short for difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the difference in the day and
night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a natural situation, nights are
cooler than the days are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a positive difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's 65 degrees at night,
75 degrees during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a positive 10 degree diff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lower that difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even going to a negative diff,
you create shorter inner nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller plants, very, very similar to a
Pachybutazole effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a greenhouse, or in a any controlled
environment, you have the capability of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling your day and night
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of getting a 10 degree
difference, you lower it to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: two degrees or zero, you will see a much
more compact plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it one step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the smaller the diff, the smaller the
inner node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take it one step further,
is that if you make your nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature cooler, I mean, warmer than
your daytime temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say your nighttime temperature is
70 degrees and your day temperature is 68
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, you'll have an even more compact
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's some challenges around
that with lighting and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, particularly in a greenhouse kind of
setting where you're doing natural
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation, there is an important period
that is about one hour before sunrise and
[SPEAKER_00]: two to three hours after sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when, in a 24 hour period,
the plant is most responsive to these
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a technique that's sometimes
called the morning dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going through the night and
your temperature is 70 degrees during the
[SPEAKER_00]: night, about an hour before sunrise,
lower the temperature to something like
[SPEAKER_00]: 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep it low for about three hours
after sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let it go up to a natural day
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you the most compact plant
you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's quite a bit of information on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go into all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sort of threw the big picture at you
real quick there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do an internet search for
plant response to death or difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: day and night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll find quite a bit of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty widely used in flower crops
that are used in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have not done it on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know anyone who is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm guessing there are some folks out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some consultants that are very
familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm guessing that there are some folks
that are playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis looks like it would be a
perfect crop to try this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, everyone's dealing
with humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works best if you're in a situation
where you can manage humidity at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, at least on cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to hear from people that do more
research on this and experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the nice things about it
compared to using Pactobutasol is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: put Pactobutasol in the plant,
when you put it in the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This DILF concept, you can manipulate it
and give it two or three days one way and
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three days another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want the plants a little taller,
you can make it a little more positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want them compact, they'll respond
within two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can turn it on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anything more on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want to jump into jasmonic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is one that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's tons and tons of research
being done by botanists who are studying
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in the cannabis industry,
there's quite a bit of interest in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasmonic acid is involved in stress
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It responses the plant to natural stresses
like temperature and drought stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also response to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is part of the process of the
plant adjusting the way it's growing to
[SPEAKER_00]: account for the stress that it's under.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned earlier that I think
that in what we're doing in the way we're
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing plants, we are causing the plant
to be producing its own jasmonic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it would naturally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, jasmonic acid reduces growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also working in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working with the other hormones,
the gibberellins and ethylene and IA
[SPEAKER_00]: auctions, to adjust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the stress level goes down,
the growth might go back up and those
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a jasmonic acid product being
sold on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no information about how to
use it, doses, timing, those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen evidence that jasmonic works
on producing plants treated with jasmonic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid produce more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's that whole issue of the
huge number of terpenes and how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: apply and things like that and how it
affects different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, I don't know that anyone
can tell you this is what to do to use and
[SPEAKER_00]: be successful with jasmonic acid on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there is definitely some
potential there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like most of the hormone things,
there's so many ways that the hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with all the other conditions,
how much fertilizer we're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that we're already stressing the
plant so much that if you go out and start
[SPEAKER_00]: treating with jasmonic acid, you get more
negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a concern, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I think it is an interesting area
to look at, it's not one that if someone
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like they're an early adopter,
they might go trial it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't go out there and bet the
farm on it, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jim, is there any legal uses of
jasmonic acid on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How safe is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen jazz spray for roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how safe is it compared to,
say, paclobutrazol or some of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is they all kind of in that same
category of just untested and we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really know the safety of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely untested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of any jasmonic acid product
is being sold in agriculture that has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through the sort of rigors of testing that
EPA requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my feeling is that it's going to be
relatively safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But arsenic is a natural product,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We absolutely need to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely one that I think has
some potential use of force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that the system that we're
currently using isn't the best system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be better for us to do some more
things to reduce stress early in the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and then stress it at the end with a
jasmonic acid treatment, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a better production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would anticipate as you go up in scale
and start doing larger production areas
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to do more exact timing that
getting away from our current stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: will make it more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we can apply a naturally
occurring material near the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to jump that turpentine production,
that's probably a better system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might find that it's better to just
use salt stress two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that is being the best way
to produce the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the biggest takeaway I've gotten
from my conversation with you today is
[SPEAKER_02]: just an understanding of what these PGRs
are and how they work inside of a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: would give a grower a better understanding
in terms of potential manipulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth and plant stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think just a better understanding of
botany and some of these chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions is useful for a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my flower growers that I worked with
for years and doing grower seminars on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the inhibitors like Paxibutazole
and that kind of thing, I told the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience over and over again if the
question they ask me is what dose to put
[SPEAKER_00]: on or what rate to use, my answer to that
is don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is the last thing you decide
after you look at all of the other inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences in your temperatures,
your light levels, the irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain that you're growing,
all of that, then you decide how much to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of potential,
but it also requires a more technical
[SPEAKER_00]: growing strategy, I guess is the way to
put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, none of these chemicals
that we mentioned are legal to use on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're certainly not encouraging
growers to go out there and use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important thing I want to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis, absolutely right now in
the US, at least, is look at your state
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements and what's legal to use in
that state that varies from state to
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're across the border in Canada,
the same absolute chemical may be legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and not anywhere in the US or vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all gets down to local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that whole issue, I think we're
going to be doing more and more testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things really last for a
long time in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, honestly, my motivation as an
organic grower with this podcast was not
[SPEAKER_02]: only to educate people, but to hopefully
discourage them if they were using them
[SPEAKER_02]: and realize some of the potential risks
associated with use, not just to
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, but to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, I know some people
are going to still continue to apply these
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but at least maybe they'll have a
little more education and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: consider not using them in their grow if
they are because, frankly, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't I personally don't believe it
to be safe, but we don't ultimately know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that's the biggest thing for
people to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's let's dive into this last
question so you can get back to your get
[SPEAKER_02]: back to your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to know about stability of these
PGRs because, like, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I used to make willow water to
try and extract IBA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've experimented with kelp meal
and seaweed extract powder and alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, trying to potentially capture
natural sources of these PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How stable are these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I wasn't aware of triacontinol being
so unstable to where I probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I was getting other benefits
from alfalfa, but probably not the
[SPEAKER_02]: triacontinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what about some of these other
ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxen materials that are used for
rooting, the naturally occurring oxens
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be very unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of exposure to light,
you know, and they break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of the reason that we don't
use natural IAA in propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the synthetic materials that hold
up longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't looked into this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely an area that I have not
looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't answer your question directly,
other than it varies a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we make assumptions as grovers
that because we hear, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with alfalfa or with kelp that
it contains oxens and gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cytokines that when we apply it,
we're getting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, what you're saying is
that potentially these PGRs are not as
[SPEAKER_02]: stable and they may not be making it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may not be getting that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may be getting other effects,
but not necessarily the purported benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: of PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very fair to say.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, naturally occurring material,
the natural occurring hormones in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tend to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the ways that they regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant regulates what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get into a system where
you're applying them natural products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got that same issue a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the processing done?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things like the oxens that break
down at high temperatures, the processing
[SPEAKER_00]: may break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it may not be very high levels in
the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned quite a bit of stuff about PGRs
that I wasn't aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I really thank you for sharing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it's been helpful for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, I'd like to mention,
Jim, you are fully retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not currently doing any consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for folks that listen to this,
please don't attempt to contact Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's enjoying his retirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let him talk to my granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, have a wonderful rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
