[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a ton of products on the
market and new stuff popping up every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my social media feeds, I see ads for
gardening products all the time that claim
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the best or something I absolutely
need for my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you sort through all the
marketing hype and get to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's really worth your time and money?
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought Suzanne Wade Wright Evans back
to help me with this podcast because she
[SPEAKER_02]: has a long background in both the cannabis
industry and the horticulture industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: so she has really seen both sides and how
different marketing is between the two
[SPEAKER_02]: industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is really a discussion on how
to evaluate products and what questions I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you should be asking as a grower
when evaluating a product or inputs into
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: From pesticides to compost, we cover it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you missed the previous podcast
with Suzanne, which are more focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM and cannabis pests, she is an
ornamental entomologist specializing in
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been involved in the green industry
for more than 25 years with a primary
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on biological control and using
pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a graduate of the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: and environmental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses, nurseries, landscapers,
and interior escape companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the owner of Bug Lady Consulting,
now in business for over 16 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Suzanne, really appreciate you coming
back on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to have you on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always a pleasure to be able to
talk with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, you and I have talked a
lot off the air about a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: products and how to evaluate products and
how to look at biocontrols and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually had me come down to the
biocontrols conference to give a talk on
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly this subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just thought it was so important
that we might want to cover it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and let me let me cut in because I'm
going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a phenomenal presentation you
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that missed it really missed
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really once everybody gets to go
back to meetings and conferences,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think I'm not going to be pushing
for you to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same talk at other events, because I think
you had a really, really good message and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard nothing but amazing things about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for coming and doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad that it went it went pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, public speaking is tough for me,
but I'm glad I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a wonderful opportunity right
before this whole pandemic hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to really dive in on this topic,
just to keep things moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to talk about a general
overview of how we evaluate a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to talk more specifically
with you about how do we evaluate media,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we evaluate nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really your wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we evaluate pesticides and
biocontrols in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: So and microbial inputs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking from a general overview,
I want to just highlight a few points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to just jump in with
any suggestions, thoughts as we go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're talking about a product in
general, the first thing I want to say is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's no such thing as a good
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is such thing as a bad product for
your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of snake oil products out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the reasons we're doing
this podcast in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of a good product,
I hear people all the time like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, you know, my buddy's using product X
in their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get products X in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you think about I get question
emails like, hey, should I add product X
[SPEAKER_02]: into my into my regimen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question or my response to them is
really like, well, what's in the product
[SPEAKER_02]: and what is your garden actually need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this is an important thing
to really highlight at the beginning is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, for example, if we're talking about
nutrients, if your plant is or your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: is lacking nitrogen and you add a product
that has nitrogen in it, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a good plant response.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good product to apply and you're
going to have a healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if your soil already has
sufficient levels of nutrients or nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: in this case, by adding more nitrogen,
you're not actually going to be improving
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality of your soil, the health of
your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could actually cause toxicities
and other problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I guess, what I want to get at
when I say there's no such thing as a good
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really have to look at our garden
holistically and make a determination
[SPEAKER_02]: based on what the limiting factors of
growth are for our plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to comment on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can have the best products in
a way in the world, but if your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need them, there's no point in using
them because I get that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask all the time, product X,
should I be spraying this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is, do you need it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because a product may work well
in a particular pest or resolve a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular nutritional issue, only if your
crop needs it, is it necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're dead on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to evaluate if those
products actually do what they claim
[SPEAKER_01]: because I see a lot of claims on a lot of
products, thus part of the tin foil hat
[SPEAKER_01]: issue, and without any science to back
them up, which is a very important part of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to decide if you need a product or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually brings up my next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put together a list of just a few
different things that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight that I keep in my head whenever
I'm thinking about any product and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially adding it to my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these questions are the
following here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, what are the ingredients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they using high quality inputs?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the manufacturing or processes
involved?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they tell me it's proprietary,
that's my first red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are willing to share,
if they're legitimate, at least some of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on with the product that
they're making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't understand the mechanism
of action, like I've had some people
[SPEAKER_02]: adding sea salt, some of these salt-based
sodium products that where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting sea water out of the middle of
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, why do I want to be adding this to
my garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not able to give me a really
solid answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I really struggle with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're not willing to tell me exactly
how they're manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a special process that they can't
share because it would give everything
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a big red flag for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to touch on that on before I
mention the next one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a pest management standpoint,
from pesticides and if it kills a pest,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soaps and oils and all that are
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides is not necessarily a bad word.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the products are EPA registered for
their active ingredient in the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: active means that's the part of the
product that gets the work done,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to list what it is because that
way you know exactly what you're applying
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are innards in there and those
often are the carriers, which could be
[SPEAKER_01]: different powders, towels, clay,
oils and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily have to give you
all the innard information, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find a lot of the information like on MSDS
sheets and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the reasons why I'm a
little lean more towards some of the EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: registered products is because they have
to be a bit more forthcoming with you
[SPEAKER_01]: about what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you're not necessarily going to
be able to find out all the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and I was talking to a friend of
mine who she works at a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing company and she said that
for their fertilizer input before they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: even offload the innards to the factory or
the input products, they're heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the products right on the truck to
make sure that even before they unload,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no heavy metals in it to make sure
purity of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And companies telling you they're doing
things like that really make you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better about using those products and they
do have set standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, I think that is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to give an example of what you
mentioned, like for example, the first
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I thought of, and I know you're not
a huge fan of it, but is neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we're talking about an active
ingredient of azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also, you know, there's derivatives
like azamax, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and neem oil, the active ingredient is
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The azadirachtin is a derivative that
comes from the neem plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that's not really an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an insect growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually two products that come
out of the neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's lots of products come out of
the neem tree, but as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are concerned, you know,
you basically have neem oil, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocant and also has a repelling
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have azadirachtin,
which is the active in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, I don't know, like 10,
15 different products on the market now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have- Azamax, azatrol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you say that, so would neem oil
have to, without getting off on a tangent,
[SPEAKER_02]: would neem oil have to list azadirachtin
as an active ingredient if it's EPA
[SPEAKER_02]: certified?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because- Or registered?
[SPEAKER_01]: The azadirachtin, to my understanding,
has been removed out of it because,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's an oil you're spraying,
not an insect growth regulator with the
[SPEAKER_01]: neem product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a suffocant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're splitting what they're getting out
of the plant apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've seen azadirachtin levels on
tests of neem-based products as part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could, that could have, and this is
the, neem's been very inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been, you know, I don't want to
say issues makes it sound bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, I would say it's a pretty
inconsistent product because it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a botanical because it's coming from
a plant and the harvesting methods and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants themselves can be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where they're grown,
how they're, you know, raised,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like how cannabis is a perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you extract from cannabis and
how it's grown, you get different
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible there's traces of it in
there, but it's not sold as an
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a separate product in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, there could be,
because there has been these contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: issues with the neem oils with the other
synthetic pesticides, it's possible there
[SPEAKER_01]: could be some azadirachtin contamination
potentially happening too at the
[SPEAKER_01]: processing facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't, I wasn't aware of that
distinction between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you look at the label and you look
at what the active is and either it'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: neem oil or it will say azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like azadirachtin being an insect
growth regulator, what that does is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it regulates the growth of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it prevents them from being able to
basically molt into their next life stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it works very well on immature
insects where if you've got a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of adult insects, azadirachtin really
isn't necessarily great for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: where neem oil working as a suffocant
would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And moving on to my second point here is
one you kind of already mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the product certified?
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it registered as organic,
EPA certified?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it registered as a fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: With living soils, we don't have that
requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I know my company, we chose to do
that registration because of the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that we're putting into our
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that registration or level of
certification requires a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires me to put an MPK level on my
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by taking it a step further and
getting certified organic, they're tracing
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, all of my inputs, all the way
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's someone out there that knows my
recipe with the organic certification and
[SPEAKER_02]: is verifying that the inputs are organic,
that they're all registered, that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed for use in organic production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it's not a perfect system because
someone could go through all of this and
[SPEAKER_02]: then still throw in an ingredient that
you're not allowed to use, guardian mite
[SPEAKER_02]: spray would be a great example of that on
the pesticide side, there is at least some
[SPEAKER_02]: level of oversight and regulation around
the product and testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Oregon Department of Agriculture,
WSDA here in Washington will go out off of
[SPEAKER_02]: a shelf and pull a product and check the
weight on it, check the label,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure everything's correct,
do a nutrient analysis and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: what is being claimed on the label matches
up with what you're actually receiving in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottle or in the box or in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a product certified is just one
more level of protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, but it is something to
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to touch a little bit
about what that EPA registration is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this is one of the really
important points around pesticides with
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of what type of registration that
they're able to get or what they have
[SPEAKER_02]: around a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it used to be that if you claimed
any pesticide activity, like if you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: my product kills aphid, my product kills
mites, my product kills rats, even
[SPEAKER_01]: rodenticides fall under pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: By law, you had to have it registered with
the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each state then reviews labels because
you'll see with pesticides like the label
[SPEAKER_01]: in California can be different than New
York, or you can have products we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: in Florida, but then we can't use them in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then on top of it, each state kind of
looks at the product and makes decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: on it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But about, I'm trying to remember the
exact year, maybe about 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know this off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government said, listen,
there's certain products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary oil is a really good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it has pesticidal properties,
but we also know it's pretty safe for
[SPEAKER_01]: humans because it's in a lot of cosmetics,
it's in food, it's in a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people are using it and we know it's
safe, then we're not gonna require you to
[SPEAKER_01]: register a product if that's the active
ingredient in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a list from the EPA,
if you go, the 25B list is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: names they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically you have these exempt
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, again, all that means is
those products are safe for humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that they're good
miticides or insecticides or are safe for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants by any stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the cannabis industry really
kicking up over the last few years and
[SPEAKER_01]: people looking for products, there has
been this flood to the market of these
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are not EPA registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a very much buyer beware
situation because we don't always know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really not a lot of oversight
federally on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you contact these companies and
say, okay, do you have any trial data?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to get specific
information where when you have something
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA registered, you can definitely get a
lot more information on the product
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's such higher requirements
through the EPA to get a product
[SPEAKER_01]: registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes years and years, there's lots
of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they have to do all this bee
testing now to make sure your product's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be safe for bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those exempt products don't have to go
through any of that rigorous testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where you can really see the
differences out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cannabis industry has really
exploded with these exempt products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the perfect lead into the next
question that I keep in my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, is the product found outside of
the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you wanna explain why that might be an
important variable to consider when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at a product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I say this all the time in my
presentations that when you look at,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say poinsettia growers, their profit
margins are so low on poinsettia,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes just a few pennies a pot that
they can't afford to use products that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always say to my cannabis guys,
all these wonderful cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_01]: why aren't other industries really using
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what my experience has been and
what we've tested is because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times they don't work that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the ability to get information on
a product that is EPA registered as a
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just so much more
information available for these EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: registered products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see my non-cannabis growers using
many of these products for these non-EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: registered products, because again,
they can't get information, they can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: trial information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, sometimes it's a mystery to
what's really in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a lot of them are botanical oils,
which can be highly phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another big concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with EPA registered products,
of course you can have phytotoxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because of liability reasons,
the companies do a lot of thorough testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and generally the labels will tell you
exactly what you can and cannot use
[SPEAKER_01]: products on to prevent lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have seen lawsuits where people
have sprayed a product, it's killed the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, and then they've sued the
manufacturer of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a feeling one of these days
this is gonna happen in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I haven't heard of any things
like that happening, but I've absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it happen in the ornamental market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that brings up some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some questions for me around
phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned botanical oils when you talk
about phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you can share around
that that might be a warning to listeners
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of potential active ingredients
that might be more likely to cause
[SPEAKER_02]: phytotoxicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but it's hard to know because
sometimes they don't break down the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you really knew that this
particular bottle of product you just paid
[SPEAKER_01]: $100 for has 1% rosemary and half a
percent thyme and 1% garlic extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: so really there's about $3 maybe of active
ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can understand what the markup on
these products are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I understand that people are
trying to make a competitive product and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't wanna hand your formula to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with any EPA registered product,
when a new product comes to market with my
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental growers, we always do trials
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, is it safe for the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we see any phytotoxicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, does it actually do what it
says it does?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the advantage that a lot of the
universities do trial these EPA registered
[SPEAKER_01]: products for ornamentals and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that as a resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping down the road because a lot of
the land-grant universities are now
[SPEAKER_01]: working on hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get more trial work through that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's tough for the growers and it's
tough for the growers to know if the
[SPEAKER_01]: claims are really true or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest things that makes me
just wanna bang my head on the wall is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I see people all the time promoting
their amazing unicorn tier pesticide only
[SPEAKER_01]: kills pests like hemp russet mite,
but it's absolutely safe for your
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the synthetic chemistries
which can't be used in cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: at this time, we actually do have some
very, very targeted pesticides that work
[SPEAKER_01]: on very specific metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a one miticide that's made by BASF
that's pretty safe with most beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually spray it over top of
predatory mites, but it absolutely smokes
[SPEAKER_01]: two-spot spider mites, immatures,
adults, and eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the synthetic world, we do have some
pretty good products like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to the non-EPA
registered stuff, which almost all are
[SPEAKER_01]: killing more as a suffocant or a
desiccant, they're broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're gonna be non-selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with soaps and oils,
you have to be very careful of particle
[SPEAKER_01]: size because again, of phytotoxicity and
actually will they kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of interesting to look too
at the differences between the oils
[SPEAKER_01]: because rosemary oil, which has been
abused a bit more and there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: products that have been trying to go
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limitation there is cost because
rosemary oil is very expensive and it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good alternative because there's no
REI or reentry interval with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can spray it and your workers can
go back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is rosemary oil
does not work well on like spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs, where the petroleum oils,
the paraphonetic oils, they smoke spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all oils are the same and they all
do not perform the same out in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that kind of touched on the next
point that I had here, which was what
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and research do you have to
support the claims that they're making
[SPEAKER_02]: around the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what of that research are they willing
to share with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really important that we
ask those questions and then be very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very critical of what responses we get
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Critical in the sense of that we're really
evaluating what they're saying and not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting overwhelmed by quote unquote
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a guy recently that was making a
claim about how their microbial product
[SPEAKER_02]: made up for low light conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I reached out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, do you have research on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sent me an encyclopedia on quantum
physics and said that this answered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, this has nothing to do
with what you're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very scientific looking,
but again, had nothing to do with actually
[SPEAKER_02]: answering or supporting the claim that
they were making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a really time consuming part
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're talking about adding
something into our garden, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: critical that we spend the time to really
research what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously having peer review research
is really nice, but that's difficult when
[SPEAKER_02]: we start talking about the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is anecdotal, experiential,
word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some research more and more
coming out daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you mentioned, there's research
on other crops that doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: cross over perfectly, but at least give us
a trend or an indication as to the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of our product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you evaluate research yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much if you want to test it out
yourself, because that's my next one I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you wanted to look at what body of
research existed about a product,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's take pesticide X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would you start in that sort of
testing research, supporting the claims
[SPEAKER_02]: world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Online or through your contacts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I always want to dissect the product
and know, again, with the actives in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at a product,
and let's just say product X, since we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking about rosemary, and I'm not
picking on rosemary oil, because it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: a very good product in the right
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OK, we know it contains rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I want to go look and see what
research has been done on rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you mentioned how there's not a
lot of research done on cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, on some of the
ornamental crops, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where a lot of research is done is on
food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of have to go to food crop
research and see what I can extract out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that to see how it applies to what I'm
actually working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do what's called a literature
search, where you do a search for research
[SPEAKER_01]: papers that have been published.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to look at active ingredients
of what's the active in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to look for any research on
rosemary oil and see what's been done
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world on rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that I look at
that's really important is how is the
[SPEAKER_01]: research done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all know if you want a
particular answer, you can skew the way
[SPEAKER_01]: you do things to make it happen a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that how pesticides are applied is
really important because a lot of pests
[SPEAKER_01]: can just be blown off a plant with a spray
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're doing a trial and you're
only doing four plants and those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting sprayed with the active,
but with a good jet of water, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's not the mechanical means
removing those pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had some questions about some
pesticides that, is it the spraying action
[SPEAKER_01]: that removes the pest or was it the actual
active ingredient?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when researchers today do
research on the microbial products,
[SPEAKER_01]: products that contain like Bavaria and
Isaria and Metarizium and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, these beneficial fungus,
what they actually do is they isolate the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus out of the commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 100% pure product and there are no
inners to make sure that they're applying
[SPEAKER_01]: just the straight active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies typically will not just provide
the straight active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the microbials, they actually have
to isolate it out and look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how they do the applications is very
important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the kind of stuff I look at to
see like, okay, does this make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you have to look at, again,
how the research is done because if it is
[SPEAKER_01]: done, but again, they're testing four
plants in a research greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they did that, can it be ramped up
to five acres or 10 acres?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it can't because oftentimes
researchers aren't looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: economics of doing something for pest
management and how much it's gonna cost
[SPEAKER_01]: them labor and the reality of spray
coverage because again, research
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, they're all nice and spaced
out and you can get full coverage from
[SPEAKER_01]: every side and you can take time to spray
everything where you go to any commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and people just like running down
the aisles trying to spray as fast as they
[SPEAKER_01]: can and you don't get the same kind of
spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why sometimes you can get one
result in research and another in real
[SPEAKER_01]: world because of application differences,
how much water is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many variables, but we need the
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it from a starting point because
if let's just say rosemary oil was sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: and they saw no efficacy at all under
ideal conditions, well, then it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna work under sub-ideal conditions
in a commercial growing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so generally that's where I start and
then I pick up my little bug phone and I
[SPEAKER_01]: call my university friends and other
people I know that have worked in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for a long time with science
background and when we talk about what are
[SPEAKER_01]: we seeing because kind of the proof is in
the pudding once stuff gets out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, whether it's gonna work or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at all of that kind of
make decisions on if it's a product I
[SPEAKER_01]: should recommend or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tell you with the products that are
targeting specific for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, it's nearly impossible to get
like solid research from the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: saying here's the trial, here's the
protocol we use and here's our results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to get that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and I remember in my talk I went to a
particular website of a pretty famous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis nutrient company that I won't
mention here on the podcast and they had
[SPEAKER_02]: these charts that were just incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Product X causes 75% better growth and is
reported by master growers to produce 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: better trichome density or some ridiculous
number, but then they have no reference to
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual study that they conducted and
when you write to them and ask them for it
[SPEAKER_02]: they say that that's proprietary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that research really isn't useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably doesn't even exist,
but they had a cool bar graph supposedly
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting it and when you're looking at
research it's so tough because like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said you actually have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have been a researcher that had
four tents up in a controlled environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and like you said four plants or even 20
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really low end value.
[SPEAKER_02]: The statistical power of that is
relatively speaking is fairly low and we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to see it replicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing about these trials is we
can't draw huge conclusions from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can say well this shows a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a likelihood that because of this
research we're going to get similar
[SPEAKER_02]: results, but too many times I see people
conclusively cite research and say that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know this causes this to happen and we
really have to be cautious with that and
[SPEAKER_02]: we really have to read the research really
carefully and like you mentioned the
[SPEAKER_02]: application method, the application rate,
on the soil and nutrient side when we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about those sort of things we have to look
at what was already existing in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of plants are they growing in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so many things we have to
consider before we draw like any hard
[SPEAKER_02]: conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming we get through this testing and
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to add I think one of the
most classic you know we think we know the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer and oh my gosh we were wrong kind
of thing and I know the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you guys don't use that a
metacloprid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't send me hate mail because I
said a metacloprid, but it's a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: example of how research could be done by
good people doing good things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but can be wrong because of replications
and what the situation was when a
[SPEAKER_01]: metacloprid it was being used to treat
pests in the state of New York on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: par central the trees in central parks and
things like that and what was interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: is they started to notice trees that were
treated with a metacloprid how to flare up
[SPEAKER_01]: of spider mites afterwards that you treat
metacloprid boom those plants ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: with spider mites and everybody went to
the conclusion that well because the
[SPEAKER_01]: metacloprid is systemic that a lot of
beneficials in in addition to eating the
[SPEAKER_01]: meat of the insects are also plant feeders
pollen and nectar or they drink plant
[SPEAKER_01]: juices and so that they assumed that the a
metacloprid was killing the beneficials
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is what was said for a while
until they started looking going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking closer and what they actually
found is yes a metacloprid can kill some
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials, but that's not what was
causing this they found that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: treated with a metacloprid actually were
basically more nutritious and that the
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites that were feeding on these
plants were like super spider mites it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like getting super vitamins and they were
the females are actually laying more eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: and being much more productive and so it
was just like a metacloprid triggered the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to feed the spider mites better and
so it seemed like at first a metacloprid
[SPEAKER_01]: was you know killing the beneficials and
that was why we have the mite issues but
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't and so that's why we need
replications over and over stuff stuff has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be peer reviewed you need a lot of
people putting input in on this and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know some great work University of
Maryland was heavily involved with that
[SPEAKER_01]: and they did some great work on that and
and this is what's hard is because it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes years to figure this stuff out and
you have a grower standing there saying my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are dying right now I need an
answer now and so it's very difficult and
[SPEAKER_01]: with the lack of funding going to research
the lack of researchers it's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing but harder and harder to get this
good information out there so it makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: cringe when people say oh I had this pest
issue I sprayed this and it totally went
[SPEAKER_01]: away when the product to me in my head
doesn't make sense and you know there
[SPEAKER_01]: could be other things going on that the
growers aren't even aware of that's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: example I hadn't heard that one I'm not
I'm not very familiar with like
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional chemistry so it's cool to hear
that but that really does highlight the
[SPEAKER_02]: point that we're trying to make but let's
just assume that we get through all of
[SPEAKER_02]: this process and you're like you know I
still want to give this product a shot
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where it comes to testing it out
using controls and determining if the
[SPEAKER_02]: product is valid can you talk a little bit
about how you would set up a trial or a
[SPEAKER_02]: test let's just say in a really small grow
just to make it simple how would you how
[SPEAKER_02]: would you isolate for a product X to
determine if it is a controlling variable
[SPEAKER_01]: or not well and this is challenging
because I mean I think growers need to
[SPEAKER_01]: test products don't get me wrong and many
of my larger greenhouse facilities they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have their own in-house research
people to do this stuff but most cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities don't the problem is is
oftentimes because the plants are so
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable in cannabis you can't afford to
sacrifice you know five plants and just
[SPEAKER_01]: say hey we're not going to treat these
plants where with poinsettias and mums
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super easy to sacrifice a few plants
so that creates a challenge in itself also
[SPEAKER_01]: if those plants if you're not treating
them they can become a problem for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pest and you know all of a sudden your
pest numbers spike on those plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: spread to other plants now you can cage
plants and this is something that's often
[SPEAKER_01]: done I've got you know like a dozen cages
here at my house that I put plants in they
[SPEAKER_01]: have little you know zip windows on them
if you ever need them you get them from
[SPEAKER_01]: bioquip out in California and what you can
do is you can put your plants inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then you zip them closed and
that way they're isolated because what one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the biggest problems you have when you
know let's say you have a plant covered
[SPEAKER_01]: with aphids and you want to test if
product X will kill them what happens if
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs show up what happens of lace
wings show up what happens if a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring fungus show up and and that can
really mess your trial up and so the cages
[SPEAKER_01]: will help exclude beneficials from getting
in there but it also can create a micro
[SPEAKER_01]: climate when you're treating those plants
so it can be challenging I think that with
[SPEAKER_01]: growers if they have a good scout and a
good pest management program you know they
[SPEAKER_01]: can tag certain plants they're not going
to treat and then tag certain plants they
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to treat but they have to be
under the same environmental conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to be on the same nutrients I
mean they have to be identical in all ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to see if the product is going to work for
them but it's very difficult if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go spray these plants but not
those over there spray drift because spray
[SPEAKER_01]: drift pesticides drift further than people
often realize and so that can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging and and this is why a lot of
people just are like let the universities
[SPEAKER_01]: do the work and then you know because
they've got the setup they have research
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses they have growth chambers they
have all this isolated stuff to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this but again in the in the cannabis
situation it's not so easy you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch the hemp research because you know
Virginia Tech doing a lot on hemp Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: State's doing a lot on hemp Cornell has
gotten a chunk of money to do research on
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and you know there will be papers
being published coming out on that from
[SPEAKER_01]: those universities but as far as a grower
setting the trial I mean I hate to say it
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't think most cannabis growers
are in a position to necessarily test
[SPEAKER_01]: products without really focusing on that
and maybe having an isolated area to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in or to be able to space their plants out
because cannabis growers tend to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: really tight and you know if your plants
are touching and one's getting sprayed and
[SPEAKER_01]: one's not again the pesticide is going to
end up on the other one you can let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted to test a product for spider
mites let's say and if you have several
[SPEAKER_01]: infected leaves and you can kind of look
at those leaves and then if you carefully
[SPEAKER_01]: spray them with the pesticide product and
then wait 24 hours and come back and look
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get an idea of what's going on but
what's difficult about that is think about
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're just going to spray one leaf
compared to spraying a plant and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up with a lot more active
ingredient on that leaf than you would if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're spraying a whole plant and so it
kind of skews you know the reality of how
[SPEAKER_01]: you really spray compared to a trial spray
there so that's you know it's a difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do I think the biggest mistake
growers make is they don't assess well
[SPEAKER_01]: after they use a product and report back
what they see you know before they spray
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if they found let's say 10 spider
mites eggs per leaf they come through they
[SPEAKER_01]: spray product X and they come back if
those eggs have hatched out in a few days
[SPEAKER_01]: then the product didn't work if the eggs
are dead well then you know the product
[SPEAKER_01]: worked so it's that follow-up and scouting
after you've done treatments I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really critical and using the sticky cards
to monitor numbers will really help
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate a product I know that was a lot
and I'm sorry no it's interesting because
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at it from a pest perspective
like you do so that's why I'm glad I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this podcast with you one other
factor or variable I want to mention with
[SPEAKER_02]: specific specifically with pesticides is
the sprayer itself yep that's a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: world too in terms of particle size and
dispersion and all of that I mean what a
[SPEAKER_01]: nightmare yeah so Michael Brown bridge I'm
not sure I think he said this on one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the webinars we did you know where you
know you can have a bad product and a good
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer and it's not gonna work but if you
have a good product in a bad sprayer it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not gonna work so the sprayers
can make all the difference in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've had several people tell me that
once they've gone from paint sprayers
[SPEAKER_01]: cement sprayers you know the Home Depot
special backpack sprayer to you know
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial sprayers of the right nozzles
it's made it's made their products work
[SPEAKER_01]: that much better especially with the
horticultural oils because you can't have
[SPEAKER_01]: big gloppy droppy particles you need a
fine almost aerosol mist on those leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: with the oils so let's just say that
testing out pesticides is it has numerous
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges for the average person or
average grower just to simplify this point
[SPEAKER_02]: though I'm gonna pick something like
lighting for example so let's say we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to compare four different types of
lighting we could throw you know 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_02]: plants under a particular brand of
double-ended HPS lights another one under
[SPEAKER_02]: a particular LED brand and vice versa and
keep them in separate you know in separate
[SPEAKER_02]: tents or separate rooms to where the all
the plants are exactly the same which
[SPEAKER_02]: means we're running the exact same
cultivar we can't compare different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars and then do a yield comparison
at the end because that's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate they need to be cloned plants if
we want to talk about them being
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically identical and of identical
health and identical height and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: know a good scientific experiment would
actually randomize those clones so you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't say oh these five are gonna go
into this you know into this under this
[SPEAKER_02]: light you would actually do a random
number generator and give each plant
[SPEAKER_02]: number and then pull those out that way
and do it to really randomize things as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as possible and then all the you know
everything would be the same across the
[SPEAKER_02]: board and then assuming you've controlled
for all those variables that would at
[SPEAKER_02]: least give you idea that your plants are
gonna yield this particular cultivar we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even make assumptions across a
variety cultivars you know would yield a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount or have this level of
health or this level of growth under this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular light or lighting spectrum and
you know even with a simple example like
[SPEAKER_02]: that it gets challenging because well you
know the double-ended HPS light you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have different heat requirements so
that's gonna change the environment of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room which is gonna have to be accounted
for we can't just assume that all the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms are gonna need the exact same
requirements based on the lighting and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know just trying to pick the simplest of
examples you can find is quite challenging
[SPEAKER_02]: and when we start looking at you know
bottled nutrients or fertilizers we have
[SPEAKER_02]: to know what's in the media already so we
know our starting point and if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: starting from a completely inert media
like Rockwell for example that makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: quite easy but on the organic side that's
not really ideal and so then we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking at you know adding this
product is it actually is it making a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference is everything else the same and
then we you know we have a program that's
[SPEAKER_02]: our you know sort of our control and then
we add product X to a certain number of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and we get this sort of a response
and based on that response and I would go
[SPEAKER_02]: back again and test it again and say okay
well was it this what was the the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling mechanism of action in this
product that made this occur or was it
[SPEAKER_02]: something really specific to this product
was it adding nitrogen phosphorus whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: macro micronutrient and then I would try
another experiment adding just that that
[SPEAKER_02]: micro or macro nutrient to see if I can do
it more affordably or get that same
[SPEAKER_02]: response to know if it really is the
product or really is a particular nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a limiting factor in my grow so it
it's sort of this never-ending fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: sophisticated way of thinking that will
allow you to improve your garden but also
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of get a better idea of how a product
is performing for you right and and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you it's easy I don't want to say
it's easy but you know historically it's
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to find research on let's say I
will call it soil with no microbial or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient activity it like rock wool and to
do nutrient research on that is way easier
[SPEAKER_01]: because as you mentioned all the variables
that go into a living soil because is
[SPEAKER_01]: there a microbe eating another microbe
that processes this other nutrient that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in finding something up and it's so
complex and that's why with the biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: you see way more pesticide trials because
you know here's the leap spray it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: bug dead yes when it comes to biocontrol
it's so complex because you know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have I think a classic example is a road
beetle okay hey you got a road beetle and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know on its normal day at work it's
cruising through the soil and it's like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to eat fungus gnats and oh I like
to eat thrips pupa and you know it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of this weird thing about root aphids
because I've seen people look buckets of
[SPEAKER_01]: them out and they still have massive root
aphids but if you were to take that road
[SPEAKER_01]: beetle and starve it for 24 hours and put
in a petri dish under a you know trial
[SPEAKER_01]: setting and throw some root aphids in
there it will eat it and so what it does
[SPEAKER_01]: in a petri dish these living organisms in
this sterile environment is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what happens out in these
living systems and so that's why some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the research that is done and that's why I
always look to see how it's done you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if if are they given a food choice and you
know if you saw it eating the petri dish
[SPEAKER_01]: does that really mean it's gonna go eat it
out in the wild when it's given all these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things to feed on so again this is
why it's important to understand how the
[SPEAKER_01]: research is actually done not just did it
kill it or not because I've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive I don't know if the words
mistakes but a lot of people using
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we knew weren't going to
work in a growing growers setting even
[SPEAKER_01]: though they got results under a controlled
lab setting so it's a very important to
[SPEAKER_01]: look and see how they've done that
research and even though you know microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't necessarily getting up and walking
away kind of thing they are a living thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that interacts with the environment around
it yeah that brings up a good point and
[SPEAKER_02]: the way I'd like to highlight this point
is actually kind of funny because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of how I met you it was at photo X
and we were talking I don't I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it up but somehow we got on the
topic of compost teas and I know that that
[SPEAKER_02]: was sort of a maybe it still is a little
bit of a trigger for you in some ways
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know there's a lot of claims
being out there out there being made about
[SPEAKER_02]: compost teas that are just frankly not
accurate you know especially things
[SPEAKER_02]: relating to insects and bugs like I
sprayed compost tea and now my soul I you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I did a drench I no longer have
Fusarium or I no longer have pests it
[SPEAKER_02]: repels the pests or makes the plant so
healthy that it's now immune to pests or
[SPEAKER_02]: you know a variety of things and for you I
realized that that is obviously something
[SPEAKER_02]: that would would set you off or you don't
like I don't want to say I'm set off they
[SPEAKER_02]: sound like I'm a crazy lady no no no no I
just I remember when you you met me I
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow you found out that I had something
to do with compost teas and I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: having being we had a longer it actually
was good because it sparked a longer
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation where I got to explain to you
like hey I I agree with a lot of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're saying because compost tea being
you know a microbial product that is so
[SPEAKER_02]: varied every batch is different there
isn't a good way to scientifically control
[SPEAKER_02]: for it and study it so it would be very
hard to get peer-reviewed research and
[SPEAKER_02]: even if we got any I wouldn't trust it
anyway because the batch that I make in my
[SPEAKER_02]: garden is going to be so different than
what that study made that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really carry a lot of weight and to make
claims around it then would be very
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging because every batch is
different and you do have so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different things going on in terms of the
the microbial interactions even using very
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled inputs that to me that kind of
highlights it I definitely don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw you under the bus here I just
thought that was a good example of sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: the diversity and inability to really
control or study something when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about living systems right well and I
think what I get upset about not triggered
[SPEAKER_01]: but upset is because I I it's not that I'm
ever going to say compost tea is a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: thing my issue is is the claims that are
being made it's spray this and you won't
[SPEAKER_01]: have pest issues do this and you won't
have that without anything really to back
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and you know always this question of
well how do you know you're not brewing
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens because same thing with you know
insects it's a matter of opinion if
[SPEAKER_01]: something is good or bad and a compost is
not sentient to sit there and say well
[SPEAKER_01]: today I'm only going to brew the healthy
stuff but I'm going to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all the the plant pathogens in
pathogens die it can't do that I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's definite things you can do you
know controlling your inputs and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: to I would say steer the boat a certain
direction but it's it's this idea of black
[SPEAKER_01]: and white does not exist in in really in a
lot of the stuff we're talking about is so
[SPEAKER_01]: much gray area and the question is is does
the benefit outweigh the risk and the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: that a pesticide a compost tea again is
only going to do amazing things and never
[SPEAKER_01]: do anything bad I mean I would say the
same thing of you know even pesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol agents because even sometimes
biocontrol agents do naughty things you
[SPEAKER_01]: know lace wings they're awesome and they
kick ass but will they feed on other
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials absolutely you know so there's
no absolute in defining this stuff and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that with the compost tea we are
just not there yet in understanding them
[SPEAKER_01]: and for most people I think the risk can
be challenging or the risk is too high
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're going to screw up or get
something wrong in there especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing edible things like
microgreens I mean you get any you know
[SPEAKER_01]: human pathogens in there you know there
goes your whole crop and possibly your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole business I mean you look at the
recalls that happen because of foodborne
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses and I can already hear everybody
saying well that's factory farming but it
[SPEAKER_01]: still can happen I you know you just don't
hear about the smaller issues with it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it I'm not gonna say complexity is
bad I just don't think we're there yet in
[SPEAKER_01]: the understanding and it is not the
miracle cure that I hear so many people
[SPEAKER_01]: you know spouting granted you know is it
hurting the environment to do it no but
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather have people do that than
just dumping out pounds and pounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of synthetic fertilizer not knowing
what they're doing absolutely but my job
[SPEAKER_01]: is to give you know make the growers
successful and you know I just it's you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's inconsistent so so two thoughts
on that one I just want to be clear I have
[SPEAKER_02]: not heard of any any of these outbreaks
being caused specifically by compost tea
[SPEAKER_02]: in regards to that so I just want to just
want to throw that out there so people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't necessarily make that correlation I
think there's that possibility if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: brewed improperly or contains pathogens
but I just you know usually I hear about a
[SPEAKER_02]: you know some sort of you know dairy up
the road that's you know putting out a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of stuff into the end of the water
supply and you know manure and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that and that's where the coli comes from
but who knows wild pigs and bird poop I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean there's and you know they like to you
know workers potentially could spread it
[SPEAKER_01]: too but I've heard some stories about
animals are one and it's stuff you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: control and that's why you know they have
all these falcon ear guys now that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the birds flying around to chase the
little birds out of the field so they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't poop in the field yeah and I just my
last point I want to make on compost tea
[SPEAKER_02]: would be I would argue that you say we're
not there yet I don't know that we will
[SPEAKER_02]: ever be able to understand that level of
complexity or control it I think that just
[SPEAKER_02]: like with our soils I don't think that
that's something that will ever fully
[SPEAKER_02]: understand or fully be able to control
because it is so complex when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about microbiology you know 100
years ago they probably didn't think we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the moon in the 60s so you know just
saying I you know agree to disagree and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what with all the genetic work
that's coming on where you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to do tests to see if
things are present by looking for presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of the DNA we're going to be able to
understand a lot more it's probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in our lifetime but you know I
think we're going to come a lot further
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know I do believe that you know
having all these microbial interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: are really important but again at the end
of the day I got a grower that's got to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a crop by a certain date and if
you know on flower and stuff if those
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't you know in bud ready to bloom like
three days before Mother's Day it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem and so in those kinds of
situations it's just not been consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: enough sure I get that I understand the
desire to control every aspect of the
[SPEAKER_02]: process it certainly makes things easier
in a lot of ways and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges with organics and living soils
and farming in general is there so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are out of our control or
we're letting go of control of when we
[SPEAKER_02]: start using you know utilizing the
microbial loop or nutrient cycling through
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbes or even waiting for your
native beneficials to show up instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying you know sitting there biting
your nails you know when the Oreos going
[SPEAKER_01]: to arrive when the Oreos going to arrive
and waiting for it to happen it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing and you just hope that all
that the Mother Nature's aligns to work
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's supposed to it's nerve-racking
there's no doubt about it but you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: do believe this is the right way we're
going again I am NOT anti compost tea and
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I'll say this again I am NOT a
compost tea specialist so I don't know why
[SPEAKER_01]: you dragged me into these conversations
but I judge I've been around it enough and
[SPEAKER_01]: the claims that again people make these
claims and can't back any of it up well I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I brought it up because I know like
as someone who's worked in that industry
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time and is considered by a lot
of people to be fairly knowledgeable on
[SPEAKER_02]: the topic because that's sort of where I
cut my teeth in the whole you know
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural growing horticulture world
through my father was learning how to use
[SPEAKER_02]: a microscope I'm learning about compost
tea it was kind of where I got thrown in
[SPEAKER_02]: and so meeting you and seeing your
reaction which was actually really common
[SPEAKER_02]: when you talk to people who come from an
academic background it was good to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that conversation and realize that we
actually shared a lot of the same views
[SPEAKER_02]: around around compost teas that was sort
of what I was getting at but there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many snake oil you know thoughts about it
that I totally understood where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from and that's where that product
evaluation I think really comes in right
[SPEAKER_01]: right and I think I mean to be honest
we're on the same page on this except for
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're gonna be in a hundred years
because I think we'll we're gonna learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more and I don't see you out there
saying oh if you spray compost tea you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: never have pest issues again or oh if you
spray compost tea you know your yield will
[SPEAKER_01]: be at times hot you know I don't see you
making those claims you're living with
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the realms of reality not trying
to push a product sure and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay friends with you too so just on the
for the sake of this podcast and not
[SPEAKER_02]: letting it get too long I there were a
couple things I wanted to highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically because what we've been
talking about has been really general in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of evaluating products but it
definitely varies depending on what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about so I wanted to highlight a
few that I'm more familiar with so for
[SPEAKER_02]: example if I was looking at a soil or a
compost the things that I would want
[SPEAKER_02]: specific to those products would be I
would want a chemical analysis I would
[SPEAKER_02]: want a biological analysis again I want to
know what inputs they're using and
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients and creating this product or
process and I'd also want a heavy metal
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis these are all things that a
company should be able to provide you if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be spending money on the
particular product and these are things
[SPEAKER_02]: that I would want to know about anything
I'm bringing into my grow just like
[SPEAKER_02]: testing your water testing your own soil
don't take a company's word for it if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can afford I know this isn't something
everyone can afford to do but if you can
[SPEAKER_02]: afford to do these tests yourself I think
that's really powerful to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: third-party analysis of it too I know I'm
always getting tests back soil tests back
[SPEAKER_02]: from clients that are using our soils and
so I can compare those with our tests and
[SPEAKER_02]: then see you know one what are we putting
out there and how do these different tests
[SPEAKER_02]: from different labs compared to what I
think I'm putting out there and also make
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements or see where something might
have gone wrong it's just it's a good tool
[SPEAKER_02]: to use and knowing that chemical analysis
which is when I say that I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about a soil test or a lab test
when we talk about chemicals that is just
[SPEAKER_02]: telling us the mineral nutrient level is
really important is there anything you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to add on just compost and soil in
terms of evaluating them that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: touch on no because again it's I mean it's
just not my area of specialty again I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I did take composting in college and you
know what's really cool I actually found
[SPEAKER_01]: my one of my agronomy professors from the
University of Florida and I messaged him
[SPEAKER_01]: the other day and he remembers me which is
pretty cool dr. Phil Busey down in Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was kind of nice but I mean again
I just know enough to be dangerous and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of satellite around and you know
I don't consult on any of this I stick to
[SPEAKER_01]: my six and eight legs but I think that the
scientific idea applies to whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: you know whether it be pesticides or bugs
I mean you just have to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific thing and one of the things
that my mom always said to me and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a whole branding thing I need to
do in addition to my tinfoil hat I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say something and my mom would say put
your thinking cap on and does that make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense and I think a lot of times when
somebody makes a claim on a product stop
[SPEAKER_01]: put your little thinking cap on and you
know does it really make sense that this
[SPEAKER_01]: product you know could do all this but not
do that and if it was so amazing why isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world using it that's kind of
what I you know on these thought processes
[SPEAKER_01]: with some of the stuff not to say they
can't be good products but people if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a good product they don't need to
overstate their claims you know I just had
[SPEAKER_02]: that conversation with a girl yesterday
because he was asking me like what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about these pH adjusted water for
pests and I know you and I had touched on
[SPEAKER_02]: it briefly but I just my thing was you
know I haven't tried it but from my
[SPEAKER_02]: experience I why have I not seen this in
greater you know agricultural horticulture
[SPEAKER_02]: world if this is such a wonderful cure for
all pests and diseases I mean with with
[SPEAKER_01]: the giant soybean farmer rather spend you
know three hundred thousand dollars on
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides or adjust his pH of water and
spray his plants where he doesn't need any
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing he doesn't have to buy expensive
pesticides he doesn't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: liability of spray drift he doesn't have
to worry about pesticide resistance if
[SPEAKER_01]: that worked why haven't we been doing this
for years yeah it's not a it's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect answer I mean one could argue that
we're just the technology is just now
[SPEAKER_02]: catching up with or the the research is
catching up with the technology I guess if
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to say that in the right order
but in general I think that's a good just
[SPEAKER_02]: a good guide when we're evaluating a
product touching on another aspect of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing though if we look at bio
stimulants or microbial inputs what sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of things do you look at when you're
looking at those with the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: products the first thing I always want to
know is first of all is it alive because
[SPEAKER_01]: we have had issues with products that are
being sold that are not viable we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing a bunch of products coming to the
market right now that traditionally have
[SPEAKER_01]: been EPA registered pesticides things like
Bavaria and Isaria but people are now
[SPEAKER_01]: producing them and then selling them as
bio stimulants so they can circumvent the
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA registration process and what what's
interesting I've actually been looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: some spore counts that actually come from
the companies and it does these these
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculum products or you know this I guess
inoculum is the best way to call them they
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do have lower spore numbers in
there but you also have to make sure what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're claiming is in there is actually
in there because we did get some products
[SPEAKER_01]: from a grower that had bought one of these
non EPA registered microbial products and
[SPEAKER_01]: there are about 15 different microbial
things in the product after it was plated
[SPEAKER_01]: out and so ideally there should have just
been one thing like if you buy say
[SPEAKER_01]: botanogard WP and you plate it out you're
just going to get a little series of white
[SPEAKER_01]: fuzz balls and it's all going to look
completely uniform and the same but these
[SPEAKER_01]: other products and I'm not saying all soil
inoculum or bio stimulant I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all bad I'm just saying there is
an issue with some of these products and
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's very much a buyer beware and
that's why buying EPA registered products
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a lot of oversight on that
are regularly checked and tested and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's companies that have been around
for decades that are producing them so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good solid companies and when you
contact them and ask do you have any trial
[SPEAKER_01]: data on how this controls that they may
not have it for cannabis but they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a lot of good information for
other crops and can provide that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: support to you but it is it is a very
buyer beware be very serious aware because
[SPEAKER_01]: you just don't know what in these mystery
microbial products yeah it's scary to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be honest I think the EPA will
catch up with some of this stuff because
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them are making pesticidal claims
and you cannot do that on these products
[SPEAKER_02]: because they are not EPA exempt so you're
referencing bio pesticides not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: all microbial inputs that are no making
claims around you know increased nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles plant growth yield phosphorus
solubilization those sorts of things well
[SPEAKER_01]: no no I mean no because again you know
that's my wheelhouse is the six and eight
[SPEAKER_01]: leg things but you know with with things
like trichoderma you know which can help
[SPEAKER_01]: with you know nutrient uptake and disease
management and stuff too yeah I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a product because I've seen that
also sold not EPA registered and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be very important to and it is hard
for a grower to test it you know you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do some quick and easy testing in pre
pre-filled petri dishes that you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: an Amazon but all that's going to tell you
is if the product is viable but you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be very careful because not all
microbial products will grow on the media
[SPEAKER_01]: in these petri dishes I think mycorrhizae
is a really good example because you just
[SPEAKER_01]: can't plate up mycorrhizae and expect it
to grow because I I've I'm I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous enough on mycorrhizae and I've
been trying to understand it more and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I did ask several of the companies
how do you test for viability because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's concerns on are the products
actually alive when you get them and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was amazing to me how many people couldn't
answer from my from mycorrhizae companies
[SPEAKER_01]: how you actually test mycorrhizae to see
if it's alive and that's kind of a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a red flag for me and I'm not
saying all products are bad but I just
[SPEAKER_01]: think that you know if you look at
products that have a long track record
[SPEAKER_01]: that are being used across multiple
industries that might be a little better
[SPEAKER_01]: than something that's a smaller company
that's just been cannabis focused yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: think microbial inputs are tricky for sure
so you mentioned viability you know how do
[SPEAKER_02]: we know that they're even viable how do we
know that what's in the bag matches what's
[SPEAKER_02]: on the label because technically to make
it on that label they just have to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: one test that shows those levels as a
guaranteed analysis from the lab to
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the registration registering
agency is but stuff isn't even registered
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff that we picked up from what the
one grower they bought it at a trade show
[SPEAKER_01]: like from under the table and it didn't
even have there was no EPA register there
[SPEAKER_01]: was nothing on it just here here's the
rate and a date and that was it well I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't buy that but but the problem is
the grower didn't understand that this was
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem you know that's that's until you
realize this they thought that was fine to
[SPEAKER_01]: use and they don't understand the risk
involved with doing stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just coming from Iowa you know
not understanding regulatory stuff and and
[SPEAKER_01]: risk is you know it's not the growers
fault they're trying to do the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just it's a really tough
situation right now with all of that well
[SPEAKER_02]: we are seeing some testing coming out of
the Oregon Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been doing it for a number of
years now and they share that testing now
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not all the manufacturers agree
with that testing is a whole nother whole
[SPEAKER_02]: nother podcast altogether but there is
some testing available so you can go on
[SPEAKER_02]: their website and and see what results
they got and some products test quite well
[SPEAKER_02]: other products test quite differently than
what they are purportedly on the label
[SPEAKER_02]: itself but when we're looking at these
microbial products I think we have at
[SPEAKER_02]: least for me if I was going to trial one
what I would do or what we've done in
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities is look at okay we're going to
apply this particular microbial product
[SPEAKER_02]: just to these beds here or these plants
and see and keep those plants separate out
[SPEAKER_02]: so that when we go to we go to harvest we
can see if our yield increased overall and
[SPEAKER_02]: if we can say that you know product X
microbial product increased our yield in
[SPEAKER_02]: this facility by 10% then it would be
worth applying because it's you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: high value crop it would be worth using
that product now do we know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism action was do we know that every
bottle is viable the answer be no to all
[SPEAKER_02]: that but we can we can at least apply some
level of control or testing or trialing
[SPEAKER_02]: before just applying a product you know
willy-nilly across an entire entire grow I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess I agree with you a hundred percent
the only thing that I'm kind of curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about I noticed because so and I'm not
picking on metarysium but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: metarysium I'm sorry mycorrhizae you know
there was a big push into the ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse about 10 12 years ago for
mycorrhizae you know for you know to use
[SPEAKER_01]: it on everything and all the growers
jumped in but you know my question is if
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycorrhizae is so good why do you have
other things like cytokinins and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're mixed in with the product and how
do you know what is actually providing the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit to the plant so I get a little
weary if there's too many things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: product I mean if it's you know it should
be able to just be the product you need
[SPEAKER_01]: and not the other things around it because
I wonder sometimes with those tests it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a cytokinins given that little push in the
plant because the more I'm understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: about how long it takes for you know
mycorrhizae to really establish if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the right species and all that you
know the ornamental crops have too fast of
[SPEAKER_01]: a turnaround time you know because the
ornamental crops are usually you know out
[SPEAKER_01]: real fast and so you know that's what
makes me think it was actually maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokinins doing the work and not
necessarily the mycorrhizae having time to
[SPEAKER_02]: get established in the crop yeah I want to
come back to mycorrhizae but one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: before or mycorrhizal fungus but before I
do the one thing I want to mention too is
[SPEAKER_02]: also microbial persistence and this idea
is like how long are these microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: staying alive in the soil after we apply
them do we have to apply them every two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks do we apply them once and never have
to worry about again now when we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about mycorrhizal fungus and it's
interesting because mycorrhizae is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually that relationship between the
fungus and the root so there's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a nomenclature distinction here but
and I know just and I know just a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more to be slightly more dangerous
than you on this but when we talk you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned species and we talked about that
well there's products out there that you
[SPEAKER_02]: go to read the label you know you're
trying to do the right thing and you read
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you're like oh my gosh this has 1.2
million spores of you know mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: spores in there and then but then when you
look a little closer you see that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: you know for example if we're growing
cannabis and they have high levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: ectomycorrhizal spores well that forms a
relationship with conifers that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do us any good in terms of
getting mycorrhizal infection of our
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant so you know if I'm if I'm
looking growing you know blueberries or
[SPEAKER_02]: azaleas or tomatoes those those are going
to be very different mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships and so I have to make sure
I'm getting the right you know mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: species and then just to complicate things
they keep changing names so you'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: glomis interatuses which is now you know
glomis irregularis which got changed out
[SPEAKER_02]: the glomis family all together so became I
believe rhizophagus irregularis so it just
[SPEAKER_02]: gets really really confusing because you
could find any of those names on a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular label it's all the same species
essentially of a fungus now one other
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to consider there when we're talking
about this is you mentioned multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: products in there so you'll see let's say
that product had you know 1.2 million
[SPEAKER_02]: spores of ectomycorrhizal fungus what may
have a hundred spores per cc of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: the right glomis endo mycorrhizal species
for the plant that we're growing in this
[SPEAKER_02]: case cannabis but then it may have three
million spores of trichoderma in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: like you mentioned well shoot when we have
that much of a difference in the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: spores in a product how do we know that it
isn't the trichoderma that's making a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference trichoderma is you know cheap
relative to mycorrhizal fungus why are we
[SPEAKER_02]: spending all this money at the at the very
least we're spending too much money or
[SPEAKER_02]: we're you know we're applying the product
wrong you know if we just apply the
[SPEAKER_02]: product over the top and it's not coming
in direct contact with the roots now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting our money as well so there's just
so many of these variables like you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned that are that are really
important with microbials that I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to we have to really consider right
yeah and again this is something that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the reality we know nothing about really
what's happening not for hundreds of years
[SPEAKER_01]: will we understand more but there is some
initial work going on right now looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the bacillus's and trichodermas
and how they perform differently in
[SPEAKER_01]: different media types because basically
they do the they they perform different in
[SPEAKER_01]: different medias to leave it at that and
that's why again why you may see a
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher do a project you do a trial
with a product and get great results and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't see that out in your
facility it could have to do your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: types are different enough that the
microbials are acting different and by the
[SPEAKER_01]: way while we were sitting here I googled
real quick what you know plants with non
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal associations apparently 29% of
all vascular plants are non hosts for
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae so 30% of plants aren't hosts
I thought it was like 90 some percent of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants had some some level of mycorrhizal
relationship notably for those of us that
[SPEAKER_02]: grow vegetables anything in the brassica
family is non mycorrhizal so we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be applying it to our kale or our
broccoli for those of us that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae in our garden yeah well and
you know from when you say garden do you
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like vegetable garden or garden
garden yeah I'm sorry vegetable garden
[SPEAKER_01]: when I say garden and you know I do
massive tons of vegetable gardening here
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know what it's Pennsylvania you
look at the soil and it grows here so I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do I mean in my seedlings I add
trichoderma just to you know prevent a
[SPEAKER_01]: little damping off but other than that I
mean my soil is so rich here I mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes volunteer each year from the
previous year it's pretty nuts and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you add in you know getting those 11
inches of rain in 48 hours you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: good on water for a while now over here
that's great that's great well I
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate your time today and talking
about this topic I just I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: caution listeners you know when
considering whatever product that they may
[SPEAKER_02]: be using in their garden make sure that
they're doing this sort of thought process
[SPEAKER_02]: or level of evaluation because at the very
at the very very least they could probably
[SPEAKER_02]: save some money even if the product itself
works there may be more effective ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the same result using something that
might be more affordable or using less of
[SPEAKER_02]: a product so you can always be testing
things to improve your process I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: right and and I mean I agree with
everything you've been saying Tad that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I like you so much and I just I you
can't I mean yes there's a lot to be said
[SPEAKER_01]: for talking to other people that have done
other stuff and I guess word of mouth is a
[SPEAKER_01]: starting point but I think it's always
good to check the products yourself and do
[SPEAKER_01]: your homework on your products and you
know I had a grower comment back to me
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know well they're too busy to
check on details and facts on these things
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like how can you not be because I
mean this is your livelihood or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing this as a hobby is it something
you're ingesting I mean do your homework
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure that what you're doing is
you know safe for you safe for the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and you're not wasting money I
mean that's the you know the one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: big things there I do see a lot of money
spent that's not needed I do fully believe
[SPEAKER_01]: in microbial stuff I think with pest
management we're gonna see a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial pest management products coming
I mean I already am pretty excited that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have you know several registered strains
of a very bossiana here in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States to use and so again the big guys
are getting more involved with the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials and so they can afford more
research so we'll get more information on
[SPEAKER_01]: it just be smart and you know again when
you're thinking cap my mom will be proud
[SPEAKER_02]: of you if you do thanks Suzanne and oh man
I want to sign off there but I really have
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask you this question with microbials
are you seeing resistance from insects
[SPEAKER_02]: like you might with traditional
chemistries or is that not a problem the
[SPEAKER_01]: same with other like you know predatory
insects so when I went and I took that
[SPEAKER_01]: insect pathology course at Cornell and it
was taught by the top insect pathologists
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world it was amazing I mean I was
fangirling the whole time about these
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers I asked that exact question
and they said they have never seen it is
[SPEAKER_01]: it possible yes anything's impossible I
mean anything's possible but it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: something we're worried about I have an
ornamental greenhouse that we rely heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: on biocontrol and we fog in a cold fogger
which by the way I've recently learned
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growers don't know what cold
foggers are so you know go Google cold
[SPEAKER_01]: foggers people and learn about them
ornamental growers use them all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: but they cold fog but very yet once a week
and they've been doing it for years and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have not had any resistance issues with it
cool all right well we'll end on that note
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think that's a really
interesting point that I wasn't aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: either so thank you for your time today
Suzanne I look forward to talking to you
[SPEAKER_01]: again soon anytime I'm always here for you
Tad all right have a wonderful rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your day thank you too that
