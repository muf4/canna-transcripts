[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Cad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to warn listeners that today's
podcast is not about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some great guests lined up soon
for more interviews on growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but today I want to discuss another
important topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone growing cannabis as a business
or working in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that having a great product or
growing top shelf cannabis is only half
[SPEAKER_01]: the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other half is shaping your message in
a way to effectively reach your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, I had the pleasure today of
interviewing my good friend, Shango Lohse,
[SPEAKER_01]: who has had his feet in both the marketing
and cannabis world for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango is the founder of Shaping Fire and
the host of the Shaping Fire Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't had a chance to check it
out, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: His YouTube channel features exclusive
how-to videos and expert interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango is also the founder of Vimeo,
the medical cannabis entrepreneur trade
[SPEAKER_01]: group on Vashon Island here in Washington
state, where he lives, that is now
[SPEAKER_01]: involved into a patient outreach and
educational organization, hosting some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the top cannabis speakers in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to put myself in that category,
but I did have the honor of speaking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Vimeo event and that video on living
soil homegrown cannabis can be seen on his
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango has been working in brand strategy
and marketing for 25 years and since 2013
[SPEAKER_01]: has been helping cannabis entrepreneurs
bring their products to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of fun to have the
tables, the microphones turned because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been on my Shaping Fire Podcast a
couple of times, but now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has got some different flavor for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you and I have talked off air quite
a bit and I know you have such a wealth of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience from your previous careers and
also everything you've done in and around
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited that we'll get the
opportunity to interview you and share
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this marketing and branding
information with our listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little different than your
other shows too, because I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy listening to your podcast and you
know, it's all very, very scientific and
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea that we're going to kind of plug
in some marketing information for people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are bringing some kind of
cannabis related product to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's going to be a fun little
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to start off by giving
listeners a little bit of background into
[SPEAKER_01]: who you are and what you're all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the two important things about
my background that would inform our
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion today would be number one,
I've been doing brand strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and what we used to call back in
the day in the dot com boom product
[SPEAKER_00]: evangelism, you know, for over 20 years or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lucky enough, you know,
I did the first dot com boom and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that chaos and investment capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to live that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time people always said,
oh my gosh, to be alive and to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneur when a whole new industry
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a once in a lifetime thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was in my early twenties and I
was making more money than I ever had in
[SPEAKER_00]: my life right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing is that once in a
lifetime experience I'm having again now
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very grateful to be alive in
this time and to be able to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but back in the dot com age,
or the first boom, we were doing lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: tech related stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing a lot of brand building
and destroying a lot of companies and then
[SPEAKER_00]: building some that survived too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what we're talking about
today, I think the most relevance is since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, I've been helping cannabis related
companies bring their products to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started with, I founded this
organization here on Vashon Island where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live that brought together all the medical
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was pre taxation and normalization
here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were getting together and I
live on this island and the farmers were
[SPEAKER_00]: just competing against each other,
selling against each other on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had very low prices for very
high quality flour and value added
[SPEAKER_00]: products like RSO and edibles and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I kind of realized what was going
on, I'm like, oh my gosh, all you farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: could make so much more money if we got
the product off the island, if we got it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dispensaries in other parts of
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it was legal enough,
I started this group called Vimea,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Vashon Island Marijuana Entrepreneurs
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the word marijuana is not
really, people don't embrace that as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2013, I didn't understand that
cannabis was going to be our preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I pulled together all the
farmers and I said, listen, I can help
[SPEAKER_00]: build these relationships with the
dispensaries over town off the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we all work together,
we can do things like buy soil in bulk and
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil nutrients in bulk and
packaging in bulk to bring everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: costs down and then to bring your profit
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they were all like into this
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really where I got my start
bringing my, the brand strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and operational stuff that I had
been doing in tech into cannabis because I
[SPEAKER_00]: myself am a cannabis patient, had a
traumatic brain injury and then started
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching what I knew to people here on the
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after helping the growers on the
island kind of set up this distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: network through the Washington Medical
System, people started asking me for help
[SPEAKER_00]: with different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soil nutrient or a specialty value added
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just been continuing on now
for five years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must admit I'm kind of moving away from
the consulting while I'm still available
[SPEAKER_00]: for like products that I think are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the shaping fire podcast is taken
off so much and I'm traveling a lot to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that and to interview people and to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing nearly as much consulting
I'm doing, but it doesn't mean that my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain doesn't think about it all the time
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I have had a lot of discussions
about marketing and you've actually helped
[SPEAKER_01]: me with considering how to position or
look at another podcast that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at starting and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've really appreciated your knowledge
and your perspective on things throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we know a little bit about you
and I have to say like if you meet Chang
[SPEAKER_01]: on person, you would never picture that he
was this like tech guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he he you feel to me like
someone who's been around cannabis your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Vashon Island is just such this
amazing place for artists and and people
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to kind of get away from sort of
city life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be pretty close to the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a cool experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people ever get a chance to make it out
there, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really I'm really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, it was my brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brought me to Vashon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to live in Seattle proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my after my brain injury, my
neurologist said, you know, if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to heal properly, yeah, use the
cannabis medicine, but also you should
[SPEAKER_00]: move out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I moved here to Vashon in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though I only started
really being involved with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business in 2013, I mean, I've been
talking since since college.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's like 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1989, I got turned on to smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been in cannabis culture and I'm a
deadhead, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I followed the Grateful Dead for
a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I still I still listen to
them weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm an old head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of funny, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, this this year, I've let my hair
grow again, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning of this more formalized
version of cannabis that we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into a lot of the early people,
they, you know, they wanted to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: people in suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to trust their millions
of dollars to somebody who didn't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like who they were familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started in cannabis,
you know, I had my hair a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I would speak at conventions,
I would wear a suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a couple of years of that,
I realized that the kind of people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted in my suit was was different
than the people I wanted to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, ah, hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just let my hair grow long and feral
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wear my normal clothes and
everything's still fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still making money and people still
want to hear my my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just decided that wearing a suit was
a was a not not an important variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that talks a little about your own
personal brand and how you wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: position yourself in the market and be
perceived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's right on topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's let's go and dive in a little
bit now about some of the things you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about in terms of branding and
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted you to be able to give a little
bit of a foundation for, say, growers or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who had a product that was coming
out in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you give us a little bit of a
foundation around best practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that would go on the marketing
side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I'll take a little module out of a
out of a class that I teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also where I start with all of
my consulting clients just to put us on
[SPEAKER_00]: the on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go through five categories of of
brand strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll call it that should be
considered both by by folks who are are
[SPEAKER_00]: launching a farm or something that's going
to produce cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this also works just as well for a non
regulated product, whether it be bongs and
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes and rolling papers or like living
soil nutrition or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's five categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is going to be naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people they've got the name that
they've been calling their project in
[SPEAKER_00]: their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of like a default that
that's what the name of the business is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some really important things
to think about when choosing a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you want to make sure that
it's unique in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that there's not
already somebody doing that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you want to pick something that is
has got some kind of unique word in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it's easily searchable.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if that's why we get a lot of
these these companies called like Purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Penguin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't usually get the word
purple and the word penguin next to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody Google's Purple Penguin,
they come right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to call your company,
let's say Green Rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common terms used in
cannabis media right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you put in Green Rush
Company, they're not going to find your
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be all of these news
articles about the Green Rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I encourage my my my clients to to
do a little brainstorming to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's unique, that catches the
spirit of how they want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and you know, in the old days,
we would do like a whole half day
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorming workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most folks don't have time or
resources to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I just recommend this this quick
little exercise to get you going,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to to brainstorm 50 descriptive
words for what you do or sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and when you get to probably,
you know, somewhere between eight and
[SPEAKER_00]: twelve, it's going to start getting hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and don't give up then because
it's when your brain is searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: other words that don't come to mind
quickly that you actually stumble across
[SPEAKER_00]: really good names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to you want to press your
mind you want to make your mind really
[SPEAKER_00]: work for these words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so the first time through,
you brainstorm 50 descriptive words for
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do or sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then the second part of it is
that you brainstorm another 50 words that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like your customers to use to
describe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got two columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: One column is all about, you know,
what you do, what you're selling or what
[SPEAKER_00]: your service is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is descriptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could just play with that and
massage those words back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and start to find, well, what jumps
out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What excites you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What combinations of words do you think
are cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you've pushed your mind twice,
you're going to have a lot of unexpected
[SPEAKER_00]: words that that came to you after you've
done your first, you know, 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chances are you're going to find a lot
of really interesting, unexpected highways
[SPEAKER_00]: to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then with all of those
resources you have made mix and match them
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and until you have at least five
acceptable names, right, five names that
[SPEAKER_00]: you think, OK, I could I could live with
this name for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just stick with the first one,
because just because you've gotten one
[SPEAKER_00]: name that is acceptable, you know,
the next one may actually be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be you're going to
have this name for a lot of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you you pick
a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your brainstorming exercise,
mix and match the words, make at least
[SPEAKER_00]: five acceptable names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go to category two,
which is social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you've got a name for yourself
or at least a proposed list of five names,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to really check your social media
because it is going to be forever a pain
[SPEAKER_00]: in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if someone else has already got the
social media handles that are the name of
[SPEAKER_00]: your company, you'll find that you're
you're having to do like an underscore in
[SPEAKER_00]: between them or do a weird spelling or,
man, all that stuff really degrades your
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after you've got your list of five
acceptable names, number one, go and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you can get the domain domain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go make sure you can get the dot com for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go check Instagram and Facebook and
Twitter and make sure that you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: your name the same in all of those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why this is so important is because,
you know, not only you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell your customers where to go very
easily, but when you start printing up
[SPEAKER_00]: flyers and printed materials, it takes up
a lot of space to list four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: different social media locations for
yourself because you're this on IG,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're this different thing on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a different domain
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets really confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important enough to pick a unique
name that is unique enough that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it up in all of your social media
uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if someone is sitting on a
name that you want to use, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, you know, on Twitter or
something, I mean, domain names are are
[SPEAKER_00]: much more regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you can't really grab somebody's
domain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Twitter, for example, I was
working with Gangepreneur.com and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: had been sitting on the Twitter handle
Gangepreneur, but they hadn't posted
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on their behalf, I wrote to Twitter
and I said, hey, you know, this is this is
[SPEAKER_00]: our legitimate business name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cat has got this this Twitter
account that says Gangepreneur,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he doesn't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hasn't for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about you consider taking it from
him and giving it to us since it's our
[SPEAKER_00]: official business name, Twitter people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so I was able to, you know,
capture that for Gangepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so if you've got a company and and and
you can get the domain name and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a couple of the social medias,
but you can't get one of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: know that it is a possibility that you
could reach out to them and and and claim
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got this business and could
potentially grab that that social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is active on it, that's
probably way less likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's neglected, it makes it makes
it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the second category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one is naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just wanted to jump in a little
bit about naming because I think that's so
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people undervalue it as as
exactly how much of a priority it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that when we first started
my business or I came into my parents'
[SPEAKER_01]: business, it was a compost tea brewing
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our name was Simplicity, but it was
Dash Te A, which from a dot com
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective is really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people had trouble finding the website
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents didn't know anything about
tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was back in 2000 when dot
coms weren't even really a thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it became a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I've looked into naming future
businesses and ideas and products and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, I've had the opportunity
to meet with some really, really amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the marketing side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that they've they've
taught me is sort of take the values that
[SPEAKER_01]: are associated with your product,
whatever your product is, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or cannabis related fertilizer or
something, and figure out what those
[SPEAKER_01]: values are and then figure out how you can
convey them to that audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it by making a word
association, like creating association
[SPEAKER_01]: like Apple, for example, or Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no association with the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We they created that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you hear the word Apple,
you think of, you know, these technology
[SPEAKER_01]: and an iPhone and and with Amazon,
you think of an online an online store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were able to create that
association out of nowhere through
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try and use the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the stuff by Jonah Berger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever read Contagious?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this awesome book you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a link on the podcast page for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of YouTube talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things he talks about was
he actually came up with the name Swiffer,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was, you know, they had this mop
thing for cleaning dust off of floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were like, what kind of words
sound like?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear the word Swiffer,
what do you think of?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think, well, it sounds like Swift,
so it sounds fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that fuss sound in the middle,
which sort of makes you think of like
[SPEAKER_01]: moving a mop along the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used a made up word that already
had associations that you weren't even
[SPEAKER_01]: really aware of in your brain around this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did the same thing with Febreze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought that was really
interesting way of approaching naming that
[SPEAKER_01]: was really successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love any kind of a name where you
can get on a monopoeia like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the name sounds like the service or
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives an extra set of character to your
company and people can put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two other things to hit on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That idea of making a name like Apple that
doesn't mean anything in technology until
[SPEAKER_00]: you make it say that, that goes for the
same with my podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that doesn't really mean anything
to most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once people become aware of both the
Shaping Fire podcast and our popular
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel, then people are like,
oh yeah, I know what Shaping Fire is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have imbued that instilled meaning
into Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What nobody knows though is that when I
was coming up with it, I actually did the
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorming exercises that I had just
been just talking about and more,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My naming process took about eight weeks
and I came up with about 10 names in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end that I liked and it was finally
Shaping Fire that I stopped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, Shaping Fire, the name has
always been about, there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: normalization, legalization, taxation
thing that's taking off and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has now become this wildfire and
it's chaotic and it's both creating and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through good, quality education,
which I aim to provide both on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the YouTube channel, we are shaping
this fire and we're sculpting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, so that's where I came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing you were talking about
too, you said simplicity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're taking a word simplicity
that is in the dictionary and replacing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that it's like a homonym
like simplicity, T-E-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I generally suggest people avoid those
because they're easy for people to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find you when they search for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my good friends did that recently
and he jokes about it all the time when he
[SPEAKER_00]: does interviews, Patrick from Green
Bicycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts together a great compost tea and
soil amendments, but Green Bicycles is
[SPEAKER_00]: G-R-E-A-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a decision he made early
on in his process and he's gone with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always jokes about how it's a
hassle now to always have to explain to
[SPEAKER_00]: people that green is not the color green,
it's this G-R-E-A-N, even though all of
[SPEAKER_00]: his marketing really uses the color green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I caution people to really focus on
words that when people hear it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will understand how to spell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is when I heard shaping
fire, well, one thing I love about that is
[SPEAKER_01]: if you type shaping fire into Google,
they're going to find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very intentional and very easy to
spell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can spell the word shaping and
the word fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not challenging for someone to spell
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was because I was seeing
on Instagram, everyone, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when someone puts up a good bud or flower
picture, people would use the fire emoji
[SPEAKER_01]: or say it was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you were using that sort of
slang term that had become popular in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis culture as a way of saying like
shaping fire, like growing top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, which is interesting because up
until now, I didn't realize you had a
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different meaning around your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly wasn't lost on me when I
chose the name that it had these multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: meanings in our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a fire is a word that people in our
scene, you know, embrace readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good descriptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I wouldn't have called the
show like, you know, shaping larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would having it come together
like that was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, what was not the initial intent
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were you were on social media,
I think, when I interrupted you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we did naming and we did social
media because we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your your your company is set up to win
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I always recommend people to
trademark early.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you've decided what your name
is really going to be, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately trademark as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you if you are a farm and you are
selling cannabis, the USPTO will not give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a trademark for selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still waiting on that to be legally
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But perhaps you could you could start your
trademark by trademarking your name and
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability to make t shirts with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your ability to consult with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start building up this legal
history of relationship of you and that
[SPEAKER_00]: name and and that you're using it
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are in the cannabis industry,
but you're in a non regulated product,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, for example, you know, bongs and
rolling papers or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: something something that's not regulated
by the state, then you can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you should do that right away
because there's never been so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: starting cannabis related companies as
there are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chance that, you know,
if your company is in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody else in Connecticut is going
to come up with the same idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very likely, especially since the
lexicon of cannabis words is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you if you're a
technical kind of person, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly you can file your trademark on
your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm I'm a big fan of having legal
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can you can get into a
trademark attorney, you know, for as
[SPEAKER_00]: little as probably eight hundred bucks to
be able to get your initial trademark
[SPEAKER_00]: placed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's on the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking this game seriously,
spending eight hundred bucks on a
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark should be probably be considered
a reasonable expense to protect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your company's identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yeah, so that's that's a that's a
short area trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but do it swiftly as soon as you have
decided on a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the next category is is what I
call thin slicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and for for for folks who are
listening and who have grown up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet, this will be like a duh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for but there was a time before the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were going to open a company,
you normally had a storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for most companies,
I mean, unless you're you're opening a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail shop, right, when so that the whole
point is having a storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of Internet only companies
because you don't have to pay the overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: for retail space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay the overhead for the
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to deal with municipal bans
on cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you get to take advantage of
what's called thin slicing, because in
[SPEAKER_00]: your you know, let's say that you live in
a small town somewhere and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: you've come up with this really cool
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may only be a couple hundred to a
couple thousand people in your immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: area of driving distance who will drive to
your store and buy whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're selling it on the Internet
and now everyone is pretty comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with e-commerce and putting their credit
cards online and all that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to thin slice the entirety of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas locally, there might only be a few
people who want your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the entire country,
there's plenty of people to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: company in float and doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of those folks who I
think has done a good job of it is Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: Atkinson at Grokashi, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan does not do a lot of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't do a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything, his biggest marketing is
probably being the co-founder of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Probiotic Farmers Alliance and his
leadership there tends to lead people to
[SPEAKER_00]: his product, Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is that there are enough
people across the country that hear his
[SPEAKER_00]: message about Grokashi and then can buy it
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way more people than there are in
Laytonville, even though that's a hotbed
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis growing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly not belittling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of cannabis being grown
there, but there's only so many people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Laytonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that he's able to thin slice this
national market and sell to all those
[SPEAKER_00]: people, he gets to access a nationwide
consumer pool without having to have
[SPEAKER_00]: retail shops all across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works out really well to his
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consider thin slicing and being an
internet company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're thinking about opening a
retail store, make sure you are clear in
[SPEAKER_00]: your head that your business model demands
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then similarly, and then this is the
last of the five categories, is start
[SPEAKER_00]: using tech marketing as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, right away, as soon as even
you have a placeholder on your website
[SPEAKER_00]: before you've even launched, make sure you
integrate some kind of like MailChimp
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter to capture emails because
sometimes people come to your website
[SPEAKER_00]: once, but they won't ever come again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they come once, it's shown
enough interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're willing to give you their
email address, now you can reach them
[SPEAKER_00]: again when you actually go through your
product launch and any future product
[SPEAKER_00]: launches, and you can start to develop a
relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So capturing emails with MailChimp,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start building customer
loyalty programs based on your newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: and creating original content for that
newsletter that causes people to share it
[SPEAKER_00]: with their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all very low priced marketing
that is very valuable when you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out before you're actually
creating revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some other really good
high quality tech marketing tools out
[SPEAKER_00]: there like the Facebook Pixel,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the greatest tools that
we've got for marketing in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though Instagram and Facebook make it
difficult to market cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: products, if you take your time and you
massage your messaging and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of cannabis in your ad,
you can actually make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you boost those and your return
on that kind of marketing is really good
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take the time to write it in a way
that you can kind of disco around their
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you can use what's called a
Facebook Pixel and it tracks everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: clicks on your ad and go to your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can remarket to them later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not familiar with the
Facebook Pixel, you should look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all sorts of different
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites is actually called Hot
Jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tracks the movement of people on your
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that you've got an online
store and you're not getting the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: sales that you want for the amount of
people who are coming to your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that you have a high bounce
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come, but they don't buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it would sure be great to know what
they're doing on your website while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're getting lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't understand how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this service called Hot Jar
actually records, video records,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who comes to your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever you want to, you can log
in and watch each user's session and track
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a heat map for the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may find out that people are
confusing your catalog with your shopping
[SPEAKER_00]: cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they're coming to their website
and you're expecting them to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: store part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe they're going and getting
distracted by your blog and your videos
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're spending all their time there
and they're forgetting to go back to the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hot Jar is another great technology
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often it's worth it to bring on an
expert at this point, because if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, chances are you're focused on
the operations and horticulture of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are manufacturing or curating
products for sale, that's probably where
[SPEAKER_00]: your expertise is and you're working on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, myself even, I know that
my tech marketing has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what I enjoy most is reaching
out to industry experts and then chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and then going to conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might want to add somebody
who's a specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I hired Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I work with Kirsten Nelson at Blunt
Branding to sculpt my message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, this is what I want to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how I want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she'll take it and plug it into
all this kind of, the technology and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook pixel, she'll deploy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can just go back to doing the
things that I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, bringing somebody on like
that, you want to make sure you negotiate
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you can afford dollar-wise,
but the amount of time that it frees you
[SPEAKER_00]: up is really helpful, especially if you
don't know how this technology crap works
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is not your bread and butter,
you're going to spend so much time
[SPEAKER_00]: learning the technology that you might as
well get somebody at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the five categories that I
always start with my clients to brainstorm
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a name, make sure it's available
throughout social media and domain,
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark it as soon as you can,
lean towards a thin slicing internet
[SPEAKER_00]: company with less overhead, and start
using technology marketing apps as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so that you can track and get
into relationships with the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with everything you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you had some company
examples to sort of highlight some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to touch on some of that right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you already mentioned green
bicycles for the naming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there some other things that you had
in mind in that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as that goes, I mean,
there's some folks that do it really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: like our mutual friend, Jeremy Silva,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over at Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a great job about this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's got a unique name that's
really easy to say, really easy to spell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does, you know, he's creating new
content on Instagram all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I can't be the only one
who loves watching him grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does like A-B testing with different
growing supplies in two four by four tents
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in his shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's creating original
content and and people know him as a
[SPEAKER_00]: human.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they also know his company as
curating good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he's one person that
does it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about Jeremy for a second?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a few things I want to
highlight that that I thought he did a
[SPEAKER_01]: great job on, too, is I met Jeremy
digitally in the ICMAG forum for organic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I had I had founded or
started Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build A Soil was wasn't even around yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were selling these amendments
online, but I was not doing any marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day, a banner ad for Build A
Soil showed up on the ICMAG forum for
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soil, and he was sponsoring that
forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, you know, people started
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably didn't pay that much for the
banner in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was he was really a marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he did was he built this idea
around amendments by taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: information he was learning on ICMAG and
putting it on his website in the blog and
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing the things that people like
Clackamascoot were saying and sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: these recipes and just simplifying the
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he did was say, hey, I'm going to
give you all this information for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these these products that
this information talks about are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be available on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I think Jeremy
did a great job of was he focused on one
[SPEAKER_01]: social media platform and that has been
very consistent with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 20 or 30 thousand followers now
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he's done there is he's been very
consistent about his posting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I am terrible at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rather than him diluting his time by
posting on Facebook and Instagram or these
[SPEAKER_01]: other markets, he's picked the one that he
thought was most relevant to growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then has really stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, sharing all that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's also created this sort of
lifestyle brand around him and his company
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's not all of his posts are not
about just about cannabis or about
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot of stuff that he puts
up about his products and deals and that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also talks about his girlfriend's
hip surgery and the martial arts that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and his his pet pig and other things
in his life that make you feel a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more connected to the person and the
business that you're you're contributing
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole build of soil brand just
screams authenticity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's the kind of guy when you run
into him at Emerald Cup or or locally
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Colorado, you're you're happy to
run into him not because he's a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: business owner necessarily, but just
because he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I got to say that probably
applies equally to you, Tad, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you run a similar type business
and and you also provide a lot of value
[SPEAKER_00]: through your podcast, which then drives
traffic to the Keep It Simple website
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are able to provide these these
amendments as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say also you are also a
likable guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would I would say that the idea
of of, you know, not being plasticky
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate and instead kind of like letting
that veil between your business and your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal life be a little bit transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that creates customer loyalty
because, you know, there's a reason why we
[SPEAKER_00]: all push back against like, you know,
behemoths with no personality like Miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's it's a bunch of C-suite
executives behind it and not some person
[SPEAKER_00]: who, you know, we'd want to sit down and
talk with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like we both agree that that
Jeremy's done a really good job of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to highlight, too,
something that was really tough for me
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first got into business or having a
product in a market was I spent a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time noticing other competitors,
things they were doing right, things they
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing wrong, information that they
were sharing that was just blatantly
[SPEAKER_01]: inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would get really angry and I get
caught up focusing more on them and their
[SPEAKER_01]: product than what I was doing with my own
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was totally the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, I've really learned that a lot
of times you can collaborate with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And realistically, it's important to be
aware of what other people are doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: your industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't it doesn't and shouldn't be
the focus of your time and your energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jeremy is probably my biggest online
competitor when it comes to selling
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking about him on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm also,
you know, I've established a good working
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with Jeremy, even though
we've never met in person, but we've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked on the phone a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we get along great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish him the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping I can collaborate with him
in the future because we can only become
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger through these partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be this antagonistic
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like you mentioned,
green bicycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we start as a compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost tea is still a big part of our
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet I realize there's other people out
there that may be doing as good or better
[SPEAKER_01]: job as well in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's I think it's one of those things
we just need to recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that we don't have to focus on what
other people are doing, but really focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on what we're doing and find ways to
collaborate with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you make two really solid
points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one about watching what
everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people doing so many
businesses and they do it in competitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: combative ways that I would find that I
find frustrating and antagonizing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: find when when I focus on what everybody
else is doing in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so upset and stressed out that I
have a hard time taking care of my own
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and similarly, I want to do my podcast
and my YouTube channel in my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are often talking to me
like, hey, did you, you know, listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular podcast or this particular
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are often surprised when I say,
you know, I only really listen to like
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four podcasts, you know,
and there there's probably easily 30 that
[SPEAKER_00]: are popular in in in cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't listen to them all because
mostly I'm focused on keeping my head
[SPEAKER_00]: down, taking care of my own business and
doing my things the way that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of feeling like I need to know
what what everybody else is doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because normally I don't want to replicate
what anybody else is doing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do things in my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I think that's a really
good point that you have to don't worry
[SPEAKER_00]: what everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to if you want to drop in
and follow somebody for a little while so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can learn, you know, some of
their secrets and then you can cross apply
[SPEAKER_00]: those secrets to how you're doing
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, you know, really smart
growers go and tour their competitors
[SPEAKER_00]: grows if they can get into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can learn best practices from
other people and then bring them home to
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that kind of research and development
is really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to sit on social media and be
obsessing about what other people are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and that you'll that'll just all end
in tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second point you make about
collaborative, you know, I tell my clients
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is something that everybody
needs to take from hip hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the most brilliant
marketing things to come out of hip hop is
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea of guesting on somebody 's album.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use guesting to either have a a
popular artist help build the career of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's just coming up or you can
take two very popular artists and have
[SPEAKER_00]: them guest on a song together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're they're trading audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're they're both enriched by
that partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is a fantastic
example that fits very well with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you will be seeing more
and more of these co-branded products come
[SPEAKER_00]: out as as the industry gets beyond the
prohibition competitive secretiveness and
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes more open to working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know where I think that has to
happen as soon as possible is within with
[SPEAKER_00]: artisan cannabis growers, the heritage
growers, because because if the heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, you know, since the one acre cap
was removed in California, it's turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into a bloodbath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the corporations have got the money,
the organization and the experience to
[SPEAKER_00]: just come in and roll out these large
marketing programs and inundate the market
[SPEAKER_00]: with brand messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the heritage farmers, while
they've got better flour, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily have the messaging reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as artisan growers can come
together and work together and and get
[SPEAKER_00]: their messages out as as a group on why
heritage farming and why small farms are
[SPEAKER_00]: important and why, you know, growing and
living soils is is preferable for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting artisan flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, more power to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one one farm in California
that's doing a great job with that is Moon
[SPEAKER_00]: Time Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, their website,
you know, they they know it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, they know how to talk about
the importance of artisan, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: farming heritage farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they are they're they're
legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the Hill in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being in Humboldt County,
that's that's pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been doing it for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and the fact that, you know,
they they know how to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use KNF, we use inputs from our own
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why you should care about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, not everybody is into that
because a lot of yet because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage farmers have never really needed
to market in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will get up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and if and if they don't, it's going
to be a lot harder road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up another good point,
too, which is sort of what message are you
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put out there, you have to be,
I think, very conscious of what what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want your brand, what values you want your
brand to promote and then make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're consistent across your social media
posts to promote that branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for example, if you're going
to be a high end craft cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_01]: then your photos need to look high end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put up, you know, crummy photos
from a bad, you know, bad phone camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to take professional
photography photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, too, along that line,
there's so many Instagram accounts now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which seems to be still the major platform
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many Instagram accounts that
just have photos of of buds or or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wax or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin, you know, some just photos of the
actual product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I scroll through my Instagram
feed, a lot of them are just the same
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you differentiate yourself from
all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you, you know, take unique looking
photos or take a different perspective on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how do you create a message around that
and be more than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bud shots, but actually a lifestyle brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you create that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important that
people think about that when they start
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about their social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually requires a little bit of
thought.
