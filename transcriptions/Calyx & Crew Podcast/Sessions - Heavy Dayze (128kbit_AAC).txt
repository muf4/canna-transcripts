[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody and welcome to another
exciting episode of the calyx and crew
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast I'm your host as always dot calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a very special episode today I
have an idol of mine somebody that I
[SPEAKER_01]: really look up to especially in the work
that I do We've got none other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: man himself heavy days of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all welcome heavy days How you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me my friend
what a what a cool opportunity it is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the show and Really stoked to be
here to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was such a nice intro man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have to give you massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you taking your time to come
out and Spend this with me and get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: you a little bit more Obviously,
you've been doing this a lot longer than I
[SPEAKER_01]: have so like I said, you're somebody that
I've kind of looked up to in that aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with From the beginning so I
can get to know you a little bit more When
[SPEAKER_01]: did you first get into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question I think So so my very first
experience My mother at the age of 30 has
[SPEAKER_00]: finally told me that she did have a joint
when she was pregnant with me for morning
[SPEAKER_00]: sickness So I guess I get to now be OG and
say in utero, but I always remember the
[SPEAKER_00]: dragonfly Guys said that and I thought
that's pretty cool Anyway, so the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time I ever smoked weed I think I had that
pretty classic experience where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really get high because you're not really
sure what you're doing and you know You
[SPEAKER_00]: probably didn't really draw it down into
your lungs But then the next time I did I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little more high but to me Sort of
in that early period the one that really
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out as super unique was me and some
buddies were um Like in this little forest
[SPEAKER_00]: area near my house I was lucky enough to
grow up in an area called tweed heads like
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out tweed breed and basically really
nice coastal town in Australia and There
[SPEAKER_00]: was this little forest and we had like
found some shopping trolleys that were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest And so like we just tipped them
over on their sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like this cool little makeshift
couch and we got super high and Basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was maybe one of the first or
within the first few times I'd ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: like indoor Weed because in Australia
Outdoor is quite common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like a young person,
you know beggars can't be choosers You're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably getting a lot of bushweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had this sort of potent indoor stuff
and I got so high I remembered looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy sitting on the shopping trolley
cart with you know The trees as the
[SPEAKER_00]: backdrop behind him and very distinctly
saying to him like oh man Like you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a green screen behind you like that the
trees in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not real man That's a green screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the outline around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's fake and I guess in retrospect
it was sort of the first real psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience because I'd gotten high but
like I was I was truly like Having some
[SPEAKER_00]: visuals and I guess a reflection of having
such a low tolerance, but that one always
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted with me I loved it and then one
other one which I'll mention which I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't really mentioned before was as I
was mentioning We're getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: bushweed right like and and the Australian
bushweed is largely speaking heirloom tie
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties so they're like these big tie
varietals that handle the Heat and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity really well you get huge yields
off them Unfortunately, they didn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: have that tie effect that you would hope
for like this really nice You know
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur sativa sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't quite the high but it had
most of the other characteristics so one
[SPEAKER_00]: time I get this batch of weed and It's
distinctly minty in smell I'd never had
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like it very minty and it looked
like essentially what sort of tie sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: look like nowadays and I hadn't really
experienced that so I tried This stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was truly memorable, but I never had
the words to describe why I liked it so
[SPEAKER_00]: much and looking back It was because it
was like it was uplifting and creative and
[SPEAKER_00]: really fun and me and all my friends had
it at a party It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when I first got into weed I
sort of didn't think I had these very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting stories and then the more I
thought about it I'm like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, like I guess I have had some cool
stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be how I sort of first got
into it Awesome, man, and I you've come
[SPEAKER_01]: such a far way Since that moment,
you know you you're doing more than I even
[SPEAKER_01]: knew about Honestly, I didn't pay that
much attention to podcasts when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this maybe a couple years ago I'm
still pretty fresh at it But it's funny
[SPEAKER_01]: when I get people ask me, you know,
what podcast do you listen to doc?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like I I really don't listen to
podcasts It's kind of a weird thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: do this and I don't really listen to very
many but one of the ones that I am always
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent of Is the podcast and that's
because I've always appreciated you as an
[SPEAKER_01]: interviewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very articulate You get very deep
into things that mean a lot to people like
[SPEAKER_01]: you and people like me that actually grow
this plant Steward this plant and love and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a passion for it So we can speak from
that perception, you know of like the home
[SPEAKER_01]: grower So it's really cool seeing you get
in with some of the biggest names and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you know, especially people that
I would just Dream of fucking talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have this Amazing catalog buildup
from you doing this over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did we go from your first experience
with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: into I'm gonna create a podcast and This
is where we're gonna go with it How did
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the good question would be how did
a man from Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where this is such a hard fucking thing to
you know be public with Go from that to
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming the podcast Again now I gotta
start off like thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta gotta keep my head from getting
too big You're giving me too many
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments But I really do appreciate
that you take the time to listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and I totally understand what you're
talking about Like when you're running a
[SPEAKER_00]: show Sometimes you get like audio fatigue
and it's almost hard to find the the
[SPEAKER_00]: mental space to listen to other stuff So I
totally get you there's still a few shows
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to I am I try to stay in touch
with all the guys who I'm homies with so
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself do grow show Breed is
syndicate Adam done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sort of the the staple ones I
check out for sure But I think your
[SPEAKER_00]: question is um is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I've thought about that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think that there's a lot of factors at
play and it plays into what you said part
[SPEAKER_00]: of my success has been the momentum I got
from certain episodes and I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge that that I was very lucky to
get certain guests and that gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain amount of momentum that I think I
wouldn't have had otherwise So I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely want to acknowledge that and I
think the obvious one would be I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two episodes really set me up to be
able to approach other guests But to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more to the heart of your question How did
I go from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah being like sort of this guy in
Australia to doing the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Situationally there wasn't too
many podcasts at the time So I I had made
[SPEAKER_00]: the transition from like a smoker to a
grower and I was watching the weed nerd I
[SPEAKER_00]: was watching Emerald cup talks There was
this one that used to be up about the rev
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about just giving organics a try
and that sort of got me into organics and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would watch sub cool and I'd use
his super soil recipe So I'd sort of watch
[SPEAKER_00]: these different programs and I was just
learning I wasn't growing particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: great weed at the time very much still
learning and after a while I sort of felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like I had watched all of the content on
like YouTube that I could sort of get my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on that was interesting and I felt
like there was a really good amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: information for entry-level growers,
but at a certain point I was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced sort of content and I The
names on the tip of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy from Portland he I'm gonna
at some point in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll remember and I'll chime in and say it
but there was one guy I used to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: Meddy Cropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his name Meddy Cropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked his content I felt like it was
like a little more targeted a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced But basically I just sort of
looked at it and I was like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like there's a bit of a vacuum
here There's a lot of great content for
[SPEAKER_00]: entry-level people, but there's not too
much intermediate stuff And there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing advanced really and I don't know
if I put my show in the category of
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced I'd say it's probably more
Intermediate in the grand scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but I just thought you know what
like no one's doing it So that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous right because you they can't
compare you to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's helpful It sort of it makes
it makes your thing better if it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: judge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought to myself man Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I thought let's do it and I
started messaging people and like no one
[SPEAKER_00]: really got back to me and I think that was
because I I can't remember how I was
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching people but what year was a
Good question 2015 I think Wow 2015 so I
[SPEAKER_00]: should give a little more context in the
two years prior to that I had started an
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and I was trying to be active in
the Australian community and I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving away seeds and I was just hoping
some people would grow them so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds before I started the show and
Part of my motivation to start the show
[SPEAKER_00]: was that I just legitimately had a bunch
of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask the big breeders and I
knew that I think I tried typing some out
[SPEAKER_00]: one day and after I got to like a page
worth of questions I was like no one's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna like, you know, if I got an email
like this, I'd be like no way too hard
[SPEAKER_00]: basket So I sort of thought a podcast was
an interesting way to circumvent that
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me and Essentially be able to like
ask a whole bunch of questions to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: but because it's recorded Everyone gets
the benefit from it and the breed is more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be like, yeah, I'll give that a
go So there was a few considerations at
[SPEAKER_00]: play but I thought like it could work and
at the time I was like and even up until a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more recently I am I was like toying
with like stand-up comedy and so like I
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of had an idea of how to talk to
people and How to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought let's just Let's just
try to blend it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh and then the final thing was I I've
always enjoyed producing music in my spare
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like playing music I like writing music
so I had like the audio know-how to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to like put so I was really lucky in
that I sort of felt like there was these
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four different pieces of the
puzzle and I just like Coincidentally had
[SPEAKER_00]: them all so I was like, okay I can on a
technical level I can make the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that so yeah, I mean responses from
people and Then I eventually just started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to Duke Diamond and he was sort of
obviously incredibly generous and nice
[SPEAKER_00]: with his time but he sort of I asked
enough questions that he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, like I don't think this is gonna be
terrible and He jumped on and we did that
[SPEAKER_00]: first episode and it sort of all went from
there and I have to be honest I never
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated it was gonna be as successful
as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I said the first episode to my
friends and like cannabis friends and And
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all like, oh, yeah, that's
really cool, man Like where'd you find it
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever and I was like, oh,
that's me and at the time they'd never
[SPEAKER_00]: heard my voice So they didn't and and
they're like that's not you and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like seriously I'm gonna I'm gonna
try to do this show, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and So it was a huge surprise to all of us
that it went so well, but Definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: labor of love and one that sort of really
took off With a lot of its own momentum
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really really cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that you did any of the
audio editing or anything like that You
[SPEAKER_01]: said you were musical as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look I try to be in my spare time I
am I I play guitar and I play bass and on
[SPEAKER_00]: a good day I like to think I can play
drums and on a very good day I can maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: Play a bit of piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nothing, I'm sure I'm sure everyone out
there who plays an instrument could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably play it better than me on their
instrument but I can play a few which is
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful and then I I don't really say it
too much But like any of the music or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you've ever heard in the show is
just like stuff I've made in my spare time
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, I like to do a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps me relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find I love music for that Are you
telling me right now that all the music
[SPEAKER_01]: that you hear?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the podcast you've created Yeah,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the bird noise is everything Yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you just record that right like I
just recorded that in the field Still
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really amazing man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think my audio skills are up there
But I think it's really cool that you and
[SPEAKER_01]: I play the exact same instruments So yeah,
I'm not a master at any of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would say guitar is my main,
you know, I mean circumvent Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah instruments we both dabbled in audio
before we got into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn cool, man I've got a
couple questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to get through really quick right
here from our patreon members list Dank
[SPEAKER_01]: Magician says what is your favorite guest?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a chance to interview Dank
Magician, thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one that I am always like battling
myself internally Because I got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites and people always say to me like
what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think undeniably a lot of people Really
enjoyed the chimera interview because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was probably one of the few interviews I
did that does fall into that more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: category and So that was quite memorable
because I was able to have quite a high
[SPEAKER_00]: level discussion with someone about
genetics So that was really cool on a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like episode 40 By always be
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some very very modern takes on a
lot of issues and I listen to it now and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could totally believe it was recorded
yesterday like everything he says is still
[SPEAKER_00]: so incredibly relevant and accurate and he
talks about strains that are like Still in
[SPEAKER_00]: the common zeitgeist of like hype stuff
today and this interview was done like
[SPEAKER_00]: three plus years ago I really like that
and his whole thing that I took away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like rather than getting mad At
these other dudes like, you know secure
[SPEAKER_00]: your own bag, like, you know, don't get
angry at someone else doing it Like for
[SPEAKER_00]: the most part, you know do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love that the the skunk BA
episode I think is is a brilliant one
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's a fantastic storyteller and
Largely speaking the episode is just him
[SPEAKER_00]: recounting his life story as opposed to
other episodes where like we talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about your life and then like a whole
bunch about breeding and stuff he was just
[SPEAKER_00]: Largely speaking just telling you his life
story, which I thought was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those ones would be up there for sure
But I'm also gonna throw out a
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love the masonic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a a different perspective and
I try to do the show is like I try my best
[SPEAKER_00]: to just Not be too fussy with like there's
a lot of people who'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh don't get such-and-such on I don't like
them and I try not to listen to that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff too much and just get anyone on
who I'm genuinely interested in and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really glad I got my sonic on because his
views are so like contrary to the common
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers you hear for questions about
breeding about Collaborations things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was it was very different
probably very polarizing but I did enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: that one I have to admit do you know we've
all got what we like and what we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like but as Our job is podcasters is not
deciphering that it's Interviewing these
[SPEAKER_01]: people taking in their perspective and how
they view the world and then letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: viewers decide for themselves,
you know So yeah, I completely respect
[SPEAKER_01]: that Patreon member stone stew says does
he remember there being name strains back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day or like where I grew up It was
just weed or orange bud purple bud Etc.
Etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question wag we back then Look
I am I didn't get named weed for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part There was one or two instances where
I've got better quality weed and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: told that it was white rhino More recently
when I'm like, you know in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene and had some really good white rhino
I can't exactly vouch that the stuff I had
[SPEAKER_00]: back then was white rhino But I guess that
would be something which among my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: circle growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always touted like, you know Bro
white rhino white widow men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the strongest strains on earth
if you can get them Surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got anything that was called
mullin bimby madness Even though I grew up
[SPEAKER_00]: not that far probably about two hours or
so from sort of that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, surprisingly never got given that
but yeah, definitely I remember white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow white rhino We're said to be the
best thing ever and then I remember when I
[SPEAKER_00]: turned 18 I went to Amsterdam I tried
white water right widow and I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking I've had other stuff here that
was stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Soma's sour diesel Soma's diesel I
thought was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that answers it for you my
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, I have to ask for myself did you
ever have any encounters being in that
[SPEAKER_00]: region with the PNG I Don't in my heart of
hearts, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I wish I could have it's like it's
the Moby Dick man I'm chasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone says it's the best but yeah,
I'm just not sure I got a buddy of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: Who says he might have some seed stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you'd have to grow it
outdoors, you know, it's it's meant to be
[SPEAKER_01]: so gnarly Yeah, especially something
that's become acclimated to that region
[SPEAKER_01]: for so long So it'd be Doing what you do
Was there ever any major worry?
[SPEAKER_01]: About being in the public eye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, obviously still now But but was
there ever a point where you were like
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck maybe I should quit this or maybe I
should slow down Did you ever have any
[SPEAKER_01]: doubt and what you were doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a few times I think My barometer has
always been my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've I've largely speaking When I first
got into cannabis, I was with this really
[SPEAKER_00]: great girl Who allowed me to do a lot of
growing even though she wasn't a smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will always be grateful to her for
that And then I've also been with my wife
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the whole time the public has
known me I've only ever been with those
[SPEAKER_00]: two women and they would always be the one
who would tell me when I'm Getting a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: too grandiose with how many plants I've
gotten Maybe it may be right railing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit So I do need to give a shout out to
them for being the voice of reason
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there have certainly been times
where I've been concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said to people look I've
actually never had any issues and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason for that is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Absolutely do not associate with anyone
who sells or uses hard drugs now I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go into the ethics of like,
you know anything about that really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Like I think drugs should
probably be legalized and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everyone I knew who ever got in
trouble It was always through that right
[SPEAKER_00]: it was and so I just thought as a point of
precaution purely speaking I would limit
[SPEAKER_00]: my social circle in that respect And as a
result, I've actually never had any issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that sort of speaks volumes
for itself in a sense so there have been
[SPEAKER_00]: times when I have been a little bit
worried about being a bit too public like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you know the podcast it's out there,
you know, the Australian police could look
[SPEAKER_00]: it up and Decide maybe they want to try to
find out who does that but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they are because they largely speaking
Have come out on the public record.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done like AMAs on reddit
surprisingly But they've done AMAs and
[SPEAKER_00]: people Have asked them, you know,
like do you trawl through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: subreddits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trawl through cannabis forum blah
blah and they were just like we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the resources, you know, like we're too
busy trying to stop murders and rapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: If something gets put in our lap if if
your neighbor calls us up and says they
[SPEAKER_00]: saw it like sure we'll do something but
we're not we're not putting any resources
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and so for me I think that bit of
knowledge in combination with that little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of precaution I take is largely
speaking being able to steer me pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: keep me on the pretty straight and narrow
so to speak because I'm sort of like Not
[SPEAKER_00]: really bothering anyone and like I oh and
the other thing I should mention is like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sell weed That's like a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me which helps Like I don't
sell any weed period like I sell seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't sell weed so I think that
helps as well because um Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a different clientele Yeah,
it's a good mindset to have and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been something that's helped me out
as well, you know Obviously, it's much
[SPEAKER_01]: more accepted over here But where you know
back in the underground days I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: there was no regard Is to a plant count if
you were gonna get busted with ten you
[SPEAKER_01]: were gonna get busted with a hundred You
were going away either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem So where there was kind of
disregard for that then it kind of came
[SPEAKER_01]: into this podcasting and everybody's like
Oh when you're gonna be you know hunting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know five different land races and
shit again I'm like I I just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart with what I'm doing now to to be
like that anymore Not associating with
[SPEAKER_01]: people that do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely share that one in common and
I am a firm advocate of Decriminalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: deep penalizing the plant Where it's not
something that anybody profits off of sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's offshoots like podcasts and things
like that But the actual product itself I
[SPEAKER_01]: would rather see it like tomatoes in your
garden than anything else and I'd rather
[SPEAKER_01]: see neighbors sharing it amongst each
other You know, you want to try some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour diesel you want to try some of
this rude boy, whatever And that's how it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be something that's there And
that's kind of my perspective on it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: man fully fully I am it's an interesting
one I still am not sure a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: where I land on that one But what I can
definitely say for sure is it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: the 215 model was superior to what
Australia has now or What California has
[SPEAKER_00]: now like, you know, we're like home
growers are supplying dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: then other people can get it from there
like to me that model sounded really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: sound And it's unfortunately not the case
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's only a few big producers
and they don't do a particularly good job
[SPEAKER_00]: at it But hopefully that changes in the
future, you know Have not heard good
[SPEAKER_01]: stories yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple Australian growers over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple medical patients that Have
gotten that stuff and they say they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: rather get stuff off the street most the
time because it was better Quality than
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that they were getting access to
oh Yeah, yeah the in my opinion and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well regarded as like, you know,
it's it's the general consensus the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality stuff you can get in the
Australian medical system is Imported from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that indicate like it's it's
not the best, you know, like the best is
[SPEAKER_00]: staying there We're getting I joke around
with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say man, we're getting like the floor
scrapings, you know and yet that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best you can Get so it's such an
indictment on the quality of the domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: produce stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly the companies are new,
you know, these Canadian companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: been around a long time so they've sort of
got the production down a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: but So much room for growth and and there
are some companies doing some cool stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've Heard of a few things, but yes such a
long way to go Our patreon member green
[SPEAKER_01]: which says have you ever interviewed
anyone that pissed you off and you hung up
[SPEAKER_01]: if So who was That one no, no,
no, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I guess like let me answer that
question and say yeah Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when people say things
that I'm definitely like that's not my
[SPEAKER_00]: view and I generally wouldn't I would hope
that you don't notice those moments
[SPEAKER_00]: because my goal is that you you don't pick
up on that however as a point of sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: journalistic integrity something I
realized very early on in the show was
[SPEAKER_00]: that Many opportunities to like sort of
try to voice your own opinions and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, I might have asked someone
to come on the show and like maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: said yes and then like never turned up or
maybe they never replied and like there
[SPEAKER_00]: have been times when I've like like
anyone, you know in a moment of Weakness,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you want to leave a snarky
comment or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to rise above that and
recognize that if you say one thing or if
[SPEAKER_00]: like right now I would say yeah this guest
said this blah blah blah then any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential guests in the future will will
you sort of lose integrity with them
[SPEAKER_00]: because The guest needs to ultimately
trust that um, you know anything They're
[SPEAKER_00]: not comfortable with will be removed that
you know, you're not going to try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them look too bad So hundred percent men
there there have been people who have said
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit that I do not agree with Then
unfortunately, I can't tell you their
[SPEAKER_01]: names Exactly much respect on that one,
man So let's talk about Breeding really
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I knew about until
fairly recently How long have you been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good question probably the first
intentional seed cross I made was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 2014 Wow, and then I don't and then I
don't think I made one For another year or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tested some of those seeds and I just
kept growing What I did was I did this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross very early on into My growing career
so I can say yeah, I made this cross all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way back then But I then recognized
that there was no point breeding when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was still growing relatively shit bud And
so I just needed to learn to grow better
[SPEAKER_00]: weed first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the cross I made was
Dynafem's strawberry amnesia Cross to a
[SPEAKER_00]: blue ox male by rare dankness and I just
jokingly called the name blue story
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like it never got out I never
really did much with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just easy even though I'm sure
there are strains called blue story
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it was a really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up making these um Really sativa
body plants they had this strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: amnesia structure But then they had like
this sort of indica potency from the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: ox the blue ox was like a blueberry cross
to bubba kush sort of thing So real indica
[SPEAKER_00]: meets sativa hybrid really cool plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this one keeper feno I still
daydream of it was like strawberry flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: with like true vanilla I've never had it
outside of this one plant but like true
[SPEAKER_00]: vanilla as I said, I daydream about this
thing and Anyway, yeah, that was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: cross I did and then it was a few years
later at that time I was studying my
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrad Graduate degree which was it was
a Bachelor of Science and I had two majors
[SPEAKER_00]: I did one in chemistry and one in
molecular biology and genetics So I had an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what I was doing, but I wasn't
growing great bud So then I just focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on growing good bud took me about a year
Got better progressively and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: started breeding again And I'm really
stoked to say that some of those earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses are the things I'm working on now
and this would play into something I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to people I I'm trying to get
back to that point because the period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'm talking about I didn't have as
many preconceived ideas about genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: back then as I did now and I picked stuff
that I just it was interesting the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions were cool it was like
something I'd never heard of and I truly
[SPEAKER_00]: think that like some of the crosses I made
with that sort of stuff are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to me because A lot of it was
unintentional, you know, I might have
[SPEAKER_00]: bought a certain pack of seeds going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Let's breed with this and then
something else happens to produce a male
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting and you're like,
you know what this might actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: better So I I encourage it and I myself am
trying to do it where I'm trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to like almost like not looking at
the breeder and just reading the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions and just looking at the
parents and and trying to just pick stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's different because until these days
regards to breeding is like You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't compare to JB's Cook Cushman's
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so um, you know, don't hedge your bets
and try to do a Cushman hybrid There's
[SPEAKER_00]: already people doing it like maybe instead
try to do something that's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different because people will genuinely be
interested if you're like, yeah I use this
[SPEAKER_00]: blue amnesia this story amnesia across to
this blue ox thing and you've probably
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of either of those But it's
it's a nice plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you I think that's a way forward
for people who feel like we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner of genetics And they're not
entirely sure where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say stop by just picking
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool That's cool that you brought
that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard the blue ox name for a
while But that was one that I was really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in I never got to grow very
much a bird dankness is stuff I should say
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott But that blue ox that was one that
really excited me the only one I ever grew
[SPEAKER_01]: was the ghost train haze and That one died
off for me after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all right to begin with and then it
just kind of peeked out There was another
[SPEAKER_01]: one about that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it was called night terror
Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay that one that one was one that I'd
probably still grow that to this day I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been kind of looking at No, so out of
everything that you've made What are some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the standout ones to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you most proud of like if I was
gonna say heavy days you've got three
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that You can take and say I want
this to represent my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Great question Okay, so The first one
which most people would be aware of with
[SPEAKER_00]: my work would be the raspberry mama
Basically, this is a phantom kush f2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a pack of phantom kush from Ken's
GDP It's pink champagne across to Ken's
[SPEAKER_00]: kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a Mother that was very chant pink
champagne leaning and a father that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the same structure appeared to be very
pink champagne leaning I bred those
[SPEAKER_00]: together So I made f2s and then from that
pop seed Found a mum that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely what I was looking to find right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically pink champagne So then
I got that in like 2016 and I sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: established myself with it It's like this
really nice indica kushi thing with like a
[SPEAKER_00]: baked raspberry Tart sort of vibe a bit of
champagne to it really nice perfumey
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis It's not gonna put you to sleep,
but it's like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as the perfect afternoon
weed It's like it's gonna take the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: off your shoulders, but still leaving you
able to get up and do stuff But you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I don't feel like it's the end
of the day I feel sort of nice and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really good for anti-anxiety at the time I
was having like sort of sporadic general
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety and so it just hit it on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I loved it So I made some hybrids with
that in like 2017 maybe 2018 2017 I think
[SPEAKER_00]: and then It was only a very small limited
production they never got out too far but
[SPEAKER_00]: a few people who got those seeds like they
still hang on to the cuts and a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: them have made their way back to me,
which is really nice and I did hybrids I
[SPEAKER_00]: did s ones and then I had to move and In
the process of moving I lost the mum and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was crazy because I thought I had it
backed up with friends, but then it turns
[SPEAKER_00]: out like they had lost it as well and I
was shattered and I lost it and then Fast
[SPEAKER_00]: forward a few years a good buddy of mine
feral genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He popped some of those seeds He popped
the s ones turns out I gave him some and I
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of forgot He's like yeah,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them out Like not only do I have
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already grown them out I didn't tell
you I've popped them three months ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to harvest and One of them
is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, yeah, cuz he'd never
seen the mum So I went there and I smell I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, holy fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it Like not not nine out of
ten it like ten out of ten it And more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, it was it was dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud was purple and I for the life of
me I could never have gotten raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: moment ago purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just like this green cushy plant So
as far as I was concerned this feno is
[SPEAKER_00]: better because it's everything the mum had
but it goes purple really easy so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool and So I got that and I've
been doing Work with that but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: that s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found It's still just one of my
favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so definitely the raspberry mama,
which A lot of people don't know what pink
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne is think of like a cherry pie
sort of thing like a unique Berry tart
[SPEAKER_00]: perfume sort of vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's similar to cherry pie in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'd be the Phantom the raspberry
mama the next one would be the jelly
[SPEAKER_00]: breath that I found From in-house
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've then worked that into a bx2 line So
that would be the other one because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really solid line In-house has done his
own jelly breath work But it uses a
[SPEAKER_00]: different cutting and I've spoken to both
him and the guy who found the cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: two-tone willies It's called the North
Cascade cut of jelly breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, mine's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wondering Yeah, yeah, so it's like
More of like a do-si-do leaning feno or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 50-50 Whereas my jelly breath is is
almost a hundred percent Mendo breath
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant So it's it's a very different
plant despite having the same name And so
[SPEAKER_00]: my jelly breath work is quite different to
in-house's jelly breath work But that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the other one so the bx2 which is
really cool and admittedly that it is um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, obviously in-houses work But I
feel like I've worked it into a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent bx2 line this particular feno
and then the final one Would be the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: jelly which I made more recently using
that jelly breath mother I referenced and
[SPEAKER_00]: then crossing it to some seed stock I was
incredibly lucky to get our buddy Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond So he gave me a chem D crossed to
the local H and I think he said to me He
[SPEAKER_00]: only gave it to like three or four people
and I was one I found a really nice male I
[SPEAKER_00]: hid it to the jelly breath and made this
strain I called dog jelly and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful man It's like cookies and like
super loud chem Dog and gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a really special one to me and
I've done my best to really get those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones out I found a few phenos that were
really nice and I've been giving them out
[SPEAKER_00]: to people all around Australia and I'm
starting to see it pop up more and more I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it would be really cool to get it
out more So I'm gonna sort of do my best
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that So that would be my three the
jelly breath bx2 the raspberry mama and
[SPEAKER_01]: the dog jelly and do you have those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in both regs and fems because I
know that you were doing films Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: great question man, so I have done the
fems and when I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: historically having done the raspberry
mama fems that made the s ones which then
[SPEAKER_00]: gave birth to the plant I use now I made
all the crosses back then with the
[SPEAKER_00]: intention of Trying to do reg versions of
them thereafter So at the moment as you
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced I've femmed the keeper mother
onto my other keeper mothers and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: the fem crosses but I'm also in the
process of Working regular lines of those
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do regular crosses in general,
you know I've done some different work
[SPEAKER_00]: with some different males but I
specifically wanted to do like a male a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular release of the fem line I released
because I was lucky enough when my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: found that s1 of the the female he also
found like a male in that pack and We were
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of quite suspicious at first and we
were like maybe it's like pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's some weird But we sort of
stress test this male and it dead set
[SPEAKER_00]: would not show you what sex it was Until
you actually put it into flower and let it
[SPEAKER_00]: go for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So My thought process is like there's a
there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small chance But there's a chance
that is in fact a male from fem stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is known to happen Sam the skunk man
spoke about it and Very low chance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're only meant to say oh Cool
right on man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can tell me about it because I'm
just trying to figure out if it's real or
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, but yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean You know, you never know what's
unless you're packaging them yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were in that grow yourself You
don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a bean rolled off the counter from a
different one You don't know what their
[SPEAKER_01]: process is like, but I've definitely had a
six-pack of fems I believe that was I
[SPEAKER_01]: think those were Alaskan Thunderfuck and
One or two of them popped up male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Just one just the one cool
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever do anything with it or it was
just sort of like a cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got rid of it right away Yeah,
no, I was like, well, that's not what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking for I mean most that that
market in itself the feminized seeds Those
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking for a very specific
thing, you know These are people with low
[SPEAKER_01]: plant counts or that just want to
guarantee females in their grow So when
[SPEAKER_01]: that pops up, it was just automatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all Yeah, no, I can appreciate
that for sure but yeah looking looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe cross that male to the same mothers
and Then see do those resulting seeds bear
[SPEAKER_00]: any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Resemblance to the feminized ones I made
obviously it's a different plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's from the same strain So you'd
think like it should be so like just some
[SPEAKER_00]: basic similarities just enough enough to
be able to be like Yeah, it doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's contaminated pollen and it's
totally something different Can I ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: a very controversial question Hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it How do you feel about breeding
regular seeds with feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Look I think the devil's in the detail,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as as a rule of thumb, I would say
that it appears Fairly certain from
[SPEAKER_00]: empirical evidence That you can breed like
you can get a mother from femme stock and
[SPEAKER_00]: then femme that onto other Stuff doesn't
seem to inherently increase the rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodism You can selectively see it
but it you don't see it across the board
[SPEAKER_00]: because people like Canarado That's his
whole business model is like make a series
[SPEAKER_00]: of femme hybrids Fino hunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best one is the one we reverse for the
next round of femme hybrids we make and
[SPEAKER_00]: the same is said for compound genetics and
It just doesn't seem that the empirical
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence is there that enough people are
putting Their hands up and saying hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like I'm getting at least one herm
a pack or something, you know And I sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of joke around with people and say that I
think you should honestly go into every
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunt with the expectation that one
plant will herm because a It's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: high of a bar, you know, you should give
people a little bit of slack You know
[SPEAKER_00]: plants herm every now and again and it
just happens but on top of that any more
[SPEAKER_00]: than that and you can start to have some
You know questions that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: unreasonable to be asked you know,
if you're getting two herms in a pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there is something unstable about
those genetics, but And if you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ten herms in a pack, it's probably on you
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um Yeah, it's definitely an
interesting topic I do suspect that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: famed on to famed on to fam for like
forever Then like yeah, you might see some
[SPEAKER_00]: Deviation in the way the genes express
themselves in terms of sexual stability,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think where they're longer
term and it seems as though like enough
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of fem stuff happens that you know,
if it is if it is increasing the rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: herm aphrodism it's happening very slowly
and we haven't in my opinion, we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: yet truly detected it and I think it's
just More anecdotal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I honest to God feel like I get less
homes now than I ever have Maybe that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection of my environment being more
dialed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah at the Moment I would happily
pop seeds that are like fem on to fam and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would happily make those sorts of seeds
and sell them So long as I was confident
[SPEAKER_00]: they were stable and that everyone sort of
knew what they were in my most recent seed
[SPEAKER_00]: release That I did the sort of version
twos of the raspberry mama fans I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it very clear that the plant I was
reversing was an s1 You know, so I I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make that very clear in a number of
ways in terms of like If you read the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions on the posts and the actual
infographics and all that But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think like as long as you're up
front about it Like this that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really up to the consumer to decide and I
myself as a consumer Don't I would run
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's gonna be home city,
so to speak Very very good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your honesty on that one
Okay, one of our patreon members dank
[SPEAKER_01]: magician wants to know What solution do
you use for your reversals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Matt Wright's reversal spray
in the past and had success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that spray I more
recently have used a local option which
[SPEAKER_00]: was Just in the past when I've used Matt's
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very successful for me,
but it comes from America You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a few weeks to arrive and
sometimes I'm not as organized as I should
[SPEAKER_00]: be and I don't have a few weeks,
unfortunately So I've been using some more
[SPEAKER_00]: local options, which I've had some good
success with my buddy has a company called
[SPEAKER_00]: Old sods reversal spray and that's an
Australian based company that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: who do a really nice STS solution It's
made fresh when you order it And you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also have the option of mixing it yourself
if you'd like I've had good success with
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I've also used another product by
a buddy Of mine called feral genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned him a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also sells an STS solution I think it's
a slightly different formulation and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had success with both of those products So
if you're an Australian person,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely check out those two guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got great products I would be
really interested in using hybrid techs
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, which is the cobalt chloride
solution as opposed to a sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate so Yeah, so I'm keen to give
the cobalt chloride solution I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but great things about hybrid
techs product, which is that but I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: had great success with STS I've never used
colloidal silver and I don't think I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: will because I just hear like it's it's a
bit finicky the application you got to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it constantly and Yeah, just seems like
less efficient to me How often are you
[SPEAKER_00]: using that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, which one are we talking about
specifically the one that did you say you
[SPEAKER_00]: were using the cobalt recently no I would
like to use that but I haven't but
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently it's literally a once
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to I Can't remember who it was
So they all say one time but um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I tend to use an STS spray a couple of
times just to really ensure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saturating all those nodes because it's
really like that axial branching node
[SPEAKER_00]: point that you really want to try to
saturate so III go against the rules and I
[SPEAKER_00]: apply STS a few times and I don't see any
negatives to it And I like to think it
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly increases my chances of getting a
successful reversal However, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: told I'm quite good authority that that
cobalt one you really only need to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time as hybrid tech advertisers
because Apparently like it stresses the
[SPEAKER_00]: plan out a bit if you um, if you applied a
number of times I've seen some very
[SPEAKER_00]: frazzled looking plants and the other
thing to quickly mention because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: people may not know this until they've
done a few reversals the first reversal I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever did went reasonably successful in the
grand scheme of things and Then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: two I did went horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went into them thinking this is
easy I've done it before it worked like I
[SPEAKER_00]: just sprayed it and it just worked And so
it's worth noting that like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse a plant to make feminized seeds
It's sort of it's not like a binary
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like all this plant successfully
reversed all this plant didn't it's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually like oh, there's some bananas,
but most Female buds or it's like all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way through to there's no bananas and on
the other end of the spectrum It's
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing as if it's an entirely male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it truly is important to reverse a
couple plants I would say three is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: number and you'll be fairly certain to get
one that will reverse really nicely and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll just get like that male Morphology
and it's just dump and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want because I've had like
two that have just sort of Like not really
[SPEAKER_00]: got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really releasing much pollen
at all and it's like a failed reversal And
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind and if you are making
feminizes anyone out there always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: male backup Mass Medical taught me this
and it's true because um, I Did this fem
[SPEAKER_00]: run and the fem failed and I had it I had
a different strain I was also spraying and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like if the the main one doesn't
work I use the backup one and the backup
[SPEAKER_00]: one didn't work either so Like at the end
of the day, yeah at the end of the day You
[SPEAKER_00]: need a male that you know will produce
pollen on cue if it's in the right light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle So, um, yeah, that would be a bit of
advice too Otherwise, you'll end up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a sensei crop when maybe you are
hoping to have some seeds Very very good
[SPEAKER_01]: answer So we have a few more minutes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna ask you a few more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to get into the other
controversial one really quick Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you feel about testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question Like just to make
sure we're talking the right thing like
[SPEAKER_01]: THC contents and stuff No testing your
genetics for stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that it's there's no
there's no hard and fast rule But I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's important to be very upfront
with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example the most recent raspberry
mama release I did I Had not finished
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering out those plants yet because
they were remakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already made those crosses a few
years ago so in that situation I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really felt like it was going to achieve
much more than what I already had in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the information because it was like I'm
just doing the v2s so That situation is
[SPEAKER_00]: one where I felt comfortable for it to go
out and then when I did that seed run I
[SPEAKER_00]: had some new mothers in the room and those
ones didn't really go out because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still testing those now because I'm just
Some of the mothers are new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as familiar with them I remember I
was talking to JJ from top dog genetics a
[SPEAKER_00]: while ago and he said something that
lasted with me Which is like you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: should test everything right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for someone like him if he's got like
a certain Tres dog male He's been breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with for like five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sort of knows how that matters Is
generally going to interact with things
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I'd be happy to accept if someone
said to me Hey, look, I've got this male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had for a number of years I've done a
few different lines with it like a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different releases like, you know Maybe 20
strains in total with it and I know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it works with I could probably tell you
it's not gonna pair well with these sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of strains They tend to her I could accept
that and be like, yep, that's I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept that that's reasonable empirical
evidence But I think that if you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: some totally new stuff It's important to
test it not from necessarily the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view because as Masonic does he's
so upfront I don't test anything like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like it's not tested, but I'm
charging you this price take it or leave
[SPEAKER_00]: it However, the reason why I think you
should test it is because it takes five
[SPEAKER_00]: years to build your reputation and five
minutes to destroy it and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why is really at risk is your reputation
because um You know at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like if someone stuff herms on me
It is what it is, you know, I'm never
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get that time back So it's sort of a
live and learn thing So I think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's tough one because and this is
the other thing, you know If someone grows
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds and they herm and you're like,
oh hey, I'd like to make it better and
[SPEAKER_00]: send you some seeds They probably don't
want to grow more of your seeds out And so
[SPEAKER_00]: it does leave you in a tough spot position
as a breeder because you might be like I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to make that right for you,
but it's I'm not exactly sure what so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's um It's it's an interesting one
to navigate that minefield But I think
[SPEAKER_00]: above all as long as you're honest No one
can really criticize you and if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure you don't end up with egg on
your face Maybe you should test but you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily need to Everybody has
their own goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely Before we get going here buddy,
I want to ask you Aside from things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've created What are your top three
favorite types of cannabis that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked to date?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great question man, I am I Used to
have as I mentioned earlier I used to have
[SPEAKER_00]: very bad anxiety like generalized anxiety
So it sort of just come on sporadically
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing specifically triggering it and for
that reason I struggled with sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't handle them However as I
got over that that was probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years ago as I got over that I Began
to enjoy sativas now to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like They're definitely my favorite
and they're probably I can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly say there will come a time when I
will only smoke sativas probably and so as
[SPEAKER_00]: a result some of my absolute favorite
varieties are like unique sativas I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely if I had to give you three
Genius from Brothers Grimm is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most memorable clones I've been able to
smoke it was unlike 90% of sativas out
[SPEAKER_00]: there It was it was um uplifting and
cerebral, but it was very clear-headed It
[SPEAKER_00]: was very focused some sativas like Cindy
99 you smoke them and it's great But every
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 seconds you're like, what was I doing
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got that fogginess but um
Genius was the opposite in the name fit
[SPEAKER_00]: man makes you feel like a genius so
clear-headed and focused and that was one
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure I've got to give a huge shout out
to Like Jack Harris like super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably gonna get me Clowned on a
bit, but being someone who didn't live in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, I've never been burnt out on Jack
Hara I've had some incredible samples of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hara and I think To me super silver
haze that keeper cut that you see floating
[SPEAKER_00]: around is in that same vein of like very
racy very uplifting piney Terpeneleon
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably a very like unexpected
answer But like I love that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the final one would be I had most
years when I've come over to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been lucky enough to spend the night
before I go home I would usually spend it
[SPEAKER_00]: at Bodie's house And I would just get to
smoke all these crazy land-race shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm jump on the plane or buzzed and
fly home and he gave me I Believe it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnamese number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's he posts about it on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it if you check it out You'll
find it Vietnamese number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know He popped who knows
how many Vietnamese seeds and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: number seven some of the most unique weed
I've ever had in my life like so
[SPEAKER_00]: Legitimately giggly like nothing is giggly
compared to this stuff like My dream would
[SPEAKER_00]: be to like do a comedy show and to force
everyone to smoke this on the way in it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be insane But um, yes, so uplifting
so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes one of a kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool We're both musicians both
appreciate sativas You do the comedy the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking I've been searching for giggly
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I feel that's been
Lost throughout time, you know something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really been bred out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say I've had any modern cultivars
I don't I don't truly believe That it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something That you can find in a lot of
modern cannabis anymore because everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that affected me that way I don't think it
was a tolerance to build up the THC that
[SPEAKER_01]: did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a certain endocannabinoid
profile that made that You know that
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and I get it with some ties and
that's why I appreciate ties so much but
[SPEAKER_01]: that is something that I've heard about
the Vietnamese and that's a Reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of looking that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if that was the Vietnamese
gold or the Vietnamese black or I I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know got on a limb, but sorry,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I Honestly don't know it was green so I
don't think it was the Vietnamese black I
[SPEAKER_00]: think he said that it was like a lowland
Vietnamese He said he thinks of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: like either highland or lowland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it was lowland So maybe the
highlands turn purple or something and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the Vietnamese blacks or I'm not a
hundred percent sure but I have had a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of them Ties a bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very memorable tie from Bodhi
actually it looked exactly picture-perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: like that infamous photo of Dr. Grinspoon
with like just the single alternating
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes Yeah, it was it was really cool
stuff equally special uplifting fun Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when I spoke to Bodhi as well,
he said that largely speaking the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: just move around in those areas and so
like Vietnamese tie it's like it's It
[SPEAKER_00]: could be very interchangeable really
similar similar regions Yeah, that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: cool man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I definitely want to
look into I Cannot wait to do another
[SPEAKER_01]: episode with you if you're ever down for
that because we got to cover so much I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned so much about you on this episode
You are very detailed and very skilled in
[SPEAKER_01]: your answers just like you are when you're
interviewing So I really appreciate having
[SPEAKER_01]: you on as a guest and you not giving a
fuck And sharing your true opinions on
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very cool You're too kind my
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the opportunity to
come on I would be honored to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: again and chat some more and Really really
lovely to be able to have a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with a contemporary and with
all the listeners, you know, I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it again Absolutely,
man Appreciate you again All of our
