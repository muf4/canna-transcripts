[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we get too long and drawn out,
we'll hop right into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are on the line with AK
Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, AK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the weather up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are starting to get some light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the light's coming back,
but we are in a kind of a freak thaw,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least 10 degrees above our norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're thawing out and it's kind of
muddy, icy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had quite a bit of snowpack,
about four feet of snowpack or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So light's coming back, but it's pretty
bad right now for weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it break up when it normally
happens in March 20th to April 10th around
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some hardcore break up,
but it's happening a little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for our tourism industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you can do in the winter up
here is call fur rendezvous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, all time for greater
celebration thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned into a modern day events and
it's going on starting tonight for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, they have dog mushing
races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much crap goes on, but it's on the
first Saturday in March is the Iditarod.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of kicks off the old dog
mushing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of sprint races,
but there's not a lot to do in Alaska in
[SPEAKER_01]: Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the winter, especially you go snow
machining or outdoor activities or skiing,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of skiing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bullshit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And activity is very little, but they
have, you know, fun shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice bowling, snow shoe, softball
tournament, running with the reindeer
[SPEAKER_01]: where these fools all run down our main
Fifth Avenue downtown in different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: with reindeer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty comical.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the little shit that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's kind of wild timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're interviewing today and I have a big
fire works and Anchorage is pretty boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our big snow bowling on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow bowling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clear early ice of all the snow and
ice bowling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they bowling with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just regular bowling pins and bowling
balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just on ice out on a lake right at
one of the main establishments here in
[SPEAKER_01]: town.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big, big bar, the sports bar
kind of big sports bar place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little events all over like that,
but we're, we're that podunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that do come tourism wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always want to visit the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't come this weekend or this,
and there's big snow sculpture,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, competition too, which is,
that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some real good sculptures,
but if you didn't come this two weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks in the winter, it's pretty
damn dark and cold with nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you just have a friend that has a
cabin in the middle of nowhere and good
[SPEAKER_01]: snow machining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go just tear it up or
you, you know, if you're targeting a
[SPEAKER_01]: scheme or something like that,
that's, that's an attraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, there's, I mean,
remember if we had any concerts this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: year, they don't send us a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of an off couple years
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get, we get the least out of anybody on
the normal year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of live music events going
on over right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next two weeks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of good comedy guys come up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all targeting this, whatever
tourism money is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we all get a, we get a sense of
relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: All Alaskans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, we realize about,
about, uh, Valentine's day, most Alaskans
[SPEAKER_01]: see the difference in light coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're started gaining about four,
three or four minutes a day by then five
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes a day, almost coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of get a different attitude
and see a renewals the sun coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a renewal of life and the new
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the last two years, uh,
everybody, you know, be in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be like a brand new fresh
year and nice this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good for us to come down and go
fishing this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, there was two years ago,
I didn't go fishing one time because the
[SPEAKER_01]: town that I go fishing out of Whittier
and, uh, it's one of the entrance to
[SPEAKER_01]: Prince William sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had massive restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The town has a tunnel to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the longest tunnel in North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they built it in the forties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Army Corps of engineer did it for army
purposes, but there's a fuel depot over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the fuel anchorage comes through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, they closed down a lot of
restrictions and it included, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the launch that I went to, you had to have
a COVID pass to be able to go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial part of the town, which was
where all the fish process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing is, and they had these,
you know, the fall meat houses and fish
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing around America was really
getting, uh, infected on that first wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were hundreds of people sick and
they couldn't take a chance of losing the
[SPEAKER_01]: fish industry on all these salmon that was
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they basically blocked the town and I
didn't get to go fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go, I didn't go at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year I tried to catch up and
things got in the way, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: last year I was almost normal,
but little shit got in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept fucking shrimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polar wouldn't work, bilge pumps,
base air pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing more maintenance than fishing,
but the boat's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's still winter full blown,
but, um, March 31st we can shrimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean not shrimp, but we can catch a snow
crab and red crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're fixing to get the boat in the
water early this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you, but I get super
antsy if I don't get outfishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gotta have my, gotta have my therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm antsy right now because that is my
stressor wish that, uh, getting over there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the boat and being in Prince William
sound, it's a special place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make it up here, you're going to
just like, Oh, we're going to make,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to make sure of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place is worth a visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept trying to get, uh, professor P to
go fishing when he came up here on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a like a four or five day visit,
uh, two or three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years ago, but he wasn't like
wanting to go jump in the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was, I know if it was you,
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did probably went to the cannabis cup
for about eight hours and spent about 40
[SPEAKER_01]: hours on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't have even had to tell me
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just jumped in that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your choice high times cannabis cup in or,
uh, I might spend a day there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm going there for the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check out the event,
but if we can, and one day there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking go fish in the rest of the time,
I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our events up here aren't quite like the
ones I've been to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to, I didn't go to a lot,
but I was able to go to a couple of high
[SPEAKER_01]: times and the San Bernardino Southern
California was pretty, pretty wild event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every big, uh, vendor was there and,
uh, you know how they are the big,
[SPEAKER_01]: big shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was almost like a, I guess that's in
between or near Coachella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the other, like, what was the
chalice and all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so those people are like geared up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not our style up here,
like five speeds lower up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking about being geared up,
let's get on some cannabis talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to you yesterday and you
said you wanted to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original SSSC brains that you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is something that people
hadn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it was a void of it for a lot of
time and tried, uh, genetics were dried up
[SPEAKER_01]: or missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there are a couple of real,
uh, that's a round of some of the original
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and people were wanting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, one of the things that I was able
to bring back a few of the strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine who was a big preserver
of that, uh, original drops of both seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank of Poland and the SSSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, uh, he was collecting just about
everything there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had grow a little bit of it,
but froze all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we'll take it out and check it
out or reproduce it one forward generation
[SPEAKER_01]: and get back up properly and freeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through, uh, through a younger guy,
uh, Blue Pass Skunk Lord, he's on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was friends with this older guy or had
met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him through the forums, which I
wasn't involved in at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hardly ever, ever got on forums or I
didn't really want to deal with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'd work a little bit and text stuff
out, but he was offering it years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back and did find old posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he, he went by old Detroit on some of
the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot if it was IC mag or whatever,
but they, they come up if you search them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was offering people the original
SSSC right out of the Manila acts just
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago and nobody, you look at the
thread, it wouldn't, it wouldn't even go
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was taking them up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like, their offer was out
there and people didn't seem to care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just like, I don't have
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hard to believe why there
wasn't, why there wasn't some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you gave it to a couple of guys,
maybe a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for even the people that are
interested, there's a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: skepticism when genetics have been gone
that long, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been a buried thread that
wasn't popular to the threads that do come
[SPEAKER_01]: up when you Google them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know how that, I'm not super
familiar with, you know, how the,
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole system worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like get on, find a little bit of
information and then go away again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but he did have a lot of strains
and then, uh, he had offered Williams
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder and Beatrix choice and M 48,
which was, uh, then 48 was the last thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that SSSC had produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did have some unreleased strains that
went higher than that number of M 48 and
[SPEAKER_01]: they never did hit the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are people that did get those
and, uh, it is even available and around
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know of another person that has an
entire collection of SSSC too,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're reproducing it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the M 48?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: M 48 was South African and haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, when I, I, I know Carl and,
uh, he's the, uh, originators of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the SSSC keys is the son of Carl,
who was the original reader and owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, through years ago, I had kind of
been collecting the, uh, some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was from original purchases,
really the seat catalogs from both the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank and SSSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like five of the original ones
that I had had from 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, somebody else that had some
different years, uh, we got together and
[SPEAKER_01]: he gifted me them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reproduced them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I had gotten ahold of SSSC
through like different channels because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was Daz at Mephisto got ahold of his buddy
in Europe who runs that side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitch Mitch knows keys real well,
cause they hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had them, I asked if I could
reproduce because, uh, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: copyrighted, uh, issues that I had gotten
ahold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked if I could reproduce them and,
uh, get them back to him and keys gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: full permission to go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went and made some real high quality
reproductions of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up with about five or six,
uh, SSSC catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a friend of mine, American one
on, uh, he's on IG and he's on different
[SPEAKER_01]: chats.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a good collector of, uh,
old cannabis, uh, super cool shit is the
[SPEAKER_01]: old cannabis trading cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, still in the cellophane or our
foil packs, like old bubble gum trading
[SPEAKER_01]: cards, the old cannabis line of,
I mean, that's crazy cause you got to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: a case of them and he still gets those
things out and they're vintage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he, he had the original copies of,
uh, both Neville's first year in business
[SPEAKER_01]: and SSSC's like handwritten black and
white type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an explanation of business first year
in business, how the success is doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: what lines are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd have a little list of what the
available genetics were the next year in
[SPEAKER_01]: 86.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like hybridized it almost made a
catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually made that, you know,
seed bank did make a catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville made actual catalog in 86 and
then, uh, the first, uh, real catalog for
[SPEAKER_01]: SSSC is 87.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had those, uh, I had those all
the way through like 91, 90, I think just
[SPEAKER_01]: the last one that I had or whatever it is,
but there's, they're like books.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put in a ton of information for grow
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very, very, very technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about 15 pages of information
on there from everything from step one to
[SPEAKER_01]: end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and it's got cool vintage shit,
like see a green of hundred and 44 that's
[SPEAKER_01]: at a time of one single strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a ton of cool information,
but, uh, the M 48 is, uh, the last one on
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a supplemental flyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had, I think, uh, got them sitting
around here as we go look at a little
[SPEAKER_01]: flyer and they had the M 48 on one in 47
was, I think, uh, to me, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 47 is, I need glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see what it says?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, super indoor sativa and M 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was on the flyer with that M 48
that he's South African.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had M 46 was on that flyer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super indoor Indica that, you know,
these are a little bit of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't really know unless you bought
those and the super indoor Indica looks
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they originally were offering that
Afghani ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the branded, uh, sacred seeds,
uh, logos and shit right on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but so did, uh, other producers at
the time, uh, Neville did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the first catalogs were all branded
with the sacred seed stuff because that
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one and from cultivators choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made about 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up with like 16 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodie, Bodie's friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I met Bodie and got lucky and met
this guy down in Emerald.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'd ever contacted him prior
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think I had these catalogs and
I gifted him some of the, uh, maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of them or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember just like,
it wasn't a major deal, but he had the,
[SPEAKER_01]: his friend's a photographer for the 1990,
1985, um, catalog where Neville goes and
[SPEAKER_01]: visits the hash factories in the Tiber
pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all a front cover of it is the
actual guys, you know, shows them holding
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, Afghan hash seed stock shows the
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're smoking a pretty wicked looking
water pipe and, uh, and his buddy did the.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's very great information,
but his buddy did all the photography work
[SPEAKER_01]: and had like a dozen original
uncirculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opi is of that seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, uh, I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would have originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives me an original and, uh,
he had about four others, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I asked him if I could copy him
and he is on his way to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years back, he was on his way to
Mexico to do that land race hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I forgot who he was going with,
but they were all geared up to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico and regional areas to find a bunch
of real good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's when he brought back to me
is that, uh, the old, uh, rustic,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, tobacco from Maria Sabina and bunch of
other cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he's going to the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me he would send me the catalogs
and I was like, well, don't go out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know you're, you're going to be busy
for months.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to be doing that stuff for
months on the track.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he did, he had his, he had his
wife go bring, go to the post and sent me
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four or five copies he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like super honored and,
uh, I copied them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to set, I think I delivered
them back at Emerald and delivered them
[SPEAKER_01]: back with copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything was so bad, but I,
uh, he got all of the, I, that way it
[SPEAKER_01]: increased the whole, a lot of the catalogs
to like 13 or 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got some of their more rare ones
after that, but there's their info.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, if you don't have them sitting
there, they're just go to and look for
[SPEAKER_01]: reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the original versus all this info is
then downloaded and formatted for the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a written copy in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've either gifted or, uh, there's,
there's times that so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sell seed combinations only, only way you
could get them was with seed combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people, um, some of them reposted
that info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information in public form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to grab a few of those
copies off that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essential information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care where you keep it at the
toilet, at the fucking coffee table,
[SPEAKER_01]: piss the wife off and leave them just out
off the coffee table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would bring a lot of memories back
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had a story to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a story and knew the exact moment that
they lost him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a flood of fire and aunt,
a dad, a mom, a FBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I heard every fucking incarnation
of how the catalogs could go away and
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've joked back and say, well,
you know how to get them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to look through a couple of them,
but back when those came out, I was more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a consumer than interested in growing
or breathing or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to handle one of those in the 87,
uh, high times they were advertising the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1988 seed bank of Holland magazine,
uh, seat catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that got him busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that brought the green
merchant shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have never, I've seen that I've seen
terrible black and white copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other people holding the
original color copies over in the England.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it wouldn't pass it to me to copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's the, that's the unicorn
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best, uh, that's photo
cover of all his shit or it's one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, anybody that has that,
uh, 1988 seed bank of Holland catalog,
[SPEAKER_01]: send it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll copy it and send back my full
collection of them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've offered that to a couple of guys that
have way larger collection of these and
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of like hold them too tight or I
don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody has that copy, get it over to
AK bean brains, and I will personally give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a handful of fucking, I am sending,
uh, you know, I'm buddies with your rising
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, the Indian land race exchange
and, uh, Oh, two or three of those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, that, that,
uh, I'm spacing out the name of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have that library way up in that
fucking elevation, uh, that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have been building, uh, up in Nepal
and, uh, the set of these are going over
[SPEAKER_01]: there to that, uh, housed inside that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see the thing, it's built up in the
fucking middle of nowhere rocks and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: library.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another set of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really lucky to friends with,
uh, he has, he's, uh, he was on it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, but that was, you know,
friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, he was best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a lot to do with Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew everything and had a lot of stuff,
but, uh, because Neville sister was
[SPEAKER_01]: applying for recreation, uh, for medical
permitting in, uh, Byron Bay, Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, they'd already gone quite a ways
through the permitting and they had all
[SPEAKER_01]: this set up and, uh, they are going to be
growing all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of his legacy stuff, the outback
haze and everything that he had left will
[SPEAKER_01]: be brought back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I was able.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get, you know, three or four sets of
these copies of, uh, of I sent them that
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the ones I had, you know,
just for general information, but his
[SPEAKER_01]: original specific stuff went right back to
Neville sister and she, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And went to his sons and his daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the ones that are rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to run the whole entire
operation, but you know, she put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: She framed them, put them in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty, pretty, uh, bullshit that
they got that stuff back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The D is the D is when it made it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in fact, he had another set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware that you guys knew each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a bunch of stuff to play around
with, but, uh, I wanted, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some NL two is kind of stuff, but he sent
me like NL two and low right original
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's really cool, but he told me
it was going to trigger it to 16 hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: should finish, you know, cause there,
he, where he's at, it would do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he says so much off of our system and
our light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, and I're growing it outside and
it's getting killer and beautiful and come
[SPEAKER_01]: down to 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sexing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 16 hours come down and no sexing
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 14 hours come down and no sexing at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's turning dark and getting purple
because our weather is already 40 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: and going down real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day that we hit, uh, about 13 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where a plant will trigger it's already
freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at these things and it was
a late on term for fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just left them out and there it is
about 13 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking near auto half auto from pure
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally trigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the first males and females and
then I had to move them inside to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a, uh, it's not a photo auto
usable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're kind of targeting for
autos up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't work real well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather is just way too harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% or, or not, uh, you know, weather
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have arthritis or aspergillus or any
of the natural fungus or moles are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to hit them and just they're, they're
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rain, the wind, if you got to grow
them, you know, in an open, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of like things that aren't going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have like a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried any of the original like
Siberian ruderalis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Neville's original stuff in 1990,
we did grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, they were way hardier and did
finish and then you'd get a hybrid one and
[SPEAKER_01]: four, just like skunk or pure indica like
the, the, he had crossed them too,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were smoking like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super high CBD, CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just like the, uh, there's very
valuable shit now because that's the meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some, if you want to start
circulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't have, uh, I've got a ton of
them in old, uh, film canister,
[SPEAKER_01]: the old 35 millimeter pistol.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that went in the freezer,
that's how it froze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all of my old stock went to those
old 35 millimeter film canister,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have one and my partner has one and
they both just say Rudy, Rudy's on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, we cracked it open and have
gone into a multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does just instantly grow them single
stocky as cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's interesting shit though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the, none of them that have been
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pop every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, near, near 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a string of, um, wicked,
tough, Tiberian cross ship from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, original cause the photos and the only
photo that Neville used that were not his
[SPEAKER_01]: own was from D and it was the photo in
like 1990, uh, CBN catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was advertising his, uh,
ruderalis hybrid crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing was, uh, a polar,
a polar, uh, polygraph from B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it shows just up at the back of
the catalog shows a, let me see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: offering was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the Indica ruderalis
Indica thing, but, um, he said he has the
[SPEAKER_01]: original stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the original stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ruderalis skunk in the picture
shows, uh, and it says it to ruderalis
[SPEAKER_01]: Polaroid snapshot from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so he's been growing this,
this exact stock since 1980s, because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is from the 1999, 1990 catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me he had been inbreeding it
and just growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it finishes and kicks ass and is
potent and is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said originally it was just sleepy
weed, but they had geared it now towards
[SPEAKER_01]: taste effect, um, still got the super
resistance and durability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he was going to send me some
of it, but he sent me about 10 other
[SPEAKER_01]: things and not that, and then he said he
would resend it, but I'd lost contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he disappeared off IG and I don't
even, I don't know how the hell I guess we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking only on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless, he has the ruderalis and
the auto that might work up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photo autos are the only thing that do
real well up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get something like a Colombian
photo auto with the fastest, best Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have the Pustritus resistance and
still finish it about 75 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing you got to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do with that shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody does like, if you're going
outdoors up here, there's only a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: choices, you know, autos that don't do
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a roof, find it like a
greenhouse with screened walls,
[SPEAKER_01]: just screen them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has ton of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll finish your autos or you,
uh, everybody grows autos in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fucking silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 hours of light indoors, wasting all
that time, energy and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to get offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, it's everybody can do their own
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not against any one form, but also one
thing people do up here is grow them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the windowsill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you got a good sunny window,
that'll get you by with some autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can finish off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works pretty well because we have
the, you know, 18 and 20 hours of sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and those things are just jamming in
your window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way, but they're,
you know, so protected environment of your
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your house plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing about that auto
triggering blueberry that I have fast
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it's one of the lines of
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a root restrictive root zone
restriction, uh, flowering response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just put it in a solo cup,
all of your males and females,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to sex it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it in that solo cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the third, fourth week,
you're actually going to see males showing
[SPEAKER_01]: and that you can just separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a dead locked in trait,
but it's pretty damn accurate and pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can almost just pull all your
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to kill them, kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do, you know, keep them in
solos, put them somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're going to continue to flower
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, do you just deal with them,
but you know what your females are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just repot them up and you get
these just killer females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you want to male, you just
repot it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just go back into full veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be blowing out balls everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoors, it's about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird to strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a photo auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be because if you don't,
uh, shave the legs completely stripped it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the auxins are going to make this thing go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you strip the legs and put a huge
root ball, uh, root, give a good root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone, it's going to go to full veg and veg
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be a regular a hundred percent
normal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to root bind a good
female, you can put it in your window seal
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll act like an auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll get a very nice, tight,
smokable killer blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can smell the thing growing the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they make a house plant, an auto house
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fast blueberry is really an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting screen and it triggers
out there maybe 10 days faster than your
[SPEAKER_01]: regular outdoor blueberries, which finish
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, but this one will, people have
told me they finish it in like middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: September and they can get it done before
October weather starts to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good thing up here or
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that the Iranian autos were like
that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's in the genetics or if
it was just got a little bit of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, the auto ruderalis type of
genetics in it or I know there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's probably about 10 variations of,
uh, cannabis between the Chinese,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, ruderalis is the,
um, sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to be through
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have made photo autos of
their own, which are just a slight degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lean in one way or the other,
you know, the expressions will tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: that coming up and asked by some pretty
thoughtful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, they're like,
putting a lot of thoughts in their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell me that they actually think that
cannabis is a perennial because it is one
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can grow forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be biennial annual or,
or perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's thought to be the only per annual
in the world out of 6,000 annuals that has
[SPEAKER_01]: a male and a female to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minus the fact that I think a radish is
very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I know Ed Rosenthal had brought
up some stuff on that, that it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not the only out of 6,000,
but other people have argued that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to get into that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is very, very special for the
fact that out of every annual you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, they're, they're all asexual and
cannabis is like that one expression
[SPEAKER_01]: alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at all the different
lines through thousands of years that have
[SPEAKER_01]: come down for whatever purpose they were
using it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, they've and regionally too,
it's one of the best things in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is it's got every single
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through development, this can,
it's going to go to crazy places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was undeveloped natural
occurrences happening to do what it does
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little human intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we just now hit the same humans
that weed has been around the prehistoric
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, you know, marijuana fucking
fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my mind were rolling here thinking
about all this weird shit with our,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our, our 20 hours of light up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to, you don't get a fair
chance on, you know, America.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have these plants, they get them
vegged out and make them to huge bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: and baby them and put them in,
you know, 600 gallon pots or in real
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor ground or whatever the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts to flower or start to
show hairs June, July, and we're at 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 21 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, we just kind of get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to grow some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just did auto trigger and regular
photo, uh, photo cannabis without doing
[SPEAKER_01]: light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having trouble in your grill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your plants aren't looking as good
as you know they could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any experienced grower will tell you that
the number one thing that's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants growing to peak performance is
keeping a stable environment and staying
[SPEAKER_00]: within VPD range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're anything like me,
you can't afford a two to $300
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coconut's got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the low price of 69 42,
you can pick up your very own coconut meat
[SPEAKER_00]: soup, humidity, temperature, and VPD
charting with real time pushed app
[SPEAKER_00]: notifications will send notifications
directly to your phone, keeping you in
[SPEAKER_00]: tune with your grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to coconut.com use code calyx
for 10% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's C-A-L-Y-X for 10% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let your grow get the best of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the best of your grow with coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to get into those
blueberries with you because that's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: part of what you do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but while we're talking about the
original SSSC strains, you said you got
[SPEAKER_00]: permission to reproduce these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that we can expect here
in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had actually, uh, those came from old
Detroit, all out of his freezers,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the SSSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave him back, you know,
a good portion of seeds, like a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: of each one after I did the reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a super good old guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like 73 or 74 running a medical co-op
type of deal and right outside Detroit,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's like, he's in it for the long
haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just did that Nigerian candahar in last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had just brought that out of the
freezer, did a huge grow out, did a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: repopulation of it, and then put the stock
right back in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody wants a bunch of
people were looking for that Nigerian
[SPEAKER_01]: candahar in pure form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, that's good shit that he
can just break it out if he wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them on their own are great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had permission to reproduce the seed
bank catalogs that were copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have some of those original SSSC
types too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have reproductions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have four productions of a bunch of
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Durban, DTHF, which I got from the
Flying Fish Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Durban had for a fucking god dang
month of Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those other ones I've only recently
had for a few years, the Beatrix and the
[SPEAKER_01]: William Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that people should check
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Williams Wonder grows beautiful,
like Afghani, dark green, stout,
[SPEAKER_01]: thick, tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows just killer, nice frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows good outdoors, indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can get a little botrytis because the buds
are four inches thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't even fry, the buds will
get huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have air movement or a roof over
them, son of a bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of cold weather resistance
testing up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fuckers will rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never did throw that Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recently, I've got a couple of
people that I just gave them, give it back
[SPEAKER_01]: to where they're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was my favorite and this and that,
you know, what's interesting about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Williams Wonder is the man who invent,
not I'm going to say invented,
[SPEAKER_01]: but bred the Williams Wonder is nobody
really knew him or knew the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Carl says that they got the strain
in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The originator of Williams Wonder made it
in Williams, Oregon in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he used to live in Santa Cruz and he
was like 18 in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved up to Williams, but he brought
all his Santa Cruz stock, which at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time was like Mexican imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you're only going to get so
much shit that was coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he met a grower in Williams who had a
solid line of Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all it was called was Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they crossed what he said was O'Hawken
that he brought up from Santa Cruz,
[SPEAKER_01]: his original O'Hawken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen the pictures of this
fucking cat at 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how people look?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a badass motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he almost looked like a Santa
Cruz weed pirate or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then such an honor to meet all cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like 75 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to meet him.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name's Dave Stanley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in fucking Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, over in Williams, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you know, he's a tough fucker
chopping wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow gets deep as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a tough summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a dumb bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he grew the Williams again because I
gave it back to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time since he'd lost the seed stock,
he'd go to he'd go to Hawaii in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he'd go to Hawaii and spend a
couple of months over in the islands and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring like a case of weed, go to the
condo, chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the seed stock in a jar and fucking
mice got into it, killed it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the last trips to Hawaii,
but prior trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that, when he was still super into it
and having the seed stock in production,
[SPEAKER_01]: he met Willie Nelson over there and him
and Willie Nelson got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, got together, get it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have a fucking suitcase full of
weed trading out their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But will Willie Nelson really like David's
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want shit load of seed.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next year, when they met up in Hawaii,
Willie Nelson had a suitcase full of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking weed and they break it out and
laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I call Willie's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking the Williams wonder
seed reproduced from fucking directly
[SPEAKER_01]: direct connection to fucking Willie
Nelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right out of Dave Stanley's fucking
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a ton of stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talk to these old guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get on the phone and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: The honor to fucking hear any of these old
stories and get some information from the
[SPEAKER_01]: old guys, because they're not going to be
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're around for very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't hear it, nobody would say
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: His son owns Ziploc seeds and he would say
that my dad invented Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anybody ever fucking
once heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my my biggest experience with it
has been the crosses that P did with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a great work with that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some of my favorite shit I've grown
from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remade a couple of crosses,
the Williams wonder to my vintage
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of like the opposite of what,
you know, he had made the Blue Magoo Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Magoo, DJ Sork's blueberry and Williams
wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the opposite male with female
backwards deal, but it was the SSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 I used my vintage blueberry,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is and good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: His come out different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew this Blue Magoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew a certain way and did a certain
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine does something else, but it's it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ones I think should be bronze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful and smokes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote the Blue Magoo back cross twice
a lot, and I think you would be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Chris told me the other day that he's
about to release the or maybe already has
[SPEAKER_00]: the back cross three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that back cross is way heavier
on the Williams wonder side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really resembles that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always working, so he puts in the
work and you know, I know I know for a
[SPEAKER_01]: fact he did get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of his blueberry is the same
blueberry I use when we get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the best blueberry that he's ever
found, and that's what he claims the best
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetest blueberry he's found is the
Kinnick Goose Bay blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from friend of mine up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is greedy away K legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: KK legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he had the you know about 20 years
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it use Bay Blueberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right where he lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his house right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it use Bay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became pretty good brand name shit,
even though it was black market days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a sought after brand name.
[SPEAKER_01]: People went for KGB.
[SPEAKER_01]: KGB has always been a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, killer green, but the fucking
KGB is a fucking term that's been locked
[SPEAKER_01]: in up here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will call it Goose Bay,
but there's I've heard that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian Goose Bay blueberry too,
so it's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably a local blueberry of
Canada had a shitload of it has got a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard the Kinnick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the Goose Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard just regular Canadian blueberry
on a blueberries over there like the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother of berries was basically down from
like a good blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's so many good berries like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did cross the mother of berries made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a shitload of that mother of
berries and 907 blue jeans and 907 blue
[SPEAKER_01]: jeans is the connect Goose Bay blueberry
to my vintage blueberry is probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: My best great go to sweet blueberry that
907 blue jeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just great get a handful of girls
out of that every time that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to go through five of them
and flip a coin and have a couple people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke out on him to get a.
[SPEAKER_01]: A one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I revenge four or five every time I'll
pick like all of those S1 for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these four are right there with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fuck it will rerun it and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That mother of berries is real
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuller big old nice fruity big dogs and it
has green leaf and in the calyxes at about
[SPEAKER_01]: six weeks they start turning purple inside
so the bud turns colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on the vintage.
[SPEAKER_01]: No mother of berries on the murder rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how it's weird how certain plants
have some purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will have purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they turn purple like Anna or say
gooey breeder of the guy and exotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean he he'll have purple cord buds that
just are naturally purple that start up at
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three weeks in and the
motherfuckers turn purple from the core on
[SPEAKER_01]: up and then other ones have purple in
different ways and they'll have purple
[SPEAKER_01]: patio purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vein down the middle of the leaf vein and
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start to purple up that way later on and
some of purple leaf and then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: green inside the whole but it'd be a
purple exterior from maybe photo synthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: or cooling and those purples express one
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so weird how the purpose probably
four or five different expressions and
[SPEAKER_01]: purples some have a purple underskirt some
won't have any some will be a purple top
[SPEAKER_01]: and green bottom somewhat fucking purple
top and purple bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the best thing about the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get I get crazy about combinations and
wanting to bring out the expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my mind's like I'm going to do this and
I'm going to do this and oh man I can
[SPEAKER_01]: target some shit but it's so there's so
much more can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think one of the best ways that
I've ever heard is when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it's it's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the painter and you're going to
create it you know within your vision of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a good handle on breeding because my
whole life I've been a spread animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at a very very early age I say sixth
grade I had meat rabbit breeding project
[SPEAKER_01]: that was making me money because you know
as a kid I was pretty damned enterprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked I worked and I did shit to make
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was one thing I learned was
breeding rabbits right quick on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then through future farmers of
American vocational agriculture courses
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and in school I learned a lot
about breeding animals and learned how to
[SPEAKER_01]: cast great pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know we did that shit right in
class cast great fucking pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got one chance at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to bleed your pig but that
you got to do that shit right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went did judging a little bit of
judging as apprentice judge it like a
[SPEAKER_01]: different eight fair playing around with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned you know learn all of the cow
breeds all of the chicken breeds all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pig breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then there was like 40 cows 30 30
fucking pigs or 20 pigs and 30 chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's like hundreds of fucking each
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you couldn't keep up on the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did American Bulldogs from 87 on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I saw my first in like 84 saw a guy
called American Standard Pit Bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biggest baddest fucking dog I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't a pit bull terrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no terrier in these dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a native guy American Indian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah the wicked fucking Brendal and
white badass patched up Bulldogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like I thought five years I was
thinking man that's the baddest dog I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just call it American Standard Pit
Bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 89 I got into researching them in 87
my one original girl my partner's cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has one of these dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a couple of them called suds and
scratch and suds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to go over to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did construction work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just like moved us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent his fucking bike over there his
hot rod Camaro 68 Camaro and take all his
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd work over there six months at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left me his dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were they were something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of that year I went to I
wouldn't targeted American Bulldogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like they're called American
Standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was once called Bowie the Johnson
Bulldog line the American Standard or Alan
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was old southern white
lines and then there was country bulldog
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized man they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Johnson Bulldog has English Bulldog in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a hundred and at the time 140
pound just like bird machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other ones are working Bulldogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be catching doing cattle cattle
herding pig catching straight up utility
[SPEAKER_01]: farm work of every fucking base shape and
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the country bulldogs there was
cracker bulldogs down in fucking Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know they do work with these
dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your silence got to the originator of the
standard bulldog you do like wild cattle
[SPEAKER_01]: roundups on islands down in Florida swamps
and use these bulldogs for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get the dogs and they're a fucking
mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: There ain't one of them that's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have bad hips dysplasia they have
entropic eyes ectropic eyes bad elbow
[SPEAKER_01]: mange both demodectic and scarpotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my God they're a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth of what you understand about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have like brachycephalic
fucking throats like the Frenchies and the
[SPEAKER_01]: English Bulldogs and some have clear
throats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weed through this shit and have every
expression of a dog coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like poly hybrids of poly
hybrids of poly hybrids like the current
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking scene that is today in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to get some normality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started doing a massive amount of
testing for hips and skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went with pen hip which is University
of Pennsylvania and the OFA Orthopedic
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation of Animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vet at Hillside Wellness Center here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took my money for a lot of times 200 to
300 tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've done 60 70 tests and I'd get
to be involved with it because I'd be the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that would distract the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the dog anesthetize them put them
on a ventilator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to extract the pen hip is actually
popped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just place their fucking hips and you
do this with hundreds of pounds of force.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spread them on a table pop their hips
out a fucking joint and measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another one where you press them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put their hips together put your knees
together and press in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another one where you
stretch them out lengthwise and that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: OFA view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through all these combinations of
fucking views and calculations and four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five different vets determine that the
dog's got a rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pen hip rating and OFA does rating
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's OFA excellent and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only like one or two American
Bulldogs ever made the OFA excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway I was I got him up good enough
to where I produced OFA excellent dogs and
[SPEAKER_01]: there wasn't many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I produced one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the OFA rating from like 80
percentile which was loose as shit 80 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 90th percentile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loose as shit dogs going to be crippled
from dysplasia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got it down to the 10th percentile
and we were fucking jamming all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have no more fucking ectropic
eyes and trophia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did fucking grandfather to
granddaughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did brother half brother to half sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: I inbred his only way I could clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I inbred fresh where I didn't want to
fucking you know you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: straight father.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people that have winning
champion dogs they are they do father to
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter and do a ton of inbreeding and
ton of it and they lock that shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to lock down any of your
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a perfect dog you could do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you ain't going to fucking do that
with a dog that has issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep a somewhat fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway I'd get a co-efficiency on my
dogs where I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd carry them down to you know big
confirmation shows or put the confirmation
[SPEAKER_01]: show at a protection tournament testing
and training and certification and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this for working dogs or something called
the Working American Bulldog Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did titling and testing and there was
tons you know schutz and there was a PSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all protection sports that are
hard for KNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of these motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd go down there dogs right off the
couch from Alaska and go wild boar hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: at night because it was in regions like
you know the show at Watsonville
[SPEAKER_01]: California and Salinas is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right the main center of wild boars
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends that are true dogmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in books about this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking famous true dogmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take me on the biggest ranches in
California still to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got I got invite to go on on
billionaires fucking properties to hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: these pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this guy's got eight key and key
codes for places where the it's insane
[SPEAKER_01]: what he can get into to go pig hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you telling me about that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go on to his ranches and pig hunt at
night and show up at that confirmation
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hunt all night and we'd smack some
pigs and I'd get the dog boxes like a
[SPEAKER_01]: rental truck perch rental truck or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'd put the pig on the dog box
put the stick in his mouth where the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking tusks are sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd roll through the dog show at about 11
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already rolling start maybe about 10
getting very active already doing
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmation and all this bullshit
protection and just shows and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: crap is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I roll through and every one of those
motherfuckers have to turn and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that ball on the back of my deal and then
I'd run back to the ranch with that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the meat cooler run over to the.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never once slept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd show back up at the show with the
bulldogs that caught the damn pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made our mark in the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd call me that asshole from Alaska
because I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you know an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just louder and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on coffee and I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfiltered unfiltered you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we help we put our mark and I go
down to Texas and they might get your ass
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of guys down there a little bit
tougher thing to take it like California
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd get mouthy down there and I'd have
four or five guys in the fucking together
[SPEAKER_01]: in a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know thinking I'm going to get
into a fight over the shit but I'd hold my
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd steal a couple of their confirmation
points where they couldn't champion their
[SPEAKER_01]: dog out and go back to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that saying multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did grand champion dogs out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make dogs that were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I improved it one up to where I made dual
grand champion dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won seven best in shows with one female.
[SPEAKER_01]: A female show with a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're beating the other strain of dogs a
bully dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your class.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're beating the next class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you meet beat the best male in that
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you beat the best male in that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking best in show with a female
seven fucking times in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you've gone somewhere with the
dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a lot of work though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that gave me a straight up idea how to
give me a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing cannabis the whole time besides
breeding pigs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fucking pig breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to straight semen farms just get pigs
do all my own AIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alaska saw Alaska's pig stock sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hit up that guy I told you
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to yesterday but it didn't come
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna send you that profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put in the farmer underscore fly and
nothing came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the fly farmer and the flying
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you his profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure you guys get connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the rabbit hole of looking for this
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta get me some damn Shetland
chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are getting along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lucky as hell because that's a near
extinct strain of chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main interest in breeding cannabis a
lot of it is a one time thing I happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody collected it and fucking
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some guys collecting shit in Nepal in
77.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna fucking preserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it don't come out pure to itself I'm
gonna process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something they would express good with it
or whatever but that's how I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I hear Shetland chicken is almost
extinct in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blue egg layer which the genetics
originally comes from South America by way
[SPEAKER_01]: of Spaniard coquistadors going up into
Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This genetics finally ends up because the
only blue eggers in the world is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Shetland chicken and the fucking cream leg
bar and that's like a Sussex England.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have Shetland chickens this year I'll
probably have my chicken fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be done with chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what he's got but I
know his main focus is chickens and pigs
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you said that name the other day
I've heard it before and I think he'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: the only person that ran that by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I ordered up 15 fucking cream leg or
opal leg bars this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just came into America in like 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these chicken strains have never
come to America.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had been banned from importation and
a lot of them are fucking Dutch,
[SPEAKER_01]: German, English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green fire farms is one that brought in
most of these really killer lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The French Marins and the leg bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're getting distributed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the elite cannabis cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: One person finds it, develop it,
gets the word out and it spreads out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each person that gets it if it's not on
lockdown they do whatever they want with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people would bootlegg it at a
quarter of the price or give it out or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the chickens have come that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know $5,000 chicken a few years ago is
now you can get $30 set of hatching eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: on eBay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's reroute really quick back to
the blueberry because I don't know about
[SPEAKER_01]: you but I'm about to light up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never asked is that what you were
smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which blueberry was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes yes the one that we can yeah
gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am about to light up right now one of
the collaborations that you did with the
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the gooseberry blueberry crossed into
that grapefruit we were just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made a couple of cool crosses like the.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that that gooseberry blueberry to his
cheese BX.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking through it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll put off that blueberry
cheesecake because this cheese is really
[SPEAKER_01]: good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that he worked hard to get on and
working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blueberries a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking get that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet good ass blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucking Tenet gooseberry blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have to fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can target it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely added to the grapefruit in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, could that like the
grapefruit web of his was a super killer
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruity deal and when I crossed it to
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad ass from Ice River Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking killer plant still not as
45 day fast or 50 day fast as the pure
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit web.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had fucking double that grapefruit
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one still retain the grapefruit,
but that blueberry added so much bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal and color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also add the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to think it added juice flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the other thing is that
blueberry didn't get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit, but it did accent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's definitely got a heavy blueberry
there, but it's playing along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to be more grapefruit like we're
saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go grab a fucking 20 year old
kind of a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grapefruit web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapefruit badass crosses that I got all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they all, you know, BX a little bit on
the older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that island sweet skunk one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to manage plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows six inches a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grew it in the greenhouse for
at first from hit the eight foot mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized I was fucked, so I flowered the
damn thing to anyone trying to control
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics on that runaway bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to generally squat
everything or put 50% or more in that
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll like it'll show its influence really
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fairly well inbred Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the island sweets gunk it over ran the.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one so well started play 25 seeds two
or three days ago of that island sweets
[SPEAKER_01]: come in at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've encountered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that island sweet skunk pretty
fucking short plant to begin with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it branched out pretty bushy fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is old original genetics here and
it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, be on my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's known.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's saying it's the part of the wildest
thing he fucking houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things that were like that for me
were really good was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like oh seven, I got a hold of space Jill
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew also chocolate, the original D line
that was it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fucking space, Joe and D line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm indoors growing this shit and I
read the write up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the few times in the world I
get on those forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've I've researched this and I
got to have that then I go grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were warning that if you don't
the chocolate, it was like they said four
[SPEAKER_01]: foot minimum height and don't grow it
under lights or you get overrun and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I heard I did 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's solid went to four fucking
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a serious, big, long coal of
biomass, not out of control, but man,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is what they said 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the space Joe did grow six inches a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had it tuned in and it was feeding
and had root zone, you could dwarf it for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure and try to keep it a little bit slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I call a biomass producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost an out of control fucking
indoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you have a heart and she is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's trying to reproduce right now or go
back to any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of her original space, Jill, most as she
can to Vick I's gift that that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's running through her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was a few packs of it actually left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to wholesale for them and I've
bought hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of fucking packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just running the shit out of their
gear just because I was getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how that wholesale and I could
just run through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's trying to reproduce her original
space queen or space Jill right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The space bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she's going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packs of space bomb, which was the last
space Jill production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody has original pace,
Jill acts or original old, old,
[SPEAKER_01]: old fucking space queen, you know,
kick that shit to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a help around a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We that original space still was fucking
damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for space, Jill,
not Space Queen, or is it the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: either one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, most you know, the space dude,
the male version of Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what fucking like all of his
breeders produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything came out of that one fucking
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original space Jill seeds I got was
like the fucking F1 right off F1 issue or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like different, you know,
weed changes and everybody breeds it going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a slightly different expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three environments later,
it's not the fucking same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they never kept a clone ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they would do is grow from seed every
single generation because they didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: room to keep this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to see generational shift,
but it's fucking changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So original space Jill was a fucking good
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some of the things I crossed back
in like 07 and 08 was like I made truffle
[SPEAKER_01]: oaks, which was, you know, just D line and
space Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't going to be like, you know,
really good, strong killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go through that,
that chocolate trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those old things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chocolate chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to catch a fish?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put chocolate on that damn book
because there ain't enough chocolate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried that Escobar's chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the chocolate trip with
Escobar's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody send me a package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't germ.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't germ for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing some chocolate tie right now,
but I gotta have a few pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that's what I'm getting mixed up
is the chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did go through the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to grow the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's not enough good chocolate
tie chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want one that's like the one when I I
smoked a lot of pot when I was very young,
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years old, cause there was like there
was a guy around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then people were just so different
and chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: People on the radio with like the Eagles
and tuck and people were like chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much different, but a guy was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a bunch of ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't call it ounces of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's buying lids of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: He seed it, destem it and roll joints for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like at like 10 years old,
very nimble fingers, very fucking good at
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would give it funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was using those the old zigzag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wheat papers which were yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would he would tell everybody that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody nothing causes cancer except the
paper in the in the thing, and he would
[SPEAKER_01]: say that wheat papers didn't cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's $5 a lid and $10 a lid or,
you know, import weed, which was generally
[SPEAKER_01]: brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it wasn't super compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they I would roll the shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was it coming from at that time for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, that was in Oregon,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it was just I don't know where the
fuck it would have been coming from when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was in Washington a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could direct I knew where it was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of Mexican import straight
through the Columbia River when I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where they didn't or came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right at when I started getting into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right at that time where most of it
was Mexican, but we had just started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some like good green buds and kind
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we never saw that back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the pure original fucking
paraquatish type of old fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican half of it had dirty had some crap
in it and wasn't good, but it was cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, yeah, when this was like got
to be a 78 or something is and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what the deal was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd give me like two joints if I rolled
up like 30 and get about get about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: joints out of a out of one of them lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was rolling the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did like go grab his six joints and go
give me a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me and my friend would like go smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such poor fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to know that it really got us
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get about as high as fucking tobacco
because I got super I got spun out from
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco at that point hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it was equal to some tobacco
high and I didn't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got I've got to ask you a question
back then way beyond my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you smoking the seeds in your joints?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I knew to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why that guy was having me roll
this because he didn't want to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking amount of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to fucking DC the lid of that weed,
you know, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds were seeds were give you a straight
up fucking headache and it'd be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, popping and fizzing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I tried to smoke fucking seeds
at one or two times desperation as a child
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking after I already knew what we was
without a weed, but I could go to get high
[SPEAKER_01]: off the seeds and tried to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how, you know, at 1011,
it's like I realized that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, it's like oil, pure oil and
bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had been smoking the crappy joints
and I babysit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is in about 80s and about 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: I babysit my mother's friends,
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're about 12 years old,
about 12.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're not their bikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think bikers are pretty hardcore
people, but they had some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can call a tie bun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was on a fucking stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like on a actual literal bamboo
stick laced with like a fucking string
[SPEAKER_01]: from the whole length of the main stem,
the apical stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like hemp string, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what that shit was all bound up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let they tell me I could smoke
some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom was pretty liberal because she
that's how I ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was her friend that I was rolling all
the joints from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, they would go out on a
Saturday night, go to some live jams at
[SPEAKER_01]: some country fucking bars and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, well, you can smoke a
joint if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shit would just never get me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I babysit to these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, well, here's a little bit of pot
if you want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So untied it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I untied the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crumbled it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rolled a fucking joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took about three hits and it hits me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing hit me is the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was original real chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually had fucking like licorice
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking delicious, just almost like
an incense type of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that weed hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember two to three hours
fucking of the whole fucking event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have never been taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people are crazy if they let some
fucking 12 year old smoke and watch kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't care about their fucking kids
because I literally lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crime portal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aliens could have fucking grabbed me that
out that three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I fucking never then I got high from
then on that trigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It triggered in me that weed made me high
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew what levels of the strength was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the times at first, if you smoke,
it really does not affect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smoked, I didn't get high
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was said shit weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if a fucking sixth grader gets
ahold of the Mac right now, I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they fucking got off school but
smoked one hit of that shit and went to
[SPEAKER_01]: the shed and they found them sleeping in
the shed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the difference in what we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That little bastard just looks you in the
eye and says, I didn't feel nothing,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, funny shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the whole reason I asked behind that
is because one day we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember who was involved,
but my old man was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I remember some of that first
stuff that we were buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Mexican stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd put it on a paper plate,
grind it up, you know, and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tap the back of the plate and let the
seeds fall out from the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my old man, he's about your
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, fuck, we just rolled that shit
and smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so much seed weed that me and my
partner, it's a running joke with us that
[SPEAKER_01]: we miss one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take the drag and you start to
know it's starting to burn, you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly know and you just like get it
puff and just a tiny bit more and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it's like scorching and then just
pass it to that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're about to get that firecracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: True story here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, at 17, Bernardino, my buddy Falcon
Falcon are showing me around and meet
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody about industry or
strange or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brings me over to fucking J.J.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: and fucking Mr. Soul were sharing a booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know J.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: and did no sour diesel or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew J.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: because this guy, this guy bought 100,000
plus worth of fucking packs from all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these briefings.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd get like three drops and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he brings us me and he came over and
over to J.J.'s booth and introduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, hey, you want to smoke a
joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: He rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our diesel and about and we're hitting it
like, you know, four of us, five of us.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second round, then big old pop
goes off the first burst and like a
[SPEAKER_01]: volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Adam, you all laugh and
this kind of shit, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, my God, I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, let me roll another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to taste it before I fucking did
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We walked off and we were laughing a
little bit and shit and just like super
[SPEAKER_01]: comical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't remember if it was fucking
Falcon or a fucking result.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pop dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had never smoked that sour diesel
before that fucking 17 right then and
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke his.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know shit about diesels before
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked a few different diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a bunch of taco and AJ's and
Albany and what the fuck might have been
[SPEAKER_01]: another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had never been a big diesel fan
before, but it's pretty good if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: have that as like one of 10 or 15 in a
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going out fishing and then you
smoke like five or one type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just want to go off a whole
different scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You break out a diesel joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesels are by far one of my favorite
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just the way that they affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of a trade off because a lot
of diesels can grow like motherfucker,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you ever got the chance to
try P's huckleberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is huckleberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only grown like half a dozen things
in his pineapple fields, the caramel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that one's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it caramel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm at Hayes because it had the
fucking confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the blue magoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a bunch of shit when we first
met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I grew, I think,
and liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most is the the huckleberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original platinum huckleberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very original fucking incarnation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one that's so O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like any of the others in the
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would get that out of the F1 for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd get a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you found it, it was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changed a lot after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people did different selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so weird how one pack can put off
nine of one expression and one of another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy keeps it and that whole line is
that line and the other go do different
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the one I keep right now,
we call it the Kirkland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's fucking my buddy Captain
Kirk fucking houses it all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a fucking mainstay go to for fuck
at least five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking such a consistent good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down there to carry that shit down
to Emerald and it'd be you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might carry three types.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all whatever time period in the
world it was with gorilla glue fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: wave or O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: wave or cookie wave or gelato wave or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would walk through that smoke cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just common as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Emerald about 18 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm carrying that purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was carrying purple Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good one that I got from the nature
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking killer old shaft stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old, old, old mid 20s old kind of purple
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would hold its own and that this
is fucking platinum Uncle Barry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hold its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pre-roll joints to that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be meeting strangers, being super
social, like being at some phone drop or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's over there doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd be like sitting down,
chilling, smoke a joint and a stranger
[SPEAKER_01]: come along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to meeting and talk to them and
they take a rip off of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, Oh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the fucking is that no,
that's Christmas platinum Uncle Barry
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that just that really unique certain
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's slightly different
variances because we used to do a three
[SPEAKER_01]: years later, got a V three pack of the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he told me it was like way slower
veg, way faster, but way more Uncle Barry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowest veg in the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a bunch of like trifoliate type of
growth out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a super squat biomass pig.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't like take off leaves and
take off leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ran that thing two or three runs
and they were all the same, super slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower and was it nothing like the
original that we keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people up here that are friends
of his, the East frog botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They consistently run a super killer cut
of that platinum Uncle Barry cookies of
[SPEAKER_01]: his also.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a rec market down in Homer,
it's a little down 240 miles south of here
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the Enide peninsula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a real small community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the places they grow and
have dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got the market handle growing
Chris's shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost all exclusively what they
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really cool that they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this Homer has a lot of fucking
dynasty here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can fucking honestly say that you go to
a dispensary at home or you're fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: buying Chris's shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the capital halibut of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fucking town is known as the capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the halibut capital of the world
is called the end of the road or end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's like, it's the end of the
fucking peninsula there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drive right out to the ocean to the on
the spit towards the straight water that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't been to their, hadn't been to
their operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know fucking sure the husband of the
couple that runs it, he's a boat and fool
[SPEAKER_01]: like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fishing ocean, killing fools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of my patrons have been asking
about your skunk cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any new plans to do anything
with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, I've done it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I made that straight up in Oh
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's what is now like fucking,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 years or 14 years or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it a long fucking time, but I did
just break out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some recent frozen, uh, frozen seeds that
actually didn't have skunk cabbage written
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still said, uh, I'm fucking crazy train
and D line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're one of the first generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is at some,
I don't even know what the fuck it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're prior to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I started calling it skunk
cabbage at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I used to call it a one,
but I already had too many ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I'm doing 50 or so feeds,
I'll go eight through Z and then one
[SPEAKER_01]: through whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I find the female search,
I have all that shit written down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classifying was what's best one
through five and fucking funny and shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but two or three times the number a one
ends up popping up as being the best
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper phenyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't keep calling shit a one and
there's other ones in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body has maybe a haze, but you know,
but body I think has a haze called a one
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people confuse mine and they go,
what were this and that, that no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, my a one's fucking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, it was a number, but number
six runs in my fucking lines too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got four different things that ended
up being number six.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my Americana, the, um,
fucking ice Afghani, the GST, which was,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, originally I call it Jackson skip
originally strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got from a 83 year old dude here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in bad health right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into a car accident and,
uh, been a year in the hospital with a
[SPEAKER_01]: broken back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now he's wheelchair bound,
but he's still growing the fucking GST,
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy that originally produces with his
old crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty, uh, pretty tough old cat,
but he's, he's going downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to think he doesn't fucking,
uh, if he can pull out of this shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: his goal is to get out of that wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a good, he's a good old cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and his guys, just like us would have
been with, uh, your little local crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a local strain and they fucking
went through it and they would decide what
[SPEAKER_01]: was what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they picked that thing after
breeding for years and they all stuck with
[SPEAKER_01]: the number six.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he called.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just calls it the number six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get me a cut of that number six?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring one over in a fucking second for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Jackson, old name, Al Jackson.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I call him Jackson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's, he's a good old guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, if you don't hear some of the
old fuckers like that, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me a bunch of cool shit about
Anchorage, um, retro grow days because him
[SPEAKER_01]: and me, he's 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like full 30 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's seen some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went through about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say 83 year olds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a clear mind and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tell you what was what.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through some hard shit and some,
and some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our Patreon shiggity flips.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to know how is your big skunk
and is RKS still on the planning list?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done tons of shit with big
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it preserved in a couple of forms
and it's available pretty much pure big
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like it was, um, it was a commercial
type of strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of them older shit was made
for a regional commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be super strong and you
can find killer ones in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that stock, it was older freezer
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four or five years ago, sent that shit to
Jackson to mean gene and he reproduced a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, the way he's so meticulous,
he listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, when he breeds, he grabbed all the
ones he like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male wise, put them on whatever females,
which were going to be whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he listed what their preferences were
for exhibition of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one or two were like, he said PM was
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stick some plants, other strains and,
and even these bad PM, but one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't even get PMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he, he, you know, noted that shit
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to breed another generation
out in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the ones that said PM resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were a man that made a hell of a
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause big skunk was a PM pig.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew it in door, I'm not PM,
but fucking I've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a big, thick, nice bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at six weeks in you're happy as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at eight weeks in the fucker Wilts a
little bit in Browning and you realize it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a slough right off the fucking plant
before you even kept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd kill it at seven weeks early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fucking time we just had to kill it
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, big skunk is just like in
mainstay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a cross that I like a whole lot of
Americana, which was there, our original
[SPEAKER_01]: NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed the big skunk NL one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Americana's fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I worked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 15,000 fucking seeds of it and
still have, my partner still has a jar of
[SPEAKER_01]: the original 1990 F1 Americana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was like a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big group of 300 of them fucking
seeds and we called off all of the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had about 150 or 120, I'd say real
nice females hold every male.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to make a nice room of
fucking killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, the story five weeks in
or seeing seeds, every fucking where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, what the fuck looking for herms,
no herms get about, you know, 50 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little shorty that fucking grew
up right next to fucking one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: girls, a little spindly single stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking male that, uh, came in light,
did his fucking thing, polluted every girl
[SPEAKER_01]: of 120 of them fuckers or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we just shucked it out,
we got the killer hash and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was really fucking good hash too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have photos of the hash and,
um, I was able to share it with Jack hair
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking Steve Hagar and fucking Jack hair
up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, here's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to not fucking talk about
1 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hours on this, but they're promoting
emperor wears no clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a book that Jack had written and,
uh, Steve Hagar, the editor of high times
[SPEAKER_01]: and him are on tour promoting the book and
they have a symposium up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at our, at our performing arts center
downtown, this full blown shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, everybody went down and fucking
got to listen to the show and listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: them talk and explain the fucking how bad
we have been fucked on hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the beginning, uh, how the whole
thing went down, the benefits that hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: could do the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, he's selling this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we knew already, we're like,
we are nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are like, we are no more pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like revolutionists about this shit
back in fucking the eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are, uh, we're all behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this is like 89 in the summer of
89 and, uh, they get to go visit the
[SPEAKER_01]: different gardens and fucking play around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, I give them a half ounce of
the hash, which was near bubble hash of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that production from the Americana
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we didn't call it Americana back
then, but he, uh, he went on his deal a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days, meeting other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met about the third day and it's like,
I didn't think he ever smoked that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super expansive and it's super
fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it would last the whole time
and he's going to smoke other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He comes in the third day we met up,
he's completely out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asked if he can get any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how he fucking smoked that
shit because it's really, it was that
[SPEAKER_01]: strong, but his tolerance was truly
fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he smoked all the other fucking best
weed that people were displaying for him
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that I gave him on that fucking
killer hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was amazing, but we got to,
uh, there's an, there's an initiative to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize marijuana in 1975.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened was a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name Raven intentionally was arrested with
a couple of joints to go to jail and then
[SPEAKER_01]: fight this in court that he had the right
to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this big battle goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wins in local court goes to the state
Supreme court and wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, what the deal was
they, they ruled that Alaskans have the
[SPEAKER_01]: right to privacy and it would override a
privacy in their own home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it would override a suspected
illegality, the right to have privacy in
[SPEAKER_01]: your home would override the fact that a
cop thinks you're smoking pot indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they write it in the constitution that
it is legal to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can possess marijuana and they wrote it
up as 16 plants and four ounces in your
[SPEAKER_01]: own home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this in 1975.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became a law up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you couldn't transport it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I might not know felony shit for
transportation, but a misdemeanor fine
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't an infraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's still pretty big trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get like fucking 30 to 90 days
or something in thousand dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty hairy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm bigger, the worst and anything over
16 plants and four ounces was turning into
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in 1990, a bunch of really stodgy
people that are starting to move up here
[SPEAKER_01]: from the other places site, it should be
illegal to have marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think, you know, they don't want
their fucking children there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they get a initiative going ballot
initiative enough people to sign it to
[SPEAKER_01]: outlaw marijuana in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we as Patriots, you know,
we all had tri-cornered hats and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, at the time you look in the
eighties, late eighties high times,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going on in Ann Arbor,
Michigan and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these people that are like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protesting and let's make marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's weren't tri-cornered hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like our symbol and kind of
our moniker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Jack is up here promoting his
book emperor wears no clothes and he
[SPEAKER_01]: decides to help with, um, you know,
that kind of help with the fight on the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative, which was going to be in the
November vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make it illegal to vote, but,
uh, I mean, make it illegal to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we were all rallying.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a group of guys from the States,
which did more harm than good because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were all the type that wanted to use wheat
paste and post flyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they did this shit around town on
private property on walls, on electrical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, electrical boxes that are
like city owned and, uh, fence posts and
[SPEAKER_01]: fences and posts like light posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wheat paste and impossible to
fucking get off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did this X lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like doing almost, uh,
environmental, uh, terrorism, shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: damaged more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that go, Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, yeah, I'm going to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the owner of that fucking fence that
tried to scrape the fucking wheat paste
[SPEAKER_01]: flyer off his shit is pissed fucking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super, it became negative more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but during that little rally point,
we, all of us as a huge group got to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the Denny's.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's a, there's a couple of
Denny's up here, but there's one on
[SPEAKER_01]: Bergross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still there today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, regular Denny's they
have a fucking big main like area and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back convention room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we got to go have our meeting or
whatever the fuck it was in the convention
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody at one point decides to
fucking start smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it turned into a full blown
fucking smoke fest in the Denny's
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they served us not, we kept,
they kept ordering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ordered every fucking thing on the
fucking menu and they kept just letting us
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the first known indoor smoke out
that it's probably ever happened fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: up here for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dangerous story for you to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, it's so, it's so normal and
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but at one point it was leaking out,
you know, every time they enter through
[SPEAKER_01]: the conference room doors, the smoke was
just belching out into the fucking main
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point after about three hours,
customers were complaining that the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking smoke was just fucking them up and
they shut us down on the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's the, it's an epic fucking
thing that happened right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were rallying and it was all like
for the cause we ended up losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Losing the initiative fucking to end the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1990, the fucking shit goes illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal to smoke marijuana after fucking
since 1975, we've always had the right
[SPEAKER_01]: just to do it, to grow your own and smoke
your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like super illegal at this point
and fucking snitchy ass neighbors and
[SPEAKER_01]: people that know what you used to do are
going to fucking turn you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DEA is up here thick as fuck
because green merchant just went off and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still fun going on there and bedded
like hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's scary fucking times in Alaska and
somebody fucking who's the, it is illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the fucking constitution with an
initiative ballot that goes to court and
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking they reverse the initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we party, we rally fucking Alaska is
100% fucking legal again to smoke and just
[SPEAKER_01]: shut those fucking whiny, you know,
people that basically hockey moms and call
[SPEAKER_01]: them now they were like soccer moms,
soccer moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up here and you got to call them
hockey moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the, that's who made that
initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like evil marijuana, evil
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a normal fucking non fucking harmful
thing besides the medical aspects is
[SPEAKER_01]: insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weird though, how the evolution of
Alaska has gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concludes the first part of the epic
three hour podcast with AKB Brains.
