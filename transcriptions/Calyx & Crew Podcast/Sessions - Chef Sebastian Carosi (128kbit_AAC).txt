let's welcome our guest, Chef Sebastian
[SPEAKER_01]: Carossi.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Doc?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bit of a different podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cannabis related, but we're kind
of delving into what you do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually extremely excited for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did your interest in working with
cannabis begin?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 50 years old and I grew up in a
household where both of my parents were
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were also both in the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad became a doctor and my mom left the
medical industry and became actually a
[SPEAKER_04]: nuclear physicist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she moved into a different realm of
stressful jobs, but they both continued to
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I grew up, I saw that there
were two people in my life that were
[SPEAKER_04]: successful no problems, had basically
whatever they wanted to work for to get
[SPEAKER_04]: and used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my dad being in the medical industry
would always, you know, he'd always had
[SPEAKER_04]: plants going on, but he always had
something to make out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whether it be something silly
back in the day, like brownies or rice
[SPEAKER_04]: crispy treats, you know, I hate to use
candy and sugar vehicles like that as a
[SPEAKER_04]: topic, but you know, those things were
vehicles for cannabinoids back in the day
[SPEAKER_04]: when that was your level of cooking with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just kind of took that and added it
to my profession as a culinarian and as a
[SPEAKER_04]: chef and just tried to apply it without
being too scientific at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's getting really scientific now
and everybody knows everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet everybody knows everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's the master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody's all this and it's
really, it's kind of a convoluted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't call it an industry because it's
not an industry because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: nationwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sparse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in certain areas and it's controlled
in different ways and nobody's controlling
[SPEAKER_04]: a fucking carrot in all these different
ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why are you going to try to control
cannabis in a different way?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the benefits are highly
different from a carrot versus cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I mean, still, if they're going to
regulate it, they really need to start
[SPEAKER_04]: coming together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because there's people out here,
they're like me who are not looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: the highly processed edibles in the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not looking for the next strain that
is named after a candy bar or a wrapper.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not looking for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like to call real cannabis
consumers and not just end users.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people are in this industry
without drawing a paycheck from a company.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be in an industry if you're just
an end user.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come across that all the time and it
jaded me for a lot of things and it's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of moved me away from a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get these messages all the time from J&S
casting to go and be on the next chopped
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis show and all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't answer any of them because I
need the validity of what I'm doing to
[SPEAKER_04]: shine through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to maybe talk about things a little
bit more openly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ask people, i.e.
[SPEAKER_04]: the larger conglomerates and companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean people in general,
but there are owners and CEOs of these
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that are buying 65,000 pounds of
sugar a month and only buying 20 pounds of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis extract to put into their gummies
and then selling them to the mass market,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is basically my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just so sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want people, and I'm sorry I'm on the
Dennis Miller-style rant here,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I really want people to understand
that the plant is edible from the roots to
[SPEAKER_04]: the tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves are highly nutritional.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest benefits that we found from
cannabinoids and cannabis yet are not from
[SPEAKER_04]: any of the ways that any of us are
consuming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's juicing it and drinking the juice
immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the studies in Israel that were done
in the 60s and now that are done from 2005
[SPEAKER_04]: up are the phytonutrients and then the
availability of what you can get from
[SPEAKER_04]: just, and then auger juicing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another thing everybody's like,
Oh, I'm going to go out and get a juicer
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm going to juice it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to be like, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to have an auger juicer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were juicing wheatgrass because
the centrifugal force of the force driven
[SPEAKER_04]: motor driven juicers are just killing half
of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like we're doing when we're
smoking weed, but I'm not going to stop
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get as many cannabinoids in
my body as I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't eat heavy doses of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people think I eat a lot of
cannabis because I cook with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you notice a lot of my food is based
around raw cannabis and the leaf and other
[SPEAKER_04]: forms of cannabinoids in the recipes and
using the can't, you know, tonight I made
[SPEAKER_04]: a panna cotta with cannabis pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine that's a breeder gave me
a gift of cannabis pollen and it's highly
[SPEAKER_04]: sought after.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some of it goes for 600 bucks for
a quarter gram, you know, if you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder, it could go for more than that,
but it's loaded with protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always see all these chefs and all
these culinarians in my field always
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for the next thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're all looking for like
moose nuts from the Congo of South Brazil,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, something that's like,
people are just going to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I need those moose nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard of those and I need them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chefs are all driven that way,
but yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an ingredient that's readily
available to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be using micro greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be using juicing greens,
salad greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird because I got involved
in the first farm in the country that is
[SPEAKER_04]: USDA and FDA license to sell micro greens,
juicing greens, and salad greens,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, hemp, whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour tsunami is what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew 50 acres and you know,
I only had two chefs in the world buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I got, I got a reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I write for seven magazines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get it to people, even if I have to
send it to you free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's lack of experience and
working with those materials?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's scarce lack of just
lack of knowledge, but yet they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for like, and if I tell them I got
truffles, they're like, Oh, can I get
[SPEAKER_04]: some?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get some?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants the truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw your post the other day about the
truffles and I want truffles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You live close, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here in the next two months,
you come on over this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll pick more truffles than you can
sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to go out and forge with you
and just learn some of your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten extensive knowledge of
cannabis, but I've just never really been
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to the world of mycology as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I would definitely
like to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a mycologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a botanist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone on everything that my family has
kind of handed down to me and just
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever region you go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got it's the things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's loop back on that really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you brought it up from my
understanding, are both your parents
[SPEAKER_01]: Italian immigrants?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of my parents were first generations
born here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your father was the one that got you
into mushroom foraging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandfather Vito, his father.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a truffler.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a forager.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had like 300 acres farm in Rhode Island
when we first came here and we didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: no money, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you wanted to eat,
you either had to grow it or forage it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Americans don't, and I'm not talking
shit about Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an American.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying Americans don't have any,
well, there's no seasons in a grocery
[SPEAKER_04]: store.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go into a grocery store in January and
there's plump tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go into a grocery store in the middle
of July, there's plump tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in February, there's plump
tomatoes, cold storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing is, is that I'm so
scared right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monsanto has registered and copywritten
over 8,500 stranger cultivars of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's paying attention to shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it with all the hemp right
now because they worked cannabis for like
[SPEAKER_04]: the past six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're doing hemp because the hemp
farming is getting so damn big.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people just have to shake off a little
bit of the dropped on their heads and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like just wake up, wake up,
sourcing things, fresh, naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: locally is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, to them that these people need to
focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here to them, if that doesn't
adequate, that that doesn't fit into a
[SPEAKER_04]: drive-through method, then they don't do
it or there's no app for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very glad we did this interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you and I vibe together just
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to touch back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said your grandparents were Italian
immigrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taught you how to forage and work
with these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that you said was that
you use the entire plant from the roots to
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to make RSO or you're
going to make something and you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: grower, you got the roots, those roots,
if they have not, and I'm not a grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never grown weed in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife is, I had, cannot, I murder plants
for a living.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're growing in a basin and it's
say hydroponic and you have roots that
[SPEAKER_04]: touch the basin, between that root and
that basin, that micro space, there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of bacteria that a lot of people don't
know about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So personally, if any roots touch the base
and I wouldn't use it, but any other
[SPEAKER_04]: roots, I would put them in your RSO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put them in your anything I would
make from root to tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: You juice them and do whatever the hell
you can not to waste them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite way to prepare?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to make things like if I'm making
well, so I like to juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to juice them because they're
extremely bitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of parts of the plants
that I like to juice because different
[SPEAKER_04]: areas on the plants and I've done,
I've sat there and juiced like 70 runs,
[SPEAKER_04]: just testing the taste on a few different
strains I had available and a few
[SPEAKER_04]: different methods of juicing, but they're
so damn bitter that you really have to mix
[SPEAKER_04]: them with some plant matter juice to get
them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what I call tip pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollens loaded with all sorts of,
I mean, you think about what pollen is and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the, it's baby flowers floating
around for one flower to the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's already got so many nutrients and
it's loaded with protein, minerals,
[SPEAKER_04]: all sorts of vitamins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those things are necessary and
we're just let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one doesn't scare me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I've been consuming bee
pollen for a long time, so why not go with
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that I'm already working with?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird because the,
I'm developing a recipe for maximum meal
[SPEAKER_04]: magazine right now and it's chocolate
chaga truffles with bee pollen,
[SPEAKER_04]: just a little sprinkle of bee pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a junkie for bee pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love bee pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I appreciate about
your work that I've really been following
[SPEAKER_01]: and been interested in is the fact that
you work with ingredients that are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the ones that I saw you
post about the other day was a gunpowder
[SPEAKER_01]: and can of pickled green strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people don't really know about
gunpowder, but the highest quality green
[SPEAKER_04]: tea in the world is actually graded as
gunpowder green tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like taking healing things that
people don't really know about and people
[SPEAKER_04]: that are a little bit unknown to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, it was so easy being a
chef when you have all these normal things
[SPEAKER_04]: available to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you wanted to work in my kitchen as
a culinarian, first of all, you had to
[SPEAKER_04]: name five apples and I don't mean grocery
store varietals.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also had to name what the things on
the end of a fork were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you, we would start talking about
maybe you'd wash dishes and then maybe you
[SPEAKER_04]: could peel carrots or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to, if you're going to be a
culinarian, you got to know your way up
[SPEAKER_04]: and around everything that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you go to a chef and you're like,
cool, nice dish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it was put together by 3000
people and 20 sets of tweezers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd your salt and pepper come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they look at you and they,
and I, I, uh, hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that story kind of sucks because they
can't even tell you where the fricking
[SPEAKER_04]: song pepper came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet they put it together like this
Noma museum of art and charge you $65 for
[SPEAKER_04]: three little bites.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to stop it somewhere on the
way home and get something to fill you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was never, I couldn't sleep at
night as a chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked for two sitting presidents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked for presidents are cozy of
France.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't cook food for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I went behind the boat house at
Walker point in Maine and smoked weed
[SPEAKER_04]: every day while the Bush family was in
there eating lobsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't feed them a shit,
but I also, I didn't have any political,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no political affiliation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't talk politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do, I had one conversation with
Laura Bush and it was about lobsters and
[SPEAKER_04]: the politics behind lobsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, we've never,
I've never spoken, you know, it was about
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it sucks that all of this has
become Instagrammable because it's all
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of based on elitism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you see people like, and I'm just
going to call it what it is, but you see
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are registered sex offenders
and rapists, like being held an iconic
[SPEAKER_04]: status because they smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that Chad cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're always going to have that
yin and yang, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't, so I can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I turned a lot of people down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like I just broke a contract off
with identity CBD and I started working
[SPEAKER_04]: with them because we developed some
products for the Norwegian Olympic team.
[SPEAKER_04]: We developed a bone broth out of Norway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people don't know that the
owner of identity CBD also owns future
[SPEAKER_04]: roller USA and future roller.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a big player.
[SPEAKER_04]: He owns a couple of other companies too,
but he, he runs, he's business partners
[SPEAKER_04]: with branch now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, I can't,
I can't do anything for you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's a bigger player.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a bigger star.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get more publicity from
putting pictures out of a registered sex
[SPEAKER_04]: offender than you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need to affiliate your name
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought I was weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I kind of have my own,
I stay in my own little situation as much
[SPEAKER_04]: as I can, because all the early cannabis
chefs out there are now all they're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: is peddling products on their Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not peddling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either regurgitated information that
they got from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's none of their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your organic more of,
you know, staying within your own realm of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, especially the work that you've done
just locally, you know, for our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You back in the day, you were doing hemp
vest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were cooking over at hemp vest for the
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really weird that you knew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I, you went to hemp vest for years,
17 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran a kitchen at Seattle hemp vest for
the volunteers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooked meals, 10,000 meals over the five
day period.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also done a few other things for hemp
vest, but again, I got jaded by what I saw
[SPEAKER_04]: that was real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to be really honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of my friends became legal and hemp
vest was long time ago, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my friends, you get a legal cannabis
business and then hemp vest comes to you
[SPEAKER_04]: and says, Hey, can you sponsor the event?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $15,000, you know, or can you buy
food for the event?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this and this and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a $1.8 million a year party.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what year you throw it,
it costs $1.8 million because of the land
[SPEAKER_04]: you got to rent, all the bullshit you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every year, every year there was a
pallet of food that I couldn't give to the
[SPEAKER_04]: homeless.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't give to the needy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't give to the hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made me throw away, but yet five
months earlier, they were begging me to
[SPEAKER_04]: beg my friends for the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: What to feed people with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it got to the point where I wasn't
going to be quiet anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Vivian's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nirvan's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, but it's just,
it'd be so easy to get rid of too there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have hungry people, people that
appreciate that bro, you got hungry people
[SPEAKER_04]: right on the other side of the fence and
you're having to tell them, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that fucking person, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walk, no, I walk right by, see you
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not responsible for none of this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey y'all, here's a bunch of sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom, peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, much respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and I felt, you know, I worked for
in the I five Oh two and the O LCC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked for about 40 companies as a
freelancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in the back door of a lot of places
and I don't sign disclosure agreements
[SPEAKER_04]: with anybody, but it's not my business to
talk about their businesses, but I am
[SPEAKER_04]: really happy staying to myself and just
letting cannabis and psilocybin progress
[SPEAKER_04]: the way that it's going to be with the
lecherous money, hungry vultures,
[SPEAKER_04]: getting their parts first.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I was approached last year in
November by national geographic and sensei
[SPEAKER_04]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to send a team out to forage
for wild psilocybin for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you know, it's cool,
but I've been going to this spot for 28
[SPEAKER_04]: years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shown to me by a pretty important
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized that things are on the cusp
and they're coming twofold and everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, wow, and it's cool and it's hip and
it's like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, I've been picking here
for 28 years, so I don't want you to be
[SPEAKER_04]: too disrespectful of the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, when they left,
they called me back and we're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you guys might want to go get a
COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my wife and I went and got COVID tests
and sure enough, we both had COVID,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that was a hell of a hell of a
surprise from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: National geographic team, but it's weird
how this, so 15 to 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: they looked at me as a chef because I
didn't wear a chef's jacket and I pushed
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetables on my menu and garden grown
foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, you hippie granola
fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's the stuff I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm laughing at myself and now they're
like, Oh my goodness, the organic heirloom
[SPEAKER_04]: grown in no-till soil, carrots,
cosmic grown carrots from blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny how I'm going to,
and this is the, this is a funny thing for
[SPEAKER_04]: me sitting in a cabin deep in the woods is
saying like Ted Kaczynski is that social
[SPEAKER_04]: media has put everything in everybody's
fingertips.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody knows everything now and
makes all these professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Masters of nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Master gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in it three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got two crops down and they're a
master gardener on their profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know chefs were like that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I just hope that we have less candy on
the shelves in dispensaries and pot shops
[SPEAKER_04]: or, you know, whatever you want to call
them these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that the culinary and start
learning how to utilize cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: without using sugar as a vehicle to get
them to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that the government gets a
standardization practice going because if
[SPEAKER_04]: they have a standardization for what
organic is, then they can surely have a
[SPEAKER_04]: standardization for what cannabinoids are
and what form they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the five forms that are
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can fucking use what you can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what you can sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything outside of that's the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like people that are going to
get in the carrot market and start selling
[SPEAKER_04]: as carrot dust because it's, you know,
carrot dust.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some people that'll be fooled
with the as seen on TV carrot dust,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just get a normal carrot and eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we head to break, I want to ask
you, what are some of your favorite types
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis to work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: So fresh cannabis pollen and young leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean a leaf that's like a shoot of like
an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, is there a certain variety of
cannabis that you like to use?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to stay away from ultra,
ultra gassy turp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Style things when it's going to be eaten
raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get a huge dirt profile,
but some of it does show through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like, like popcorn buds to pickle
whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pickle up whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pick up good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if they're the size of the tip of
your pinky and you do a, like a warm bath
[SPEAKER_04]: pickle, like pour the, I get like two or
three cups of them and then pour the warm
[SPEAKER_04]: pickle liquid over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them sit at counter room room
temperature for like three hours and then
[SPEAKER_04]: put them in the jar and then put them in
the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so young, tender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get this little slick of cannabinoids
and other compounds that floats on the
[SPEAKER_04]: top.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kids pretty nice to be able to play
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: An incredible idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the infusion work on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the, do the cannabinoids bind to
anything in the pickle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just asked the perfect question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with me, I tend to layer my
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want people to open their, their
cupboard, their pantry, and I want,
[SPEAKER_04]: I need you to have a, I need them to stop
thinking of, Oh, I need to grow weed and I
[SPEAKER_04]: need to have this and Oh, it's just so
complicated to know, Jesus, what am I
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, find the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a supply, whether it's your
dispensary, your grower, your whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer, farmers are best, just like our
food source.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about cannabis and then
start making things for your pantry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you use balsamic vinegar, infuse it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It infuses either do it the old fashioned
way in a jar with decarbed cannabis or do
[SPEAKER_04]: it in a magical butter machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Olive oil, grape seed oil, soy sauce,
sesame oil, tamari, pumpkin seed oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: sesame seed oil, rice wine, vinegar,
apple cider vinegar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The list goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you go to make that and then use your
vinegar for the pickled cannabis buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it's cannabis and you're
pouring a liquid over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really not going to hold decarbed
temp times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to do too much of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So use half cannabis infused vinegar.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a quick smoke
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, I want to talk to you a
little bit more about different infusions
[SPEAKER_01]: that people can be working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody works with butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody works, you know, with the
commonalities, with things that we learned
[SPEAKER_01]: online that when you went back for
generations, oil, typical oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are start starting to break into
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just said, avocado oil,
grape seed oil, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still don't see like just as general
knowledge, a big palette of materials that
[SPEAKER_01]: most people work with at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of want to touch base with you
on different infusions that maybe people
[SPEAKER_01]: could be playing with that, that they can
benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to talk to you about your work
with these mushrooms and like what
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits you're seeing from them,
what kind of dishes you like making with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and just dive deeper into what Chef
Sebastian Croce is all about in his
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come right back when we get done
with our smoke sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I cannot wait to get back to this
interview with Chef Sebastian Croce.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys haven't checked him out on
Instagram already, go check him out at
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef underscore Sebastian underscore
Croce.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on this quick break,
go run, grab your pipe, grab your bomb,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab your papers, roll you up one,
smoke with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on this break, I want to give
a quick shout out to Next Light LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next Light LED is a pioneer in bright
white LED technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their spectrum is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one of the best warranties that
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a five year all component warranty
down to the very last dial.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a model to fit any style of
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Magus, I have the Froze,
I have the 420s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check them out at NextLight.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get back to our interview with
Chef Croce.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, listeners, we're back with Chef
Sebastian Croce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we went to break, we were talking
about using every part of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, including the pollen, the roots,
some of the different infusions that you
[SPEAKER_01]: like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk now, like we were saying,
a lot of people know how to work with oils
[SPEAKER_01]: and infused oils, infused butters.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some other mediums that we could
be using to infuse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you do things like sugar and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I try to stay away from the sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to let people have other vehicles
because if you are going to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: sugar, you actually have to make a high
alcohol tincture and then dump that into
[SPEAKER_04]: the sugar, evaporate the alcohol out,
the cannabinoids are left in the sugar,
[SPEAKER_04]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I tried to have people make vanilla
infused with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're making pancakes or a cake,
they can just put a little thing in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always think of these little micro
doses that you can get to build up to a
[SPEAKER_04]: macro dose if you need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But have them in everything in your
cupboard and pantry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were saying oil before because a lot
of people associate fats and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: bonding really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the most optimum extractions when
you do things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't neglect the fact that acids,
time, and other things also create
[SPEAKER_04]: infusions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can infuse vinegar because it's acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most vinegars are at 5% pH, 7% pH for a
normal vinegar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I would also recommend people,
and this is going to be weird because you
[SPEAKER_04]: see it everywhere, but people are all into
the MCT oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The coconut oil, that's the worst thing
you could have in the world for you
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's been treated to get the way
that it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coconut oil is not shelf stable and clear
at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got solids in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other kind, like the non-MCT coconut
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not used the MCT oil, but I have
seen a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was afraid about the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used that a lot, but it's always cold
pressed to find the cloudy stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The MCT oil is liquid at room temperature
and clear and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy infusion and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But realistically, it's medium chain
triglyceride.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they did is they took the full chains
away so you don't have full branch chain
[SPEAKER_04]: amino acids floating around in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only a few, three or four,
but they've stripped it of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they've taken more parts away by
taking that natural whitish opaque pulp
[SPEAKER_04]: that's in there that's the real oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've taken that away too to make it
clear, liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistically, it's just stripped.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have to use it, use it,
but I would say use olive oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overly processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, use olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live anywhere here where we live,
and we're talking, we live in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: Northwest, we have California below us,
but we also have olive growers in Oregon
[SPEAKER_04]: that are right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 50 miles away from Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a bottle of olive oil from
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Travel time's little, and I'm not bagging
on anything from Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where my family comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to buy where I can, when I can
locally because to me, it works in two
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: The farmer down the street is actually my
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he can't afford to put shoes on his
daughter's feet or a baseball glove on his
[SPEAKER_04]: son's hands because the local folks don't
buy his farm product, well, that's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: community to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So socioeconomically, it says to me,
let me buy from him when I can all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time when I can because I see his daughter
regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see the olive grower in Italy and
France's daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know her damn name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody's going broccoli,
just same with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody's growing something that you
use as a commodity in your life that's
[SPEAKER_04]: close, try it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your family eats apples, find an
orchard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go pick apples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just try to buy the $5 bag at the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might cost you $30 at the orchard to
pick the apples, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at your kid in the face when you're
doing it and be like, oh, damn,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's priceless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those things are taken out of a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we get back to where we're talking
about earlier, the commercialization of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and all that, it's like the home
growers got forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school breeders got forgotten
because it's so commercialized now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope to start the conversation off
when we first got back from break,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was to fill the cannabis pantry up and
what ways we can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to see a bunch of commercial
shit in the pantry from a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: conglomerate-style big companies when
these people can do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might not be easy to always bake
your own cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's a little easier to go and
get one from the store, but try.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might be that time where you're
going to go down the street to the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: farm or the cannabis farmer and be like,
yo, I need a half pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making olive oil for salads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making a grape seed oil for salves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm making this for this and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, do you got any calendula flowers
and what else do you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I are going to hit it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're going to hit it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very sustainable and regenerative
local farmer, and I'm very into growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one of the things that
I preach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always working with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always going out into my lawn,
picking dandelions and using that for like
[SPEAKER_01]: FPGA, which is nutrients for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even our local orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's a, you know, he's an agricultural
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get, we get all of our apples and
everything like that from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a place called Los Hernandez.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, they make tamales there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a James Beard award winning
tamale.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get asparagus tamales two weeks out of
the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that gives shit away too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, I'll tell you what, me and Carla
will drive the four hours, two hours from
[SPEAKER_04]: our house just to get those tamales when
it's asparagus season in the center of
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to check those ones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I have eight over there quite a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have excellent fucking tortillas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best tortillas around.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just got a James Beard award like two
years ago, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gotten the award that I wouldn't
dream of getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was really funny when I
was checking out your page the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm that guy that's going out in his lawn,
picking dandelion leaves, using those for
[SPEAKER_01]: FPGA and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you were talking about salt and
pepper, like that being the basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you want to be a chef, you want to
cook, you want to do this, but you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know where you're solving your
pepper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that we use the most in
cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing peppercorns?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have we have peppercorns,
but they're the reverse peppercorns.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a sejuani peppercorns.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't use the corn, you use the
husk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the one that makes the lips
tingle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a chemical in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot the name of it because you put me
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a habit of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's it's so it's the reverse
peppercorns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you only use the husk of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here in we live in the southwest
corner of our state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of you can only grow certain
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that peppercorn tree does really well
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a bush the size of the
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it produces more than we can we can
harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually moved some of it to a friend
of mine's winery so that he could get him
[SPEAKER_04]: going because he wants to do he wants to
distill it down because of its lip
[SPEAKER_04]: tingling qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works the exact same way as like a
peppercorn does just with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more bitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you get into salt,
we live here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use a ton of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like like I said,
it's the basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the cooks that used to cook for me,
they used to I used to come onto the line
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, half hour before dinner,
check everybody's set up, check
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody's stuff, check all their
consistency, all their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they used to have to go through a
mashed potato test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they hated it because it was something
simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was like, listen, if you can't make
mashed potatoes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to make my $45 steak
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to make 30 $45 a
steaks a night, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in that because you can't
make the mashed potatoes right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you make the mashed potatoes
right every night for four years,
[SPEAKER_04]: then touch the steaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wasn't really harping like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really wanted people to get the
point of if you're not consistent with the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are on the bottom that you
think are the bottom, you're never going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to hold on to the top when you
get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's like what I say about
salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the basis of our food.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really don't need nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some water, some vegetables, some salt and
peppers, you know, you talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: dandelions earlier and I was approached
by, I love dandelions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was approached by a friend of mine
during the COVID lockdown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, hey, Sebastian, I need you to
come on a show for me and cook.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just let you know, this was the vice
president of high times, John Capetta.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, you're going to see 15
million people in your 45 minute segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what'd you say,
John?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, yeah, you're going to see
15 million people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, all right, this is going
to be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really my opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they, you know, I'm sitting here with
my wife, Scott, the computer and
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody, you know, everybody's got
everything all set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got all the filming equipment here and
all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and they cut to me and I bring my
phone for the cut screen and I'm in the
[SPEAKER_04]: front yard and they're like, Oh,
we're here with chef Sebastian Croce and
[SPEAKER_04]: it looks like he's in his front yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd the kitchen studio go,
Sebastian?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, you told me I could
make anything I wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to make country fried
dandelion flowers with milk style ranch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, dandelions, dandelions
with milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And John goes like mother, I'd like to
fuck ranch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, like the one down
the street that you always go on the fuck,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I proceeded to make country fried
dandelions for 15 million people on four
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 last four 20 for during the COVID
lockdown on high times, virtual,
[SPEAKER_04]: virtual thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you, and I'm not trying to
brag, like if you've seen the last two
[SPEAKER_04]: recipes that I did for high times,
but they don't ask me to put what
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody expects high times to want as a
recipe in their magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are expecting the rice, crispy
treats, the chocolate, the this,
[SPEAKER_04]: the that, and the past, the past recipes
that I've done for them are salads,
[SPEAKER_04]: avocado toast, you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that really let people know that
there's another level that we can cook
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabinoids, cannabis, fresh
cannabis, processed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there has to be everything,
even the products that I dislike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can sit here and bash this and
that, but my grandmother is going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: to an age where she can't make her own
infused olive oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she can't go to the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: She can't do this and she can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when that time comes for my
grandmother, your grandmother,
[SPEAKER_04]: me, you, anybody else that's thinking
about their health and their life,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want there to be reputable products on
the shelf, not products like, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to bag on Coca-Cola or soda,
but I don't want the Cokes and Pepsi's on
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's going to be,
but there needs to be room for the medium
[SPEAKER_04]: size guy and the small guy all at the same
fairness across the board so that the
[SPEAKER_04]: people can make the choice because there
is levels of buyers that are out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and there's, there's,
there's people out there that think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not guilty, but I mean, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to have to edit that
out just so I don't get sued.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a firm believer that there's a reason
why we're at where we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I won't, like I said,
I won't stand behind products.
[SPEAKER_04]: When there's question behind a person
behind it or anything like that without
[SPEAKER_04]: having to name anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just, it, uh, it makes me feel
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as a, as a chef, I don't know if
you know my story, but when I was 17,
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the Puget Sound in Seebeck,
Washington, and I had a lot of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, growers in the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my English teacher was a grower and I
found out that cannabis had a value and I
[SPEAKER_04]: really didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't smoke cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he'd be like, here,
give me a little half ounce and it stinky
[SPEAKER_04]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all my friends were like, where'd you
get that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally he got to the point where
he was like, Hey, can you deal with these
[SPEAKER_04]: five pounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you deal with this five pounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'd be like, okay, give me the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it'd be like, can you deal with
these 10 pounds, 10 pounds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started driving across the hood canal
where I lived and going to Benigno,
[SPEAKER_04]: going to Brennan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually was making like two or three
runs to through day Bob Bay, the Victoria,
[SPEAKER_04]: like twice, three times a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know the coast guard was
watching me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got caught and I got caught with 32
pounds of cannabis in a little fishing
[SPEAKER_04]: boat and I got a seven year sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, from my 17th, 18th and 19th
birthday, I was at Walla Walla and a
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington state penal system at the
Washington state penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I moved from Walla Walla to Clawlum
Bay, which is another closed custody
[SPEAKER_04]: facility up in Clawlum Bay and the right
up on the overlooking Victoria Island
[SPEAKER_04]: where I got caught, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course McNeil Island and
Monroe, I was at a few other, the
[SPEAKER_04]: penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a 17 year old, I did five and a half
years in the Washington state
[SPEAKER_04]: penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got out and went to culinary
school in Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I was finishing culinary school,
I noticed that the paperwork to do my
[SPEAKER_04]: internship was at the presidential estate
in Walker point, Maine, where I have
[SPEAKER_04]: family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never going to get this, but I'm going
to apply for this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was the first one they called and I
was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to fill out top secret paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I called my mom and I said,
mom, you know, I know I've, I know I
[SPEAKER_04]: fucked up when I was a kid and I got in
trouble, but they're asking me on the
[SPEAKER_04]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh my gosh, if I've been
convicted of a felony and I feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: lying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, just don't lie this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really just don't lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I need a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, I'm broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, just don't lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put it on there and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've had plenty of times where they've
told you no go cause you've put it on
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I put it on there and they're like,
okay, can you come for an interview with
[SPEAKER_04]: the secret service on Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I was in prison for five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, can you come for an
interview on Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said the company that you worked
for, Kate porpoise kitchens, will they
[SPEAKER_04]: vouch for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I'm in prison as our cozy of
Francis house three days a week on a
[SPEAKER_04]: private contract.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll be okay with the Bush family
and I have nothing political, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, then they pull my jacket from
prison, make sure, and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so I ended up doing three days a
week at the Bush residence in Walker
[SPEAKER_04]: point, and then right across the sound
from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or peninsula or if miss or whatever it's
called is presidents are cozy of France,
[SPEAKER_04]: the former president of France property.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would do three days a week there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of cool because I went from
prison to two presidents, one of a foreign
[SPEAKER_04]: country and one of our country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would sit in the back of their
houses and smoke weed every day that I
[SPEAKER_04]: worked there and it felt really good,
but I'd never thought that we were going
[SPEAKER_04]: to move mainstream in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're doing stuff locally to us
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, while we were on break, you were
talking about the papawii.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So believe it or not, the word papawii is
a native term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the only people that have a word
for it is the native folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a, it means the force of which
mushrooms are pushing themselves out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the word papawii means.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really weird because they're the
only people that have a word for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even have a word for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to dig up, you know, my,
my ancestors are Northern Italian from
[SPEAKER_04]: Abruzzo and I tried to dig up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of what we would consider
witches and people really associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: the land from where I come from in Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even have a word for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the natives and specifically the
natives here in the Pacific Northwest had
[SPEAKER_04]: a word for the force.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of which a mushroom pushes itself out of
the ground overnight with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the papawii definitely for me means
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this event is held going to be held in
November 12th, 13th and 14th on the Long
[SPEAKER_04]: Beach peninsula of Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those that know psilocybin
mushrooms, that's actually the psilocybin
[SPEAKER_04]: mushroom capital of the world in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can forage for psilocybin as a
resident, which is a, a wooden most
[SPEAKER_04]: psilocybin dense mushroom on the planet,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was, uh, discovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people discovered it prior,
but I think I know Paul Stamets from Fungi
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfecti here in Olympia, Washington,
our local hero, mycologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've actually hung out with the sun
as or several times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was the one that coined the
psilocybin as a resident and named it the
[SPEAKER_04]: Azzi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our 27 mile stretch of beach in the Long
Beach peninsula of Washington is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: Azzi capital of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially in around November,
you will see people from all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: world converging on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I operated several hotels and restaurants
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One being James Beard's old favorite
restaurant and hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I every year go and pick between six,
eight, 10 pounds of as a residence and dry
[SPEAKER_04]: them and use them in various different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, I micro dose daily that going to
prison at 17, you know, it's kind of good.
[SPEAKER_04]: These stories ran together, but going to
prison at 17 crushed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gave me PTSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you wouldn't believe they had changed
all sorts of things about a child's life
[SPEAKER_04]: and perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I live with PTSD today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And psilocybin really helps me get through
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I micro dose daily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really like the conversation that's
going to have to arise soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're talking about the powie,
but the, the conversation that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have to arise soon is like the
conversation that's that arose a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago, you know, sun grown or light,
you know, light depth, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: all this between the cannabis world and
indoor outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's lab cultured psilocybin or wild
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I treat myself with both, but part of
the psilocybin therapy that I helped push
[SPEAKER_04]: 109 and I 34 with in Oregon for the
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of psilocybin is part of the therapy is
getting out there and finding the
[SPEAKER_04]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you spend three hours out
there in the dune grass, just nature,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's part of the therapy that a lot of
people that have PTSD and depression are
[SPEAKER_04]: missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you look at the list that
they give you, you want to crawl out of
[SPEAKER_04]: your depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing to do, go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, Hey, fuck medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go for a walk and hunt for some
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing is, is that when
you're out there, you're in the dune grass
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're able to find a freshy,
a mushroom that's fresh in psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean one that's been dried in a
hydrator, dried in the sun from a
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory, but a fresh psilocybin dense
mushroom and put it in your mouth and eat
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of people are like,
Oh, I'm going to go to Brazil and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do this Ayahuasca and I'm going
to drink Iboga and I'm going to do all
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have nothing wrong with that,
but I believe that from where my ancestors
[SPEAKER_04]: came from in Italy, we didn't have any of
those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe therapy should go back to
where your ancestors originated from.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got some Latin in you,
then explore those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't, don't explore those
things because they're not made for you
[SPEAKER_04]: chemically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the psilocybin for me, that's a very
interesting point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are going to have to start
paying attention to these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, like what I was trying to get
at is like, I, well, most Americans are a
[SPEAKER_01]: big melting pot though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they're just a mixture of
everything down deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, both of my grandparents are from South
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to be doing Ayahuasca or,
but my, my grandparents are Islanders or
[SPEAKER_04]: they're this or they're that, you know,
nobody needs to be licking a fucking frog
[SPEAKER_04]: because that shit is, there was nobody
that was licking frogs except for people
[SPEAKER_04]: in Arizona when they told us what we were
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question for you really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to cut you off there, but it goes
hand in hand with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I've always
talked about my theory on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as what foods are good for you,
what type of cannabis is good for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that most people have that sensory
memory where they're attracted to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain like terpene, a certain flavonoid,
where their body says, Hey, you need some
[SPEAKER_01]: more of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you're craving something
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad that people can now tailor
their medicine before when we were living
[SPEAKER_04]: on the black market, it was like a strain
name was just something we used to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: what we were getting from the dude we were
getting it from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is vanilla fucking thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, and it's like, it was just
like a sellable of a sellable point for
[SPEAKER_04]: bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it actually matters now with the
medical industry prior to the rec industry
[SPEAKER_04]: for eight, 10 years in Oregon,
people can actually say, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you were saying something about blue dream
and it's like, you know, like that DJ
[SPEAKER_04]: short blueberry that came out of Eugene,
Oregon has led its way into all the blue
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because those med growers,
you know, and I'm not a grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I do follow genetics, especially old
genetics, especially land race genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I have to tailor my, yes,
we are going to be best friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to tailor my medicine too,
because it's like, I just don't smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Carla, we got live, we've smoked
live resin now for the past probably four
[SPEAKER_04]: years, solid, just live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't smoked flour for 18 to 20 years
after prior to that for the past 20 years
[SPEAKER_04]: has been BHO, you know, and for 15 years,
it was some raspy ass BHO from up here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the Pacific Northwest, but it was all we
had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was way better for me to smoke BHO
20 years ago off a swing plate than it was
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to smoke flour because I had to
smoke two ounces of fucking day to get
[SPEAKER_04]: where my head needed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the psilocybin micro dosing kind of
took took away from that or like how much
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis you need to consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Carla and I smoke about a gram and a
half between the two of us of live resin a
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: She tends to go for the more gassy type of
gassy wet style live resins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like like right now I'm smoking lemon
sour diesel because everybody in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_04]: grew that for like eight years in downtown
Vancouver here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that particular the lemon sour diesel
really nice for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's smoking Agent Orange, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I like California orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like all those other strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carla grew for a long time, you know,
so she's well versed better in the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and the things around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know what the black market had for
over the past 25-30 years here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Northwest and then, of course,
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet the combination of good live resin
and psilocybin therapy and trying to eat
[SPEAKER_04]: right, trying to do all the other things
right, those are the best things you can
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody, no matter if you're getting a
paycheck from Warner Brothers Studios and
[SPEAKER_04]: have multimillions in the bank in the
biggest house, those people feel bad,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people have ailments.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no separation between there's no
they're not better than us because their
[SPEAKER_04]: house is bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their fucking bills are bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we all have our different paths in
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people just go there a little bit
quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people have different
expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my expectations out of cannabis is and
even psilocybin, but more over cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're not legal in all states
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still got ways to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that the we need standardization
everywhere so that people so so
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody's grandmother in a different
state isn't having to worry about a
[SPEAKER_04]: different rule and not worrying about the
other thing is, is that in my states,
[SPEAKER_04]: two states, Oregon and Washington and in
California, I lived in California growing
[SPEAKER_04]: up, too, and they pushed it even quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical in California is that we legally
legalized and recreationalized in these
[SPEAKER_04]: states under the auspice of medicinal
values for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet all they are selling us is sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go into the dispensaries in the pot
shops, man, and it's bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to have conversations like
this so that at least two people go,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot of candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just added popcorn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And chocolates and oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about just weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get going, I wanted to touch on
a couple more points with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: How?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got lost on that for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the oh, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest things for us holding this
event is that your we like to call them
[SPEAKER_04]: campers, people that attend our events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Campers can can actually walk outside of
their room in their hotel in November,
[SPEAKER_04]: right on the beach in the dune grass and
forage for wild psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have the release of the
fantastic fungi community cookbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I contributed five recipes to the cook
community cookbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the cookbook that follows the movie
that of Louis Schwartzberg, Eugenia Bone
[SPEAKER_04]: and Paul Stamets did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a huge deal for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be creating for the we'll have
forays.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people will be able to go and forage
for King boletes, as these saffron milk
[SPEAKER_04]: caps, violet courts, some other mushrooms,
the porcinis or the King boletes are
[SPEAKER_04]: highly prized by a lot of the culinarians.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those that want to find a source
of psilocybin therapy right there as close
[SPEAKER_04]: as possible, it's a huge educational event
to be able to recognize wild psilocybin or
[SPEAKER_04]: any mushroom in the wild is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, the growers that walk
up to a plant and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: wow, this is sativa dominant, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what, huh, what,
huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like the mushroom world is
still like that to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only know like 1720 mushrooms from this
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd stick with them because they've
kept me alive this long, but the events
[SPEAKER_04]: really to throw a party for the release of
the cookbook, because that's a huge deal
[SPEAKER_04]: and bring foragers and like-minded people
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we just hosted the auto flower
cup in August.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, you know, a lot of people
with camp.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people don't know what ruderalis
is, but yet you can talk to 12 of the 30
[SPEAKER_04]: tier one growers in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh yeah, we're testing
some autos out, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got four acres going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, Oh, you mean you're testing
your abilities to make more money out is
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're doing because you're,
you're able to run three crops now and
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hosted the auto flower cup,
the second annual auto flower cup in
[SPEAKER_04]: August at an oyster farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we like to do these immersion
educational style events where we bring
[SPEAKER_04]: people not from say like this event we
did, we brought not only auto flower
[SPEAKER_04]: growers, but we brought mushroom
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought chefs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on an oyster farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had native prayer in the morning each
morning, lots of speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of going to be mirrored after
that, but more driven towards the Azores
[SPEAKER_04]: and the long beach peninsula and wild
edibles there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of a mushrooms do you like to
use that you can find out?
[SPEAKER_04]: In these areas mean my favorites,
my favorite is started last week and it is
[SPEAKER_04]: the Pacific golden chanterelle,
the white chanterelle and the cascade
[SPEAKER_04]: chanterelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually have a rainbow chanterelle
here, but I don't go after those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only get like two or three, but like
Carla and I picked probably about 25,
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 pounds just the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this weekend we're going to go to the
lowest Lewis river falls in Gifford
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinchot and look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some mushrooms down there, but it's
chanterelle season.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite as a chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody goes for a lot of the more
exotic, more expensive, harder to find
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms, but a chanterelle is one of the
most exquisite in taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most versatile to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have any bugs naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got it's immune to any bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have to worry about any of
that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's got these beautiful
apricot tones to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easily pickled, easily cooked and
easily eaten for anybody that's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you equivalent the flavor
chanterelle of a chanterelle?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I couldn't pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you asked me what a porcini or a King
Bolete tasted like, I would like it like
[SPEAKER_04]: the woods, like the good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the earth it's growing in,
like you can pull out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if your pallets really trained,
you can pull out some like apricot
[SPEAKER_04]: undertones, some nutty, nutty,
nutty undertones to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but nothing in particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, where and how that
chanterelle was grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this past weekend, we picked a white
chanterelles and I'll tell you what,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're even, they're like, they're going
wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going crazy this year because of
the weather, the weather each year,
[SPEAKER_04]: we get a new like flush of what's going to
come in a heavy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like two years ago, we drove over
where over by where you live because you
[SPEAKER_04]: had a lot of wildfires and the Morales,
the burn Morales were prevalent over
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, that's pretty cool
that you're into the chanterelles because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody around here is about the
Morales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, see it's actually my, it's not my
least favorite, but it's my, my least
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite is a big, big King Bolete or
porcini because it's going to be buggy
[SPEAKER_04]: when I got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I eat like some of those, you just
want to slice and eat, but I like
[SPEAKER_04]: chanterelles that are no bigger than my
thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not big and floppy eared and I love
Morales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like burn Morales a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like true Morales more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like blonde's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love lobster mushrooms, although I
don't, we don't eat a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I love lobster mushrooms, cauliflower,
mushrooms, well, lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually don't find lion's mane here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We find bears tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get oyster mushrooms and cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no, no cordies, but we get lots of
oysters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can just, so here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carla gets mad because like, I'm like
played out on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've like seven years of picking
oyster mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, I'm not going to pick damn
oyster mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for chanterelles season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, no, no, no, no,
we need it every season.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I, uh, I thoroughly love going
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime you want to head out this way,
you're more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you and I, we vibed together
pretty damn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like we, we have a lot of
the same similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely need to do another podcast
together, but before we get going from
[SPEAKER_01]: this one, I wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could shout out like a quick
recipe for our listeners that they can try
[SPEAKER_01]: at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one that I was interested in was
that you put, I, I'm not a big drinker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate a nice scotch every once in a
while on a special occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like Michelada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you posted about a marijuana
Michelada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do it in two ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of my favorites,
like I said, build a cannabis pantry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you like absent, make some
absent infused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't want to make it in the
machine, do it the old way and just decarb
[SPEAKER_04]: some bud, put your favorite rum,
whiskey, liquor into a Mason jar with the
[SPEAKER_04]: decarb bud and let it sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got acid in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got alcohol in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to, it's got extraction,
uh, opportunities available.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody I know, and I'm going
to veer off for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about with a beer though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's only what three and a half
to, I think the max that we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington is like eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the, with that, you would really,
you want to add it to your other
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to add it to your salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to add it to your, you know,
whatever you can get it in, in that
[SPEAKER_04]: situation, we in particular have it in our
hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the way that we made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, you're making your hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot sauce with the vinegar.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually the hot sauce that I made was
not only made with cannabis vinegar,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's two tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was the peppers were fermented then
decarbed weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The peppers and liquid was added to the
magical butter machine, which is I put it
[SPEAKER_04]: on no heat at that point in time and just
did the puree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I put it on low heat, which is about
60 and did an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let that cook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I just strained it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No particles of blood or no color left
because I used why he'll peppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can even see if there was flakes of
button, but then now it's double tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the decarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to bring that flavor
through a lot of people don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are, they're really scared
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people will get like a little
toothpick of RSO on their tongue and freak
[SPEAKER_04]: out and be like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still on my tooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oh my God, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: RSO can be bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have bad RSO, but there's some
really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people like they're like,
you know, it's like some people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I want to smoke cannabis, but I don't
want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I want to eat cannabis, but I don't
want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, just make up your damn mind
and get over your fear hurdle and just
[SPEAKER_04]: say, nobody's died yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not, the room's going to spin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the worst thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the beer, I would definitely make
some hot sauce and then made your red beer
[SPEAKER_04]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can, uh, if you want to make the
sugars in this, in the salts out of
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol based tinctures, by any means you
can, and just add layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you find yourself typically
substituting sugar with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you shout it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agave nectar, but I'll tell you what,
so I'm a type one diabetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just became a type one diabetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was a type two diabetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a year ago and just became a type one
diabetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you going to talk about the sun
syrups right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a jar out there right now and agave
nectars and all that, that those are
[SPEAKER_04]: really the ways that you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if some people are like me and they
can't get away from like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: sugar, and actually I need to have it
around to direct my sugar, believe it or
[SPEAKER_04]: not, because if you're up, you're up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're down, you're down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need sugar one way, you know,
one for one and one for the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: But.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, if people can get, move away from
the hidden sugars, they don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: need to take the sugar jar off of their
counter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they can get rid of the,
if they can just be more conscious about
[SPEAKER_04]: the things like, like a hamburger just
isn't a hamburger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bun has got like 30 grams of sugar in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you go to a non sugar bun,
like say an egg bun, like a Hawaiian roll
[SPEAKER_04]: or a potato bun or something, they've even
got less sugar in them because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: made with another ingredient, like a
potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potato is like the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just recommend people think,
think about what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about how they want to do it and
think about what level of convenience they
[SPEAKER_04]: want to work with when it comes to
cannabinoids and having that pantry
[SPEAKER_04]: available and buying products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, I think we will end the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely have to do another episode.
